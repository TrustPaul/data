The Irish Times,Apr-01,2009,"April 1, 2009",Developing countries need to be put at heart of global new deal,"OPINION:While we fret about our livelihoods, in other parts of the world people s lives are at risk, JAMIE DRUMMOND. ON THE eve of the G20 summit, governments across the world, including that of Ireland, continue to grapple with extraordinary economic challenges. We are living in a new age of anxiety. As citizens we are preoccupied by concerns about work, salaries, mortgages and pensions. Our future is uncertain. We feel trapped between a challenging present and an uncertain tomorrow. However, elsewhere in the world the current economic turmoil means even more than a harsh impact on livelihoods it means an actual attack on lives. While across Europe the meaning of hardship is being rediscovered, the impact of the financial crisis is felt hardest in the developing world. As with climate change, the countries that have contributed least to today s massive problems are feeling the worst effects. This is a great global injustice. The figures are stark. The World Bank recently estimated that last year 130 to 155 million people were driven into poverty because of the food and fuel crises. Now, a further 50 million may be beaten back into extreme poverty by the financial crisis. The global economic situation is hitting the poorest of the world hard, and also undoing the progress that has been made in the last decade. Consider Africa: with the support of the international community, through debt cancellation and increasingly effective aid, African leaderships have helped put 34 million more children in school in the last seven years. In the last five years, two million more have been placed on lifesaving anti-retroviral drugs. In the last two years, new therapies and 60 million bednets treated with insecticide have helped drastically reduce malarial death rates in a dozen countries, with rates halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia. The aid innovations which have delivered these results, championed by Irish NGOs and campaigners like Bono, are increasingly dubbed smartaid to differentiate from older, less effective aid systems. The results of these developments have been real and tangible. Democracy has been spreading, economies blossoming, and poverty waning as investment has been drawn to the continent. At the recent International Monetary Fund conference in Tanzania which I attended eloquent and passionate African policymakers have been describing recent breakthroughs with justified pride, even as we now analyse how our own profligacy in the west threatens to engulf their progress. We cannot allow that injustice. Helping the developing world helps us too. Our lives are more interconnected than many realise, and more trade coupled with less illegal migration offers us all a more stable, secure world. We need to see the bigger picture, and realise that our response to the global economic crisis must consider the needs of the world s poorest along with our own. Inclusion is key. If involved, the developing world can help reboot the global economy, beat global poverty and solve global climate change. Our help is crucial, however, and one of the most important ways that we can help is by preserving aid programmes and resisting the urge to cut back hard. We are in the midst of a global crisis. It demands a global response. As well as maintaining aid programmes in which Ireland has been a global leader the EU and the G20 must put the globalised nature of this crisis at the heart of their search for a solution when they meet in London next month. There are three ways this can be done: - Resourcing:Firstly, the G20 should recognise and commit to the importance of effective aid, the most powerful example of global multilateral co-operation. Supplemental aid resources could be mobilised through IMF gold sales, a new issue of Special Drawing Rights ( which Ireland might find useful ) a better use of the capital of the World Bank and African Development Bank, auctions of carbon emission certificates, a currency transaction tax, and other innovative means. - Regulating:Secondly, the G20 must do more to enforce better regulation of offshore financial centres to curb the transfer of the proceeds of crime. The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative is sending a strong signal that there is no safe haven for stolen assets, but it needs more support. The upgrade of OECD and UN efforts to curb non-compliant tax havens, to boost domestic tax revenue and inward investment to the developing world, is crucial. - Reforming:Thirdly, the G20 must also accelerate reform of the IMF and the World Bank to reflect better the needs of the majority world. This might be perceived as a net loss of European influence, but smart aid can foster smart power. Embedding our ideals of justice and democracy into global institutions of governance will be the best long-term guarantor of our own interests, delivering a sustainable future and a secure prosperous world. Global problems demand a global response. Vocal advocates and activists are needed to remind policy makers and governments of this fact. As EU and G20 leaders meet over the next few weeks in the build-up to the London G20 summit, it is imperative they put the poorest who are now on the periphery firmly at the heart of a global new deal.  Jamie Drummond is executive director of One. In 2002, he cofounded the advocacy organisation Data (debt, Aids, trade, Africa) with Bono, Bobby Shriver, nephew of the late president John F Kennedy and son of 1972 Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sargent Shriver, and others. In 2004, he started One which merged four years later with Data. One campaigns against extreme poverty and preventable disease, particularly in Africa.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-01,2014,"April 1, 2014",UN warns that  tipping points  are irreversible; 300 scientists say higher temperatures will compromise normal human activities,"The world is at risk of ""crossing multiple tipping points"", triggering dangerous global warming, if average surface temperatures rise by 4 degrees  or more, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In the second volume of its Fifth Assessment Report, released yesterday, the panel warns of ""severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, [and] large risks to global and regional food security"".  Although the precise levels of warming sufficient to trigger tipping points - thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change - ""remain uncertain"", it says the risk of crossing multiple tipping points in Earth's climate system increases with rising temperatures. The panel's working group, comprising more than 300 scientific authors from 70 countries, says high temperatures and humidity would compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year.  The report is the second in a four-part series intended to guide governments across the world that have promised to agree a pact next year to slow climate change. Human healthThe report confirms that climate change is being felt ""on all continents and across the oceans . . . Observed impacts have already affected agriculture, human health, ecosystems on land and in the oceans, water supplies and some people's livelihoods.""  It says the most striking feature of these observed impacts is that they are ""occurring from the tropics to the poles, from small islands to large continents, and from the wealthiest countries to the poorest"" - although it is the poorest who will be hardest hit. ""Nobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change,"" panel chairman Dr Rajendra Pachauri told a press conference in Yokohama, Japan, where a 44-page ""summary for policymakers"" was released.  It warns that some risks of climate change are ""considerable"", even if warming is capped at 2 degrees - currently the international goal.  For example, it would have an impact on human health, mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist. Heatwaves and fires""Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, [with a] greater likelihood of injury, disease, and death due to more intense heatwaves and fires."" Climate-change impacts would ""slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger.""  There was also an increased likelihood of under-nutrition resulting from lower food production in poor regions and increased risks from water- borne diseases. The magnitude and severity of such negative impacts would ""increasingly outweigh"" any positives.  ""It is true that we can't find many benefits of climate change, and I believe it's because there aren't many benefits, even though we tried really hard to find them,"" working group co-chairman Dr Chris Field said. In many places, there would be ""widespread negative impacts"", he added.  ""We live in an era of man- made climate change,"" working group co-chairman Vicente Barros told the Yokohama briefing.  ""In many cases, we are not prepared for the climate-related risks that we already face. Investments in better preparation can pay dividends.""",1
The Irish Times,Apr-01,2015,"April 1, 2015",Berlin and Paris show new resolve in wake of tragedy," After three years of mixed messages and missed chances, two tragedies in three months have kickstarted the stalled Franco-German motor. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President FranÃ§ois Hollande held a joint cabinet meeting in Berlin yesterday and vowed to work closer on bilateral economic reforms and to drive forward common defence with a European Union drone project. Amid lingering shock over January's Charlie Hebdo massacre and last week's Germanwings crash in the French Alps, security and anti-terrorism measures were top of the agenda yesterday. And, at a joint press conference, the two leaders from competing EU political camps presented a grim but united front amid continued uncertainty over the EU's future with Greece - and with Russia. ""The first three months of 2015 were a test, one in which we have moved closer together,"" said Dr Merkel. She thanked Mr Hollande and his government for their assistance since flight 9525 crashed a week ago in the French Alps, killing 150 people - half of whom were German nationals. Dr Merkel reserved special thanks for the ""unbelievably big hearts"" of tireless recovery workers and locals in Seyne-les-Alpes who hosted families of the victims. ""They have shown in inimitable fashion what Franco- German friendship means,"" said Dr Merkel. Mr Hollande suggested the tragedies had moved the Franco-German relationship to a new level of ""fraternalism"", highlighting the need for closer co-ordination of anti-terrorism and security measures. Tighter travel security In particular he called for a registration of all people moving in the passport-free Schengen area, and tighter security measures for both air travel and pilots.  Besides recalling their respective tragedies, Dr Merkel and Mr Hollande reiterated their determination to build on the second Minsk ceasefire agreement between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatist that they helped broker in an all-night session last month. After three despairing years, Paris-Berlin watchers said yesterday the meteorological end of winter has finally seen springtime return to the Franco-German relationship.  ""Ukraine suddenly brought the question of war and peace back into the room, making us realise this was about our common freedom and security,"" said Claire Demesmay, analyst at Berlin's DGAP think tank. ""Suddenly we realised that differences of opinion that sometimes arise are irrelevant."" Mr Hollande ran for office in 2012 by promising an end to the Merkellian austerity drive in Europe with a new era of investment and fiscal stimulus. When, in office, he found this was easier said than done, Paris and Berlin entered a political stalemate. The centre-left Frenchman and centre-right German chancellor showed little in common except a determination not to give ground to the other. Berlin intransigence on austerity was met with Parisian procrastination on economic reforms. Concessions  Yesterday, with reforms under way back home, Mr Hollande knew to avoid calls for further concessions in Berlin. German public opinion towards France is already stretched after a series of Brussels deadline extensions for Paris to bring its budget into line with EU fiscal rules. As the two accentuated the positive, a French journalist punctured their steely resolve by asking Mr Hollande how he planned to react to his fourth electoral drubbing in weekend regional elections. The president insisted he wouldn't comment on domestic French politics except that ""support for investment and pushing social justice"" was the best response to extremism and populism. Dr Merkel refused to follow his line, saying the best answer to political populism was sustainable bilateral and European projects of clear, practical benefit for citizens. On Greece, both played down the visit of Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras to Moscow and insisted sooner was better than later for Athens to present reforms and free up outstanding EU-IMF loans. Finally, in an uncertain world, Mr Hollande and Dr Merkel said the time had come to have a European defence drone - backed by Berlin, Paris and Rome - to be in action by 2025. The French leader said the drones, combined with new European satellites, would grant the EU a new independence to gather its own information and images from conflict zones. ""Pictures are power,"" said Mr Hollande. ""Whoever has the pictures and knows the situation can act best.""",1
The Irish Times,Apr-01,2017,"April 1, 2017","Ireland, Brexit and borders; The UK's EU departure threatens the values of the Belfast Agreement, and Ireland is ill prepared to respond. This authoritative collection deserves a wide readership at a time of profound change","John Coakley, the professor of politics, defines nationalism as an ideology and political mobilisation aimed at addressing the ""perceived absence of fit between the boundaries of the nation and the boundaries of the state"". The question of how to fit them together or keep them apart in Ireland suffuses Dynamics of Political Change in Ireland: Making and Breaking a Divided Ireland, a book dedicated to his scholarly work.  Coakley's fellow political scientists, sociologists and historians range authoritatively over the politics of Ireland and Northern Ireland, their relations with Britain, and how the European Union and other international actors have influenced agreements, institutions and change on the island. Coakley's research into Irish politics and nationalism, Irish-British relations and comparative ethnic politics continually informs their work.  It is a complex and cautionary tale. The prolonged efforts to find a settlement in Northern Ireland through the 1998 Belfast Agreement are themselves subject to domestic and geopolitical shifts that make apparently permanent arrangements contingent and fragile. The book was completed after last June's Brexit referendum in the UK. As Brendan O'Leary puts it, the anniversaries of 1916 and the Battle of the Somme, ""long feared by governments and professional historians as potential sources of instability, have proven much less consequential than the two unanticipated referendums held in 2014 and 2016, which have jointly put into question three unions"".  Asymmetry  These unions are between Scotland, England and Wales in Britain, between Britain and Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, and between the UK and Ireland in the European Union.  Paul Arthur points to the ""huge asymmetry of power relations"" between Ireland and Britain. Western Europe's most effective imperial state was ignorant of the smaller island, while Ireland brought a suffocating and claustrophobic binary to the relationship. Membership of the EEC/EU changed that by widening relationships and providing a model of negotiated governance to influence the Belfast Agreement.  Jennifer Todd asks how durable that agreement is following the two referendums. Why has the agreement become prone to crisis since 2012 over flags and emblems and successive rows over funding and individual projects? In the 1990s the global environment encouraged an inclusive and fair settlement capable of dealing with pluralist identities and mutual respect. These values were inscribed in the agreement but are not sufficiently practised to sustain it. A new political conjuncture has shifted international priorities. Changing conceptions of sovereignty and power, in England especially, threaten its unions with Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as with the European Union.  Brigid Laffan describes how the new EU context changed the Irish State and nation. Its most important impact was to offer Ireland ""a way of diluting its excessive economic dependence on the EU and mediating the asymmetry of the bilateral relationship between a large and a small state"". But the 2016 referendum means the nations and states of both islands ""face a more uncertain future than at any time since 1973, when both joined the EU"".  Joe Ruane asks how Ireland's crises, in the North concerning the peace process and in the South relating to economic austerity, can best be modelled to anticipate rather than predict likely outcomes. He concludes that mutual spillovers are on balance unlikely, even those arising from Brexit, because of the relative normalisation of the Border between them.  Banal everyday discourse  Niall Ó  Dochartaigh subtly portrays how that normality is reinforced by banal everyday media, institutional and political discourse, notwithstanding all-Ireland nationalist rhetoric. Yvonne Galligan and Melanie Hoewer empirically and theoretically document gender inequality and women's activism in both parts of the island. Michael Gallagher, Jonathan Tonge and John Garry provide rich analysis of nationalised electoral competition, political parties and Sinn Féin's contrasting appeal north and south. Andy Pollak's detailed chapter on North-South co-operation under the Belfast Agreement, with EU funding, ascribes the suboptimal outcome so far to northern intransigence and southern indifference. The Fine Gael-led governments from 2011 ""felt little ownership of the Northern peace process"". Katy Hayward and Kevin Howard bitingly argue in the book's final chapter that the 2004 referendum, which ruled out birthright citizenship, privileges concerns about immigration over fuzzy boundaries and multiple identities. Those values of the Belfast Agreement are now under threat from Brexit. Defending them may require a radical shift of gear on Irish unity and European integration for which Ireland is ill prepared intellectually and politically. That is why we should appreciate such a high-level discussion of the issues involved.  This book is far too highly priced for its potential wider readership in a time of profound change whose contours it illuminates so well. It ought to be made into an accessible paperback and presented as the first in a series of studies from talented and critical authors such as these.

The Irish Times,Apr-10,2009,"April 10, 2009",Budget package succeeds in redistributing wealth,"ECONOMICS:Close analysis shows that those on the lowest incomes made gains this week, write TIM CALLAN CLAIRE KEANEand JOHN WALSH THE SUPPLEMENTARY Budget had to take steps towards restoring balance to the public finances. How has the burden of adjustment been shared? For a reliable answer to this question we must analyse how the tax, levy and welfare changes affect a large-scale representative sample of the population rather than a handful of hypothetical families. Here, we use the ESRI tax-benefit model to assess the impact of Budget 2009 on the incomes of families in the CSO s Survey on Income and Living Standards, uprated and adjusted to represent the 2009 situation. Last Tuesday s supplementary budget represents the final instalment of budgetary policy for 2009. We concentrate on measuring the impact of the total package for 2009, incorporating the October 2008 budget and subsequent amendments, the public service pension levy, and the supplementary budget s levies, PRSI increases, restrictions on mortgage interest relief and reductions in some welfare payments. We have long argued that the baseline against which actual policy should be evaluated is one which ensures equal income growth for all elements of society, by indexing welfare payments and tax bands in line with growth in earnings. The same logic applies now, when wages are declining in the private sector, and public sector pay is subject to a new pension-related levy. Implementation of such a policy would mean that incomes would, in current circumstances, decline equally at all levels of income. The rate of decline is uncertain, but for current purposes we assume an average fall of 2 per cent in wages between 2008 and 2009. Average incomes for the poorest one-fifth of the population are set to rise by close to 5 per cent above the benchmark. For the next one-fifth of the population incomes on average are broadly unchanged though there are of course gains and losses within that group. Average losses for the middle and upper income groups range from 2½ per cent to more than 7 per cent. For the top 10 per cent of income earners, the losses are greatest, at close to 9 per cent. Overall the budget package is therefore strongly redistributive, with income gains for those with the lowest incomes and the percentage losses rising with income. (Similar remarks apply if the benchmark used is the traditional one of no change in nominal values of welfare and tax parameters.)- Shifts of this magnitude take place rarely, and usually over a sequence of budgets: the magnitude of these shifts in a single budget has few if any precedents. On the highest incomes, the effective tax rate, including levies, has risen from 43½ per cent in 2008 to 52 per cent in 2009. Standard rate taxpayers faced a rate of 22 per cent (including the health contribution) in 2008 and will face rates of 26 or 28 per cent in 2009. These are similar to the marginal tax rates in force in the early to mid-1990s. Where should tax policy go from here? Some indications of future base-broadening rather than rate increases are given in the budget, with much weight being placed on the forthcoming report of the Commission on Taxation. We comment on three of these. Child benefit is to be either means-tested or taxed. There is a crucial difference here. Means-testing the benefit implies a withdrawal of some or all child benefit above a given income level. This effectively creates a new tax or benefit withdrawal rate in the system, on top of those which already exist. By contrast, making child benefit taxable creates no new tax rates, but allows for a gradual withdrawal of benefit through the tax system: those on lowest incomes get the greatest net benefit, those on top incomes the least. Property tax is also mentioned, and a key element here is the structure of any exemptions or partial waivers for property tax liability for those on low incomes. Again, these can in effect create new tax rates. It is important that the design of the tax system takes these factors into account in an integrated way rather than piecemeal. Likewise, the substantial levies introduced mid-year need to be reintegrated into the main tax system. Turning to carbon tax, one element of proposals for the implementation of a tax has been to provide compensation for welfare recipients. In the light of the analysis set out above, with prices stable or falling, and net incomes falling elsewhere, the 3 per cent increase in welfare rates for this year could be seen as compensation in advance . This would speak for an early implementation of a carbon tax. The halving and eventual reduction of the early childcare subsidy steps back from one recommendation of the Commission on the Family, while introduction of free pre-schooling implements another. Much will depend on the detail here, and a key theme of the commission s work was that quality pre-schooling could be provided in different ways. It is heartening that the approach seems to be a broad one, allowing for different types of service provider rather than a single model.

The Irish Times,Apr-10,2015,"April 10, 2015","A lack of nerve, not Greece, may lead to fall of euro","The pilgrimage of Greek premier Alexis Tsipras to Moscow told a tale of two tragedies. One, perilously close to the denouement, is about Greece's uncertain place in the family of European nations; the other, still unfolding but with a storyline that foretells a calamitous final act, is about the future not just of the euro but of European integration. Predictably enough, the Greek prime minister was feted by Vladimir Putin. The Russian president's revanchist aggression in Ukraine has left his regime more vulnerable than anyone in the Kremlin would dare admit. Putin badly needs to weaken the EU sanctions regime. Shared Orthodox Christianity, an air of leftist nostalgia in Athens and Greece's desperate isolation make it an ideal target for Moscow's strategy of divide and rule. It is harder to see what Tsipras gains beyond warm words to cheer his supporters at home. The promise of a gas pipeline years hence? Any aid from Moscow would be minuscule relative to funds from the EU and IMF. Putin could do nothing to make leaving the euro any less painful. The other day Yanis Varoufakis explained how Greece had ended up here. The finance minister's is a story fluently told - of US backing for the colonels, of the havoc wreaked on industry by the EU's free-trade rules, of the Brussels funding that bankrolled clientelist politics in Athens, of cheap euros creating a ruinous bubble. Varoufakis is right when he says the present debt burden is unsustainable. Missing from the narrative, though, is any sense that Greece must make its own choices. That, whatever the sins of others, only Athens can decide whether Greece prospers as a modern democracy or slips back into the shadows of the Balkans. The omission is at the heart of what so frustrates Athens's partners. This is not just about the Germans. Tsipras is isolated among fellow debtors as much as creditors. What unites them is a demand that Athens produce a plausible plan reform plan - to modernise its administration and politics as well as its economy. Such a plan would transform the mood of negotiations. Russia's trademarks Putin's preference is otherwise. A collapse in Greek living standards would leave it ripe for the coercion and subversion that are Russia's trademarks in an effort to expand its influence and control in southeastern Europe. Putin already has Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban in his breast pocket. His agents are working to promote instability across the Balkans. Yet talk to finance ministers and central bankers across the rest of Europe and the mood is one of fatalism. They will tell you the euro zone would withstand Greece's departure. This is not 2008, or even 2012, they say. Governments have put in place the mechanisms to deal with crises. Some sound as if they believe the euro would be stronger in the long run. In a narrow sense they may be right. But Greece is a distorting prism. Its sequential crises have bred complacency by distracting from the structural flaws and political challenges that still imperil the euro. Making monetary union work demands more than proficient crisis management. Spring has seen a burst of sunshine in the European economy. Quantitative easing is having an effect. Growth has picked up a little. Yet it is a delusion to think the euro is in safe harbour. Fiscal and financial union are at best half-completed, and the political threat to the euro continues to grow. National politicians refuse to admit the supranational imperatives of the project they are pledged to safeguard. And a return to growth rates of 1 or even 2 per cent will not be enough to restore the euro's legitimacy among angry voters. In 2012, European leaders defied the markets by summoning up the political resolve needed to save the single currency. They have since lost the will to sustain it. Greece may not bring down the euro; the existential threat lies in the more generalised failure of nerve and leadership. So it is, too, in the relationship with Moscow. The biggest danger to Europe comes not from Putin's rusting aircraft carrier, his cold-war nuclear bombers or Soviet-style subversion. No, the real weakness lies in a European mindset that prefers to temporise and equivocate than to confront Putin head on. Tsipras's visit may have held up a mirror to Greece's troubles. But it also offered a reflection of diffidence and division across Europe. If Greece falls out of the euro it will also fall out of Europe. And the failure of the euro would mark the failure of Europe. What unites these twin tragedies is the stubborn reluctance of the authors to rewrite the endings. Â© Financial Times Ltd 2015",0
The Irish Times,Apr-11,2006,"April 11, 2006",Opposition struggles to oust Hungary's ruling Socialists,"HUNGARY: Hungary's governing Socialists and their allies renewed their coalition yesterday ahead of a second round of general elections, but the centre-right Fidesz opposition failed to woo a conservative party that could boost its slim chances of victory. Sunday's first round of voting gave the Socialists and their Free Democrat partners 113 seats in the 386-seat parliament, while Fidesz took 97 seats and the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) claimed two. On April 23rd, voting will take place again in 110 constituencies where no candidate won an outright majority, and 64 further seats will be allocated proportionally according to each party's overall support across the country of 10 million people. As the main parties resumed their campaigns with rallies in Budapest, Fidesz said it must win 75 of those 110 seats to oust the Socialists, a daunting task that was made even harder by the MDF's rejection of any alliance. MDF leader Ibolya David said she had earlier offered Fidesz the chance of coalition talks, on the proviso that she became its candidate for premier. ""There was a chance that if they supported our candidate, there could be coalition talks,"" Ms David said. ""But that was weeks ago, I don't see a chance for that now. We will not deceive those who voted for us because they expect a true conservative path from us,"" she said, lambasting Fidesz for spouting populist rhetoric and spending pledges that would bloat an already huge budget deficit. But Fidesz leader Viktor Orban (42), the prime minister from 1998-2002 who faces an uncertain political future if defeated, insisted that the election could still be won. ""I tell everybody who wants to vote for change in Hungary that we have a realistic chance of victory,"" he declared. ""I urge everybody to take this last step."" Mr Orban calls the government ""limousine socialists"" who only care for the elite. He has promised lower taxes, better services and an ""economic patriotism"" that he says is lacking in prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany. Victory for Mr Gyurcsany (44), a former communist youth leader and millionaire tycoon, would make him the first premier to retain power in Hungary since democracy was restored in 1989.",0

Now that we find ourselves without the option to rush out and buy a new stick blender, mower, smartphone or car, it becomes more urgent. One of the few certainties in these uncertain times is that our electronic appliances and gadgets will fail us. Their built-in obsolescence has been a feature ever since Osram in Germany worked with GE in the US and Associated Electrical Industries in the UK to reduce the lifetime of their lightbulbs to 1,000 hours in the 1920s. (For a livestream of a bulb that has worked unceasingly since it was first lit in 1901 see centennialbulb.org/cam.htm) At this time, when we need our ovens and electric showers and vacuum cleaners to keep working - especially for our cocooning elders - the practise seems more dangerous than just exasperating. It's about time we stop allowing manufacturers sell us equipment that is purposefully designed to fail soon after the guarantee is up. Fortunately, the European Commission just last month released its Circular Economy Action Plan, which seeks to compel manufacturers to design products that are sustainable, long lasting, and capable of being repurposed at the end of their lives. A key component of the plan is to establish a new ""right to repair"" as part of EU consumer law, so that repair services, spare parts and repair manuals are available for all products. But to ensure concrete initiatives are implemented to match these aspirations requires consumer pressure from us. The fight isn't easy. For the last decade American farmers have been battling for the freedom to fix their John Deere tractors as they have been doing for the last century, until the company computerised the engines to such a degree that they can now only be altered using proprietary diagnostic software that is connected to the John Deere mainframe computer back in Illinois.  Farmers are prohibited from making alterations or fixing small faults. It's a battle over who really owns the piece of machinery, as, while the farmer pays for it, John Deere claims that what they are actually paying for is ""an implied license to operate the vehicle"" for the duration of its life. Former Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and still campaigning Bernie Sanders had weighed in on the side of farmers, calling for federal ""right-to-repair"" legislation. But while 23 states considered implementing legislation in 2019, none of them actually passed a law. We're more fortunate with the EU, but the struggle to reassert autonomy over the things we purchase will be long and hard. In the meantime we should be conscious of choosing brands and products that are built to last. Internet reviews give a good sense of the longevity of an item. We know, for example, that Neff and Miele appliances are likely to last longer than cheaper brands. Although, even these are now opting for cheaper materials - such as plastic buttons as opposed to metal ones that can cope with the heat and strain over many decades.  The best option of all is to get to know your local repair shop. They have delved into the belly of every electric beast in your home and can discern the great ones from those that are heaped in a pile outside their back door ready for scrappage. Ask their advice on the best brands, or better still buy a reconditioned device from them.  Inquire locally about who the best person in your area is, or check out the repair people listed on myappliancerepairs.com, who have all been vetted by the site owner Ray Kelly.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-12,2005,"April 12, 2005",Hurley cites risks to growth,"Recent data suggest the euro-area economy is unlikely to strengthen soon and the monetary policy environment is cloudy largely due to volatile oil prices, Central Bank governor John Hurley said yesterday. In the most explicit statement yet about the depth of ECB concern over the economic outlook, Mr Hurley added that a rise in long-term oil futures prices was a ""new and worrying"" feature of oil markets. 20050411224534 Other risks to growth included widening global current account imbalances, sharp upward moves in the value of the euro, and strong growth in money and credit within the euro zone on the back of low interest rates, he said. ""The strengthening of the exchange rate has acted to slow activity and the potential for further volatility in foreign exchange markets remains an important downside risk to growth,"" Mr Hurley said in the text of a speech to financial markets association ACI Ireland last night. Mr Hurley reiterated remarks he made last month in saying that the European Central Bank (ECB) would have to remove monetary stimulus at some time but that, against the uncertain economic outlook, it was difficult to say when that would be. Following the ECB's decision last week to leave interest rates unchanged at a historic low, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet gave a guarded reading of the euro zone outlook and cited oil as a risk. But Mr Hurley went further. A member of the ECB governing council, Mr Hurley said the central scenario was for moderate growth in the euro area economy although ""the pace and timing of any pick-up is subject to much uncertainty"". ""More recently the signals with regard to the outlook for growth have been mixed,"" he noted. "" While data for January was generally favourable, ""data since then has been less supportive"". - (Reuters)",1
The Irish Times,Apr-12,2006,"April 12, 2006",Oil edges toward all-time high over supply worries,"Oil pushed towards an all-time high of $70 (EUR 57.70) a barrel yesterday as markets fretted over supply threats in Iran, Nigeria and Iraq, as well as strong demand in the US and China. Iran is at odds with the West over its atomic programme, rebels have knocked out nearly a quarter of Nigeria's output and Iraq's exports are at their lowest since the US-led invasion. Strong buying from investment funds pushed London Brent crude to $69.70, while US crude swept to a high in the session of $69.45. ""It is pretty clear that we can break $70 without too much problem,"" said Deborah White, an analyst at SG CIB in Paris. ""We have been getting a massive injection [ of investment fund money] in the energy markets. It is very clear from the price action that they haven't stopped."" The hike in prices was stemmed by mid-afternoon, however, with US crude heading back to $68.00 and London Brent at $68.39. Oil has climbed by 13 per cent since the start of the year, extending a rally that began at $20 at the start of 2002. ""The ultimate deterrent for the oil market is when the price becomes too expensive for people to fill their tanks,"" said Ian Henderson, fund manager at JP Morgan Fleming. ""I think they will continue to carry out their travel plans even with oil prices as high as $100 a barrel."" The world's economies are racing ahead despite energy costs at their highest in real terms for a quarter of a century. US oil contracts for June onwards are already trading above $70, suggesting few traders expect the price to come off suddenly. ""With the US and global economies still showing strong signs of resilience, expectations for oil demand growth in 2006 and 2007 remain robust,"" Deutsche Bank said in a research note. Markets were already jumpy yesterday in the wake of the uncertain outcome in Italy's general election. Niall Dunne, financial markets strategist with Ulster Bank, said the election's close result had been a disappointment for the markets. He said any government formed now would have a very small margin of power with which to implement necessary economic reforms. Mr Dunne also worried about the effect of any legal challenge against the actual election outcome. Uncertainty about a clear winner in Germany last year weighed on the euro for months, he noted, acknowledging that interest-rate trends could help to ease such pressures. ""From a market perspective, the prospect of further euro-zone rate hikes should minimise the impact of Italian political uncertainty on the single currency,"" said Mr Dunne. He suggested, however, that an election re-run could signal a return to last year's populist politics, when Italian minister Roberto Maroni called for Italy to abandon the euro.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-12,2006,"April 12, 2006",WTO tips 7% rise in global trade,"Global trade may grow 7 per cent in 2006, up from last year's revised 6 per cent expansion, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said yesterday in a forecast it warned was uncertain. In its annual review of trade trends, the WTO said the outlook was based on expected world economic growth of 3.5 per cent, slightly faster than the 3.3 per cent rise in 2005. ""World trade is expected to benefit from this slightly stronger economic growth - in particular in the European Union,"" the world trade body said in the report. But it cited a number of downside risks, including the possibility that US economic growth could falter due to higher real interest rates and energy costs, and that the fledgling EU recovery would not gather momentum. ""The global economic situation at the beginning of 2006 remains full of uncertainties,"" the WTO warned. Improved corporate finances and stock market gains seemed to point to a long-awaited recovery in investment in Europe, but private consumption remained fragile, it said. WTO director-general Pascal Lamy said in the report that the global trading system was in transition, and the best way to handle it would be to conclude the Doha round of free trade negotiations by the end of the year. ""In such a climate of uncertainty, [ WTO] member governments must strengthen the global trading system by making it more equitable and relevant,"" he said. World trade, as measured by merchandise exports, had grown by an exceptional 9 per cent in 2004 but growth slowed to about 6 per cent in real terms last year, reflecting weaker global economic activity in the period, the WTO said. The final 2005 figure was slightly below the 6.5 per cent predicted this time last year.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-12,2008,"April 12, 2008",Construction employment tumbling as homebuilding slows,"  EMPLOYMENT IN the construction industry continues to tumble as the number of new homes being built drops sharply, according to new estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Laura Slattery and Ronan McGreevy report.   The index of employment in construction, which analyses job levels in private construction firms with five or more employees, contracted further in February and is down 11.1 per cent on February 2007. This marks an acceleration on the 10 per cent year-on-year drop recorded in January. The monthly employment index is at a five-year low, with more job losses in the sector expected. A spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) said some housing workers were finding employment in the repair, maintenance and improvement sector, which is estimated to have a value of EUR 7 billion. Homeowners deciding to renovate their existing properties rather than buy new ones in the uncertain housing market, as well as work to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, was creating jobs for construction workers who had been laid off from new development sites. ""However, that sector will not take up the shortfall in employment in its entirety,"" the CIF spokesman said. The number of new housing units registered in the first three months of 2008 has plunged 67 per cent compared with the same period last year. Some 45,000-50,000 new homes are expected to be built this year, compared to 78,000 in 2007 and a peak of 93,400 in 2006. The Minister for Finance and taoiseach-designate, Brian Cowen, yesterday blamed an oversupply of housing for the slump in construction employment. Mr Cowen said the oversupply happened during the record years of housing growth in 2006 and 2007, and that the number of houses expected to be built this year represented a more sustainable level of housing construction. ""That oversupply is now feeding through the system. Vis-a-vis last year, 2008 is seeing less activity and that is having an effect on employment figures because of its relative labour intensity as an industry,"" he said. He added that work on the National Development Plan would take up some of the slack, with EUR 8 billion being spent this year on capital investment projects. Mr Cowen described falling house prices as a correction in the market which was ""necessary"" and which was improving affordability for first-time buyers. He warned that it was wrong to ""talk ourselves down into a depression or a recessionary cycle"", which he said was not appropriate because the economy was still performing strongly. But Alan McQuaid, economist at stockbroking firm Bloxham, said a further deterioration in construction employment was on the cards in the coming months, while the construction purchasing managers' index, to be published on Monday, would show a further contraction in activity. Some 150,000 housing industry workers face an uncertain future, according to Fine Gael labour affairs spokesman Damien English. The skills of some 30,000 construction industry apprentices were being superseded as the Irish economy weaned itself away from the building boom, he said. Mr English reiterated Fine Gael's call for a national skills and training system. ""There is still no national strategy to ensure a successful shift from construction to knowledge and service industries,"" he said.  ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-12,2011,"April 12, 2011",Start-ups taking a step up with the help of multinational investors,"BELFAST BRIEFING:Big international players are acquiring indigenous high-tech firms and helping them grow, writes FRANCESS McDONNELL COULD A new generation of step-ups rather than spin-outs prove to be the silver lining of the dark clouds hanging over the North s economy? If the latest multimillion-pound acquisition by an American industry leader is anything to go by then perhaps there may be a recessionary rainbow in sight. Belfast-based Omiino was the brainchild of three local entrepreneurs who had racked up many years of experience working in the telecommunications industry for companies such as Nortel and Flextronics. Like many talented people in the North who realised their particular sector was facing a very uncertain future, Gary Hamilton, Mark Carson and Andrew Brown decided to take a risk together. They established not a traditional spin-out company but what has been called a step-up high-tech firm, specialising in programmable microchips. Barely four years since they went into business their brainchild has been acquired for an undisclosed sum and has become part of Silicon Valley group Xilinx. The acquisition of Omiino is far from a rarity in Northern Ireland these days. In fact, it is just the most recent example of a series of stealth acquisitions by big companies who have swooped on what were previously some of Northern Ireland s most promising, indigenous firms. In the last 12 months two of Belfast s high-tech stars, Lagan Technologies and apt-X, have been snapped up. Lagan Technologies, which specialises in government-to-citizen technology, was acquired by the US software group Kana, while apt-X was taken over by UK-based wireless technology group CSR. These start-ups are in good company when it comes to selling out and becoming part of a bigger corporate family. They join the likes of Wombat, the Belfast software company which the New York Stock Exchange bought for EUR 200 million, and Lisburn-based technology specialists Kelman, which was acquired by GE Energy. These and other multimillion-pound deals such as the sale of Tomcat Systems, the cardiac information software specialist, to Philips and the acquisition of food processor Moy Park by the Brazilian group Marfrig have helped to safeguard thousands of jobs. Invest NI, the regional economic development agency, believes these types of acquisitions are an endorsement of what the North has to offer to global companies and are helping expand both the local skills and research base. According to the Belfast-based venture capital fund manager Crescent Capital, they also highlight how Northern Ireland is fast developing its own inward investment programme. Deirdre Terrins, one of Crescent s investment managers, believes these acquisitions are proof that Northern Ireland has the ability to create and grow world-class firms.  What we are seeing here is foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland by acquisition. International companies are investing in established, venture-backed Northern Ireland companies and they are helping to grow these companies to the next level. The successful acquisition of local companies helps create further investment opportunities and job opportunities for Northern Ireland, Terrins said. Crescent has an established track record for backing the right company in this respect. It was an early investor not only in Omiino but also Lagan Technology and apt-X. But apart from an early source of finance what Omiino, Lagan and apt-X also have in common is the fact their success was built on the back of the vision and determination of local people. In Lagan Technology s case Des Speed joined its original founders to create a winning customer relationship management product for government. Noel McKenna successfully inspired apt-X to develop and sell its world-beating audio-compression technology to global organisations such as Apple. It is entrepreneurs such as these, who are prepared to step up to the challenge and embrace the risks of going into business and in many cases putting their own money on the line that Northern Ireland needs to encourage. Local entrepreneurs who sell on their hard-won start-ups to internationally recognised corporations and groups are not selling out they are trading up, which is exactly what the North s economy needs to do now.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-12,2012,"April 12, 2012",A draining of hope as austerity grinds its people down,"LETTER FROM GREECE:Democracy gives people very cold comfort one of the few growth areas is pawn shops, writes RICHARD PINE THE BODY language at meetings of the Greek cabinet tells us much. There is the diminutive figure of interim prime minister Loukas Papademos dwarfed by the two Pasok heavies , portly Evangelos Venizelos, the finance minister, and the even more portly Theodoros Pangalos, who is infamous for two pronouncements: in 2010 he proclaimed mazi ta fagam (we all squandered the money), referring to the misuse of government funds; and, in 2011, he stated that, on a declared annual income of over EUR 600,000, he could not pay the EUR 7,500 property tax for which he had been assessed (on his 57 properties). The demonstrable prosperity of Pangalos and Venizelos occasions derisive jeers in the kafeneion (local bar), but it also provokes doubts about the so-called government of national unity which includes the main former opposition party, New Democracy, which many commentators criticise for being in both government and opposition at the same time. While many applaud Papademos because he is a technocrat and not a politician, others decry the fact that he has no popular mandate: he was put in place at the insistence of the EU and the International Monetary fund. The fact that, for a year before his appointment, he was economics adviser to his predecessor, George Papandreou, suggests that this remains a Pasok-led government, with Pangalos and Venizelos as the prime minister s minders. If Pangalos and Venizelos could see the despair on people s faces (as widely reported in the national and international media), they would not continue to talk about sacrifice in the way that they do. People queue to hand in their car number plates, because they cannot afford the 2012 road tax. With incomes dropping all the time, they dig into their savings, especially the elderly who try to keep their children and grandchildren afloat. In the past year, the number of registered pawnbrokers has almost doubled, as people on the brink of destitution sell family heirlooms the trade in gold jewellery is one of the few growth industries. More distressing still is the prospect that the general election, announced yesterday, will result in a stalemate, with another coalition, of uncertain composition, taking power. The fact that neither of the major parties enjoys sufficient electoral support suggests that a range of smaller parties, each with its own agenda and shopping list, might prolong the uncertainty regarding Greece s future. Media comment is shrinking, with the bankruptcy of Alter, one of the private television channels, and Eleftherotypia, the second-largest national newspaper. Voters, particularly in rural areas, view Pasok as having reneged on its earlier promise: the rising tide lifted all boats, until the tide receded. Pasok is no longer a socialist party, says my village neighbour here in Corfu. They no longer look after the poor people.  Pasok, with an approval rating of 15 per cent, could face a meltdown at the polls as severe as Fianna Fáil s, especially because of its internal split between the traditionalists and the Europhiles. My neighbour points to the tax increases on tobacco and petrol, the 9.2 per cent increase in the price of electricity, and the withdrawal of the subsidy on heating oil (which, in Athens, has resulted in the management companies of many apartment blocks refusing to fill the tanks). The emergency property tax is being unevenly applied; originally applicable to 2011 and 2012, it has now been extended until 2014, and many doubt if it will ever be rescinded. My neighbour pays no tax, because the rents for the property he owns are rather predictably paid in cash. But those whose income is ascertainable either because they are public servants or because they pay tax online are now subject to another emergency tax, to pay the unemployed because the government cannot otherwise afford to do so. At the Ionian University in Corfu, a tenured professor has seen his salary reduced over the past two years from EUR 21,500 to EUR 15,600, which, according to statistics, puts him on the poverty line for a couple with two children. Over 20 per cent of the population is at risk of poverty nearly 600,000 households and 2.2 million citizens. Another lecturer, untenured, who was working for the minimum monthly wage of EUR 700, was told he will be paid EUR 130 per month for a 12-hour week. He resigned and is now teaching at a private school in Athens for EUR 30 per hour, while his students in Corfu are left without a teacher. Papademos has warned that the next few months will be crucial for the country s future. His task is to keep the coalition together so that budgetary targets are met, and administrative reforms, such as deregulation of protected professions, are carried out both of which are prerequisites if the next bailout is to be achieved. One target is the creation of 150,000 jobs in the first quarter of this year. But it is already admitted the planned reduction in the budget deficit will not be achieved, and the unemployment rate is rising, not falling. It s a litany of tax, tax, tax. Young people are doing everything they can to find a way out. The upcoming elections are viewed with utter cynicism. There s a word for it: sperectomy the draining out of hope.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-13,2010,"April 13, 2010","Gillett, Hicks lose control","ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE:TOM HICKS and George Gillett s control over Liverpool is ebbing away after the Royal Bank of Scotland conditioned its latest refinancing offer to the co-owners on the appointment of an independent chairman as well as a commitment from the Americans to sell the club. Hicks and Gillett are expected to confirm within the next 48 hours their intention to sell Liverpool eventually, with an announcement that Barclays Capital has replaced Rothschild and Merrill Lynch as the bank searching for new investors. The appointment of Martin Broughton of British Airways as the chairman is due to be ratified by the Americans this week, signalling increased influence in the Anfield boardroom by the largely government-owned RBS. The deal represents a six-month extension to Hicks and Gillett s existing arrangement with the bank and affords the Americans added time to find an investor willing to meet their EUR 565 million asking price for the club. It also reduces the threat of a fire-sale of key assets such as Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard this summer should the co-owners fail to repay EUR 113 million of their EUR 268 million debt before July, as was stipulated in their last refinancing agreement. The failure of Hicks and Gillett to secure investment is the latest in a catalogue of unfulfilled promises by Liverpool s unpopular co-chairmen, who have had a fractured business relationship and have both been badly affected by the global economic crisis. The proposed appointment of Broughton is an attempt to break the state of paralysis over major decisions within the Anfield boardroom and gives Liverpool s lenders greater assurance over the co-owners efforts to sell. Liverpool last night declined to comment on Broughton being an RBS appointment. The former chairman of British American Tobacco, the British Horseracing Board and current deputy president of the CBI will work alongside Liverpool s managing director Christian Purslow in the search for new investment. Several parties have expressed interest in Liverpool, who need to reduce their debt before work on the stalled but critical stadium project can commence, but only one, The Rhone Group, has submitted an official offer since Purslow s global hunt for possible investors began last year. The deadline on their proposed offer of EUR 125 million for a 40 per cent stake in Liverpool passed last Monday. Hicks and Gillett are believed to be close to finalising the refinancing extension with the RBS, although what funds will be left available to manager Rafael Benitez for new players this summer is uncertain. Reports of an alternative, three-year refinancing deal with Barclays Bank have been denied by officials at Anfield and sources close to the Americans. Liverpool look increasingly likely to miss out on the revenue streams from the Champions League next season after falling six points behind fourth-placed Manchester City following Sunday s goalless home draw against Fulham. Their vice-captain, Jamie Carragher, is adamant, however, that Liverpool can withstand the impact of a season outside the European elite, a feeling shared by Anfield officials. People forget that there have been times when we haven t played in the Champions League, Carragher said. It s nothing new if we don t get there. People are saying that if we miss out, then that ll be it for us, as though we d never get there again. That s just nonsense.  Liverpool s concerns over the fitness of Torres have increased after scans on the extent of the striker s latest knee injury proved inconclusive. The Spain international underwent an assessment in Barcelona yesterday and is to remain in Spain for further treatment.  He received treatment and will continue to do so over the next few days, with the injury being reassessed later this week, the club confirmed. Guardian Service",0
The Irish Times,Apr-13,2010,"April 13, 2010",Survival the name of the game,"Philip Reidreports on how Irish golf clubs are battling to cope with the challenges posed by unprecedented times IN A nutshell, Irish golf clubs want one thing from this year: survival! And, to achieve that, the results of an Irish Times questionnaire would seem to indicate, the vast majority of clubs are showing flexibility in allowing members to pay their annual subscriptions over a phased basis, while there has been a general reduction in green fees aimed at ensuring there is cash flow which is the lifeline for any business. The feedback from our survey is that times are indeed tough, but there is a generally positive outlook with clubs tightening financial belts. Seeking to offer value for money and providing a quality service regularly come across as the main mission statements for the year ahead. Of course, it goes without saying that an improvement in the weather, something that is out of earthly hands, would go a long way to giving a shot in the arm to every club. Clubs are getting innovative. For example, three of the top links courses in the west Enniscrone, Carne and Co Sligo have organised an amateur three-day tournament for July, the height of the season, at a total cost per player of EUR 125, while the Donegal Links Challenge in the summer gives players the chance to play a 54-hole tournament at Narin Portnoo, Portsalon and Rosapenna for EUR 99 per player. Nobody can argue with that kind of value. But these remain tough times in the main. To that end, the GUI, ILGU and the PGA came together to produce a booklet to help clubs during these financially challenged times. Called Promoting Golf Membership, it provided clubs with guidelines under two main headlines: Retention of Members and Attracting New Members.  As the GUI points out, it is by no means exhaustive, nor is it a blueprint rather a tool to stimulate new thinking and debate at committee level and within the membership.  Our survey revealed that many clubs are suffering through a loss of membership, a problem that has affected clubs in every part of the island and which is reflected in some of the mission statements they have given us for the year ahead with words like survival and hanging on providing an indication of how strained the situation is as clubs are hit on two fronts, firstly by the economic downturn and secondly by the weather. What remains beyond question is that the quality and variety of Irish golf courses is as good as can be found anywhere in the world, but it is interesting to note many clubs are intent on going back to their core values of offering quality golf at good value with the sort of friendliness to green fee visitors that made the 19th hole a vitally important part of the growth of the Irish golfing industry over the past two decades. Different problems face different clubs. As Sidney Houston of Aughnacloy Golf Club remarked, in Northern Ireland our greater problem is the weather generally, people will not play in very wet or cold conditions the like of which we have experienced since mid-October last year, which covers half the year. Small clubs like ourselves suffer greatly due to this and find it very difficult to maintain a cash flow. Financial assistance in some form would be of great help, during particularly bad years.  These are tough times for the smaller clubs for sure as Highfield s Avril Duggan explains, The golf society market is very competitive and shrinking. The corporate golf courses are slashing prices and making it even more difficult for us as the corporate/banking golf market has virtually disappeared.  Joe O Flynn of Rathsallagh and Denis Kane of Druids Glen sing from a similar hymn sheet in pointing also to a new phenomenon, the growth of the so-called zombie golf courses which akin to the hotel industry are price cutting. As O Flynn puts it in no uncertain terms, As long as the zombie golf courses are being artificially supported and continue to be part of the oversupply problem and the driving down of the green fee rate, it is difficult to see an improvement on the horizon.  Kane remarked, We now have hotels, golf courses and retail businesses offering reduced rates to create momentum both for the international visitor and the domestic market. It is essential that the golf product still maintains high standards but offering great value . . . it is essential that all the tourism products of Ireland continue to promote with a greater effort and support from Tourism Ireland to encourage the markets.

The Irish Times,Apr-13,2016,"April 13, 2016",Political stalemate continues to reign; Spain,"It is indicative of the uncertain and rapidly changing state of European politics that post-election paralysis is becoming commonplace. Many established EU parties have lost a great deal of their credibility due to the economic crisis. But they have not weakened sufficiently to create space for credible alternative governments from the right or the radical left.  In Spain, the agony seems endless. Since late December, the country has struggled unsuccessfully to form a government after inconclusive elections. Spanish politics had been dominated for almost 40 years by a two-party system, alternating between the centre-left Socialist Party (PSOE) and the right-wing Partido Popular (PP), with the latter in power since 2011. The pain inflicted by both parties in their management of the economic crisis, and widespread disgust at corruption across the political establishment, led to the emergence of two brand-new parties that broke the mould in last December's poll. The PP and PSOE both fell far short of a parliamentary majority (176 seats). Podemos ('We Can'), a broad grassroots anti-capitalist movement, took 69 seats, and Ciudadanos ('Citizens'), a centre-right anti-corruption party, took 40. The economic policies of the PP and PSOE, like those of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have differed very little since 2008. But the cultural hostility between these parties, rooted in a more recent and much bloodier civil war than our own, led predictably to the still-birth of any moves towards a grand coalition between them. The PP acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, took the unprecedented step of rejecting the King of Spain's invitation to him, as leader of the largest party, to attempt to form a government. He has been content to allow the inexperienced PSOE leader, Pedro Sánchez, flounder in his efforts to cobble together an unlikely majority with Podemos and Ciudadanos. The maximalist demands made by Podemos, coupled with its internal divisions, have finally sunk any hope of its alliance with the Socialists this week. A PSOE spokesman has said that new elections, which must be called by the end of this month if no government is formed, are now inevitable. But this may not be the case. Ciudadanos has ruled out coalescing with the PSOE if Podemos were a partner, and with the PP under the leadership of Rajoy. With Podemos out of the picture, Ciudadanos could now be the linchpin of an unprecedented coalition between PP and PSOE, if Rajoy resigns. There are signs that the PP may replace him but he will not go easily. Ironically, Rajoy probably hopes that Sánchez, whom he despises, may himself be replaced. But a new PSOE leader appears unlikely to take a warmer view of the prime minister. The most likely outcome remains new elections in June - and no major changes in the results.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-14,2008,"April 14, 2008","'Governments can be like the public - they get spooked too, and get edgy as recession looms'","OPINION - DICK AHLSTROM: WHAT DO poker, advertising and scientific research all have in common? You have to be able to hold your nerve and keep putting in the cash even when things look grim. You have to keep to the programme no matter what, and tough it out to the end.   Poker provides the most obvious example of this capacity. You might get dealt poor hand after poor hand, but at some stage you are going to have to make a stand and bluff for all you are worth. You may know it is a poor hand, but act like you are holding four aces and start wagering. If your bluff works, the others will decide they just can't win and so fold, leaving the pot and the field of battle to you. I am assured the very same holds true for investment in advertising during times of recession when markets shrink, consumers stop emptying the piggy banks and governments get nervous. You don't decrease advertising spend in line with market conditions - you increase investment to keep your product before the buyer's eye. The rationale for this counter-intuitive argument seems to be that the economy may slow, but won't stop completely. The public will continue to spend, even if at a slower rate, and the product coming off the shelf will be your company's product, after a fortune spent encouraging brand recognition. The real trick, the challenge, seems to be in sticking to the programme and staying with the investment no matter what. The sales may not come at first, but if your corn flakes are better marketed than the next guy's then your corn flakes will end up in the shopper's trolley. Governments can be like the public they serve in their response to market conditions. They get spooked too, and can start to get edgy as recession looms. They look at all those careless election promises that will cost lots of extra money even as receipts from taxes and excise duties slump. The inclination is to keep the hammer away from the piggy bank and start cutting wherever possible. Shave a few million from the roads budget, defer planned investment in new schools, assign eight consultant's posts instead of 12. And it is at times like these, with a likely world recession knocking at the door of our alarmingly open economy, that planned spending in scientific research may appear like a risk-free, lose-no-votes option for a budget cut. The public won't mind, it doesn't affect them directly, so trim away amidst promises to invest the money next year. It will be interesting to see if the Government takes the poker shark's and the advertising executive's approach and keeps spending on research, despite the threat of recession. It would be the wise option because investment in the creation of a knowledge economy will pay handsome dividends in the future: dividends that will not be available if spending is cut. Research is always a risky business, an investment with no guarantee of returns, but you can't have a knowledge economy without it. If you want to ""manufacture"" knowledge and valuable intellectual property for export, you have to invest more, not less, in this uncertain activity. You also have to keep the investment flowing in order to attract the best people. Good quality research can only be done by investing in good quality people, and the international competition for their skills is fierce. Any proposal to defer or trim planned spending on scientific research as mapped out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation would serve to create uncertainty in the research community, not just in Ireland but also abroad. We have to become world players in research, and we have started down that road already thanks to the the superb investments being made by Government in the past few years. Foreign researchers can bid directly for contracts being offered here and, if selected, can take them up, so long as they conduct their research in Ireland. The object is to attract world-class researchers who then conduct world-class research here, to the benefit of the country and the colleagues who will work with the scientist. There will be less interest in this, however, if questions start to arise about continuity of funding. This holds true not just for people, but for the essential equipment needed to make credible research happen. Good research doesn't happen on the cheap, and the NDP spending includes capital funding that can be applied for equipment. The Government should ring fence planned investment in our knowledge economy to ensure our reputation for science remains intact, no matter which way the economy goes. To do any less would be foolhardy in the extreme.  ",0

The central contribution which economists can make to public policy is to clarify and inform choices. The Economists' Voice has recruited a star cast of internationally-renowned economists to address many of today's problems. Although there is a pronounced bias towards domestic US policy issues, two of the questions addressed are of global significance: the Iraq war and climate change. Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prizewinner in economics in 2001, points out in his contribution that there is no evidence that the US conducted a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the cost of going to war in Iraq. In 2002, the director of the White House national economic council, Larry Lindsey, estimated that the war could cost between $100 billion (EUR 63 billion) and $200 billion, roughly the same order of magnitude as US president George W Bush's recent expansionary fiscal package. His estimates were dismissed as exaggerated, with the US office of management and budget putting the cost of the war at $60 billion. These back-of-the-envelope calculations proved wide of the mark. Stiglitz subsequently stated to this reviewer that the reason no rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the Iraq war was undertaken by the Bush administration lay in the fact that they implicitly believed they could go to war ""for free"". After all, the costs of the Gulf war had largely been borne by the Kuwaitis and the Saudis, while a prolonged post-war occupation of Iraq was not contemplated by the administration. In his most recent book Stiglitz has estimated that the Iraq war will now cost the US $3 trillion. But would these costs, if known in advance, have influenced the US decision to go to war? Stiglitz says he believes they might have tempered the decision to invade Iraq. He argues that the ""coalition of the willing"" might have proved less willing to support a costly invasion and prolonged occupation. Without international support, particularly from Britain, the US Congress might have been less anxious to vote for war. The other major international question discussed in this readable and accessible book is how global climate change should be addressed. In 2006, Sir Nicholas Stern, himself an eminent economist, published The Economics of Climate Change. In essence, the Stern report argued that the heavy future costs imposed by global warming could be avoided by incurring relatively modest costs today. He thus recommended substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The debate on the Stern report quickly became technical. Critics argued that substantive efforts to limit CO2 emissions were not justified, both because of the uncertainty about the costs of future climate change and because these costs would not materialise until far into the future. In particular, they were critical of the manner in which Stern discounted both for uncertainty and for futurity. In an elegant paper, Kenneth J Arrow, Nobel laureate in economics in 1972, takes apart the arguments advanced by the critics of Stern. Arrow was initially trained as a weather officer and thus possesses a fund of technical knowledge on the dynamics of climate change denied to many other participants in the debate. On the basis of current emission trends, by 2035 the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would have doubled since the start of the industrial revolution, prompting a rise in temperature of at least two degrees. If business continues as usual on the emissions front, then CO2 levels in the atmosphere could be three times as high as their pre-industrial revolution levels by the end of this century. There is a 50 per cent chance that this would be associated with a rise in average temperatures of more than five degrees, roughly the same change in temperature that has occurred since the Ice Age. Arrow notes that many of the consequences of such global warming are not well known. He says there is a distinct possibility that the Gulf Stream could be reversed, leaving Ireland and the rest of Europe with temperatures resembling those of Greenland. Even with higher discount rates both for uncertainty and futurity than those used by Stern, Arrow concludes that the case for restraining CO2 emissions to present levels ""passes a benefit-cost test"". This is a genuinely useful contribution to knowledge and one that has life-changing implications for future generations.  ",0

The Irish Times,Apr-15,2014,"April 15, 2014",Can gold add lustre to a pension pot?,"Gold continues to exert a compelling attraction for investors - sophisticated and otherwise. The precious metal's value almost doubled between 2008 and 2011 before slipping back t from those highs. Part of the impetus, of course, was the financial crisis. Gold has always been seen as a safe haven and, as equities tumbled and the over-leveraged property sector slumped, investors increasingly returned to it in times of turmoil. Doubts over the very viability of the euro - and of Ireland's ability to avoid default - exacerbated the trend. Estimates of the sums placed into gold by Irish investors have varied wildly, with some fantastical figures circulating.  Now gold broker GoldCore has disclosed the scale of current investment in the metal. According to the company, Irish investors and pension owners own gold coins and bars worth over $95 million in secure vaults in Zurich, Hong Kong, Singapore and Perth Overall, the broker has over 3,600 clients, with more than $205 million in assets under management and storage. This includes $80.1 million of international clients' bullion stored in the Perth Mint of Western Australia and another $50.2 million in GoldCore Secure Storage which is coins and bars stored in secure vaults in Zurich, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company says gold plays an important role in stabilising and reducing volatility in the overall portfolio and as financial insurance to protect against worst-case scenarios. These include the risk of inflation, currency devaluations and stock and property crashes.  And the presence of pension funds among its client base is an area the company sees as an opportunity.Time bombA looming pensions time bomb means millions of people both internationally and locally run the risk of having insufficient funds for their retirement years. In Ireland it is forecast the number of pensioners will rise to 620,000 by 2020 and to 1,018,000 in 2056. There are currently 5.3 people in Ireland working for every retired person: that figure is projected to fall to just 2.1 over the next 50 years - creating an asymmetric burden due to the amount of money paid into pensions and the number of people actually receiving them. The Government has already recognised the unsustainable nature of the current pensions system: the current pensionable age of 66 is set to rise to 67 in 2021 and to 68 by 2028. Most pension funds consist of a standard mix of stocks, bonds and possibly property funds managed by external investment management firms. Yet since 2007 Irish citizens have been able to invest in gold bullion in their pension funds after the Revenue Commissioners-approved investments in gold in Self-Administered Pension Schemes via the Perth Mint Certificate Programme.  Trinity College Dublin professor of finance Brian Lucey says gold is important as a long-term diversification due to gold's ""unique properties as simultaneously a hedge instrument and a safe haven"". ""Small allocations to gold balance and stabilise pensions in the long term, and gold should be an essential part of every Irish pension fund."" Dr Lucey says there is a lack of diversification in Irish pension funds yet pensions need balance. ""Irish pension funds have been slow to embrace gold and this imbalance has cost pension holders dearly."" Pension funds need a mixture of assets - some that are safe from capital loss (at least as much as possible), some that yield a regular income, some that act as ballast against the regular cycle of other assets and some that offer significant capital appreciation. Dr Lucey says gold fits at least two of these criteria. Independent economic consultant Jim Power says gold has a very long track record and valuable investment attributes. ""In my view gold should clearly form part of a diversified pension investment.""Diversified portfolioThe UK's influential research institute Chatham House has said that gold can be used to hedge against currency devaluation and other risks as part of a diversified portfolio. ""Gold can serve as a hedge against declining values of key fiat currencies, and can also be useful for central banks looking to diversify their foreign reserves."" Ireland's largest and longest established gold broker, GoldCore, says economic uncertainty has led to a renewed buying of gold by Irish people.  ""Today's uncertain world makes the investment and pensions landscape a more challenging place for pension owners and again underlines the importance of being properly diversified and not having all your eggs in certain assets,"" said Mark O'Byrne, head of research at GoldCore.

The Irish Times,Apr-15,2021,"April 15, 2021",Raising the money for spending plans,"The Department of Finance is being forced to forecast through a fog. As prospects for the vaccine programme - vital for economic reopening - ebb and flow, it is impossible to predict the economic outlook with any certainty. As the department's chief economist, John McCarthy, said at yesterday's briefing on the latest forecasts, as well as these supply issues, just how well vaccines will work remains uncertain. The department's central forecast in the latest stability programme update (SPU) is for a gradual easing of restrictions through this year, with most gone by next year. This allows for a gradual acceleration in growth. There are key messages here for the public finances, in the first longer-term forecasts since the pandemic has hit. But they are subtle ones. The department outlines the impact of faster growth on the deficit over the next few years, which sees it moving from about 5 per cent of gross domestic product now to close to balance by about 2024. This is encouraging, as it suggests we can avoid a return to ""austerity"", the kind of emergency tax hikes and spending cuts that happened after the financial crash. Strong growth will boost tax revenues and spending pressures will ease as emergency supports wind down. However, there are two things to note here. First, there is the reopening uncertainty - further supports will be needed and, while EUR 2.5 billion is pencilled in for sectoral measures in 2022, it is really hard to know what exactly might be required. Second, the figures factor in a modest 3.5 per cent rise in what is called ""core"" spending - expenditure excluding once-off Covid-19 factors - over the coming years. The Government will want to do more on spending in a range of areas. It must decide how to raise money to fund these new longer-term plans and decide what targets to set for the deficit. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-16,2007,"April 16, 2007",Should farmers be paid to allow walkers access to their land?,"HEAD2HEAD: YES Pádraig Walshe says farmers have a right to earn an income from their property NO David Herman says farmers already receive substantial public funds and should not be paid for what most Europeans take for granted  Farmers' land has the same rights as Ruairí Quinn's front garden. It is the basis for the income of the owner and is an integral part of their livelihood. The Labour Party Access to the Countryside Bill is fundamentally flawed. Labour has ignored the partnership route and farmers have been presented with coercive legislation without any consultation. In Collen -v- Attorney General (June, 2006), Judge Seán O'Leary ruled that rights of ways could not be created without the agreement of the land owner and that such rights of ways did not exist unless through the agreement of the landowner. It is also worth noting his concluding comment, ""that the use of the concept of public rights of way as a mechanism for creating new or revising old rights for walkers is unlikely to be to a satisfactory overall solution"". Significantly, Comhairle Na Tuaithe, the forum of stakeholders set up by Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs Éamon Ó Cuív and which issued a final report in September 2006, did not propose any new legislation to deal with the walking issue. The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) recognises that the development of a network of countryside walks is in the interests of the wider society. Indeed, the development of walking routes is desirable as society recognises the need for additional recreational outlets and the development of activity-based tourism. Unfortunately, in the past number of years there has been a decline in the number of hill walkers, and the IFA has put forward proposals to address this. In the development of hill walking, it is important that a scheme be put in place that would encourage farmers to open up their land. A good example of this is the Sheep's Head Way in west Cork, which was created through the involvement of landowners and tourist interests, in a scheme that encouraged the opening up of their land. Wider society and especially walkers must appreciate that the farm is a working environment and that private property is respected. Legally recognised rights of way offer very limited access to land for recreational purposes and the IFA put forward detailed proposals on how a scheme should be put in place to address this. In July 2005, the IFA proposed the ""Countryside Walkways Management Scheme"", which addresses the issue of wider use of the countryside for recreational activity, while at the same time ensuring that farmers' legitimate rights are protected. The proposed scheme would create either linear walks or shorter looped walks in the countryside by opening a national network of walks. The establishment of such a scheme would assist the development of walks to enhance the tourist potential of rural regions and boost their economic development. The scheme would provide both capital aid for the investment needed to bring the walks up to the required standards, as well as an annual payment for the upkeep and maintenance of the walks. The proposed scheme involves a payment of EUR 1,000, plus EUR 5 per metre. The payment would cover ongoing maintenance and would reward farmers for work to ensure the walks achieve the highest possible standard. The IFA scheme was endorsed by walking groups at the public launch of the scheme. The IFA has costed the scheme at about EUR 15 million when fully operational, covering about 30 walks and bringing them up to the standard of Waymarked Ways. This is far more modest than the wild estimates thrown about by Keep Ireland Open and other opponents in an attempt to denigrate a worthwhile initiative. Payments to farmers would cover the ongoing costs of maintenance as well as rewarding the farmer who gives his time to ensure that the walk is kept to the standards that are required. The IFA proposal would have the potential to create something in the order of 2,000km of linear and looped walks throughout the country. In relation to insurance, the IFA is satisfied that the Public Liability Act of 1995, as a general rule, fully protects landowners where people access their land. However, where walks are created and payment made, the local authority would be required to fully indemnify landowners. An opportunity now exists for the creation of such walks and through the IFA's involvement in Comhairle Na Tuaithe, the IFA has pushed this proposal. Ó Cuív has promised proposals since last November. In conclusion, farmers are prepared to play their part in the creation of walks through a scheme like the Countryside Walkways Management Scheme. Already farmers have shown that these walks can be created through consultation and a co-operative approach. Ruairí Quinn's Access to the Countryside Bill fails to take account of the goodwill that already exists and will not succeed because it is an infringement of property rights. Pádraig Walshe is president of the Irish Farmers' Association. A year or so ago I met a farmer who has a large farm in lowland Scotland. Recreational users there can legally walk anywhere now, except the most obvious places, such as across growing crops and close to dwellings. I asked him how he felt about this. He looked at me quizzically. ""It doesn't bother me,"" he said. ""It's the law of the land now and anyway walkers are no trouble."" This man is not paid a penny to allow access, any more than any other landowner is in Scotland, except in special circumstances. It's the same all over western Europe, where there is freedom to roam over economically marginal land and a network of rights of way in farmed country. The state usually pays for stiles, footbridges, signposting, etc, but little else. Walking tourism thrives, farmers can diversify into agri-tourism or work on infrastructure for walkers if they wish. There is little friction. It's win-win for farmers and walkers. But not in Ireland. Here walkers have no legal right to put a foot on to private land and the farming organisations intend to keep it that way unless they get a king's ransom. The IFA have proposed a scheme of breathtaking audacity. To allow permissive paths (a legally inferior type of right of way), they are demanding EUR 5,000 per kilometre plus EUR 1,000 per farm. Per year! So if Ireland is to have a comprehensive network of rights of way (say 80,000km compared to the 225,000km in England and Wales), it would cost the State EUR 400 million plus EUR 1,000 per farm, every year. And that's before the inventive minds in the IFA have considered freedom to roam, doubtless based on the number of square millimetres conceded. (Incidentally, please don't tell me of the farmers' generosity to date: only 14 per cent of Ireland's pathetically small network of 8,300km of waymarked routes is over private land.) The results of the farming organisations' greed are all too evident. Scotland and Ireland have broadly similar costs of living, surface areas and accessibility; though Scotland has a far greater mountain area, much of it is distant from roads. Yet Scotland has well over four times the walking tourism revenue of Ireland. The major cause of this huge discrepancy is, of course, access. Apart from an uncertain welcome, any informal rights we have can be withdrawn at any time: hence a paucity of stiles, signposts, guidebooks, and all the support that walkers rightly expect. Let me make Keep Ireland Open's policy perfectly clear. We do not aspire to the idyllic Scottish situation. Instead we are campaigning for freedom to roam over only the 7 per cent of the land in rough grazing and a modest network of rights of way in lowland areas. We are not looking for the right to walk into people's back garden, as farm representatives so tediously repeat. We are not asking that areas with persistent problems of vandalism be opened to the public. We are prepared to pay for car parking if the proceeds were to go to improving facilities for all recreational users. The facilities we are looking for are modest by international standards: they would just about revive hill-walking tourism and the requirements of an increasingly obese and ageing population, who want somewhere to walk other than frequently busy roads. The Labour Party's Access to the Countryside Bill 2007, which has attracted such a hysterical reaction from the farming organisations, admirably covers a major part of this issue. However, under no circumstances are we as walkers going to pay simply for access, nor do we think the Government should. We are not going to step so completely outside European precedent. It is time for farmers to get real. More than 70 per cent of their income, even more in the marginal areas of most interest to walkers, comes from the taxpayers of Europe and increasingly Ireland. It is time we got something back. The public has shown sympathy with farmers' problems to date. However, it will find it increasingly galling that farmers live in the most pleasant, stress-free parts of the country at the tax payers' expense, but they will not make even a minimal concession towards the public good or even the good of their own rural communities. As for the Government, it must reverse its discredited voluntary approach that has produced nothing but more extreme demands. Now is the time for a little stick and less carrot. The number of farmers is in long-term decline and the number of walkers is increasing. The Government should appeal over the heads of the farming organisations to the general public. It even has a powerful weapon to hand: the introduction of EU cross-compliance measures to tie farmers' grants to providing reasonable access. What is it waiting for? David Herman is a veteran Irish hill walker and is a leading member of Keep Ireland Open. online: join the debate @ www.ireland.com/head2head Last week, Dr Joe Barry and Michael Patton debated the question: Should alcohol advertising be banned? Here is an edited selection of some of your comments: A ban on advertising would be a clear way ""to fundamentally challenge our culture and attitudes to alcohol in certain parts of our society"", according to the argument against a ban. It needs to be made more clear that alcohol is a (legal) drug which causes even more harm than illegal drugs. Measures to restrict the promotion of this drug would send a signal to challenge the culture, irrespective of statistical outcomes. - John G Faris, Ireland I think we should introduce the same rules as the US: nobody under 21 is served drink. - Rita Morris, Ireland Some of the advertising campaigns for Diageo in particular embrace our culture and heritage. One of my favourites is the Guinness-sponsored GAA advert which brought back to life the epic tale of Cuchulain. Alcohol has always been a part of our games and our culture. Many of our icons are famed for drinking mead, others are famed for changing water into wine. Everything in life has positives and negatives; the delicate balance is only maintained when there is awareness of the negative aspects. Irresponsible drinking should be knocked because it hurts people; it should not be permitted that our games or social events be drenched in alcohol overdoses. Most of the alcohol companies seem to appreciate this and over recent years have sponsored drink awareness campaigns. These have much scope for development. Guinness is to the Galway Oyster Festival what bread is to butter. And what would the Galway races be without a few scoops of the black stuff? - Mary Davey, Ireland Advertising of alcohol needs to be banned. Alcohol is a huge part of Irish society, but much violence results from it and it also leads to addiction and sometimes death. Action needs to be taken to reduce consumption. Banning advertising will aid a reduction in alcohol consumption. With my age group of the mid-teens, it is illegal to drink alcohol, but the main reason we do so is because we see adults looking ""cool"" when drinking. As teenagers we want to act more grown-up and, with advertisements in place, we see alcohol as a way to be more adult-like, yet the reality is quite the opposite. - Ciarán Rogers, Ireland Stop the supply of cheap alcohol in our supermarkets and off-licences. It's a disgrace. - Kate Fitzpatrick, Ireland Restricting an industry is a big step to take but not excessive in this circumstance. It was interesting to see an industry representative claim (like the cigarette companies) that advertising does not increase overall consumption, merely brand selection. This is a hoary old cliche that never seems to be backed up by any research. Regardless of the advertising though, we are our own worst enemies. From the earliest age, we expose children, not only to advertising but to adults almost exclusively socialising with drink in hand. I like a drink, but even I can see this is inappropriate. - Tom Ennis, Ireland Using sport to promote drink is perverse. Alcohol attacks, first and foremost, muscle. Guinness advertisements may be clever, but at the end of the day their purpose is to promote drinking, despite all disclaimers. - Ronan O'Brien, Ireland It is fallacious to argue that alcohol is ""different"" because it is ""legal"". If it was invented tomorrow and subjected to the rigours of modern product safety testing, there is no way it would pass. - Duncan Martin, Ireland Advertising normalises drinking and its place in society - and excludes those who don't drink. The problems alcohol creates mean advertising should seek to cut, not to increase, consumption. - M Woods",0
The Irish Times,Apr-16,2012,"April 16, 2012",O'Neill lays out aims for the future,"NEW GAA president Liam O Neill took office on Saturday during the first annual congress of the association held in his native Laois. In his inaugural speech he outlined his three main areas of concern: the games, finance and infrastructure and the importance of recruiting new members. As someone with a serious track record in the area of discipline, as chair of the committee that devised the experimental rules of three years ago, O Neill unsurprisingly focused on those matters at the weekend and said that the establishment of a new working group is on his agenda.  Central to the playing of games and promotion of games is the specific area of refereeing and discipline. A number of years ago we initiated an in-depth review of the playing infraction penalty system and how we might devise and test a new penalty system with a view to improving discipline on the field and making our games more pleasurable to play and entertaining to watch.  It has been suggested to me that our games could now benefit from revisiting our system of penalties. I am considering establishing a new working group to take a fresh look at this and modify the original proposals to take into account good suggestions which have been advanced recently.  He also undertook to establish a refereeing recruitment drive and to look at simplifying playing rules on fouls. O Neill also promised zero tolerance for violence and criticised the association at large for an inability to accept discipline.  Let me state clearly that, as far as I am concerned, there is no acceptable level of violence. Indiscipline and violence cannot be accepted and will not be tolerated. It s not enough however to say it. Our rules and sanctions need to reflect just that and we need to rigidly apply those sanctions.  Unfortunately a significant percentage of our units and players have yet to learn to accept fair punishment, which after all is decided by their peers and is applied solely in the spirit of our agreed rules and for the greater good of our games.  O Neill also offered to place the administrative resources of Croke Park at the disposal of clubs struggling in the recession.  Finance, in these uncertain economic times, is an area of huge concern. I want all of our units to tell us what help they need with finance. Do you need help in budgeting? Do you need help with fundraising ideas and methods? Do you need help in the management of our accounts? If help is needed, help will be provided. Our new finance committee will act as a resource for counties, not just identifying difficulties but also suggesting solutions.  He also prioritised the recruitment of new members and the training of officers and said the association could learn from its overseas units. We will also, in relation to recruitment and expansion, engage with the GAA overseas: to learn from them and to ask questions of them. For example: how do they expand and recruit in places where the GAA has never been before?  I want us to be open enough to learn from them and bring their experiences acquired abroad back home. I want us then to bring our organisational abilities at home to bear on those experiences with a view to expanding this organisation so that everybody has a chance to be aware of, and participate in, our Gaelic games.  O Neill s predecessor Christy Cooney took his final bow at the congress and reflected on his three years in office during his valedictory address. He mentioned the amalgamation with the Gaelic Players Association in 2010 as an initiative that had left us on a stronger footing as a single national unit . Cooney also talked about the amateur status issue and the fallout from January s discussion document by director general Pádraic Duffy and warned that the preferred option of more rigorously enforcing the rule would be exercised. Our counties came back reaffirming their desire to have the amateur status as it currently exists upheld and we are moving to ensure that this happens . . . a compliance structure will put in place in the coming months.  He also recalled the visit to Croke Park last May by the Queen, saying that the occasion shone a global light on the GAA and on Croke Park in particular .",0
The Irish Times,Apr-16,2021,"April 16, 2021",US tax changes could cost Ireland more than pandemic,"When Ireland's low corporation tax strategy was conceived in the 1950s, it was aimed at stimulating growth at the expense of tax revenue.  Today it has, instead, been transformed into a huge source of tax revenue for the government, while it has a relatively minor role in driving employment growth. Karlin Lillington commented on this changed role in her column last week: there are now many more important reasons why multinationals employ large numbers of people in Ireland than the low corporation tax. Last year revenue from corporation tax amounted to about 6 per cent of national income, with about 80 per cent of it coming from foreign multinationals, and about half of the total from US companies.  This income is very important to Ireland, so that future changes in the international environment that seriously reduce our tax receipts could have a longer-lasting impact on the economy than the pandemic. The Irish corporation tax regime has caused friction with our international partners and friends since it began. The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1965 provided for it to be phased out over the early 1970s. However, membership of the EEC in 1973 superseded that agreement.  Our tax regime continues to attract adverse headlines. Recent years have seen a step-up in international pressures to reform the global corporation tax system. Looking at this drive for reform objectively, it has some significant merit, which will make it hard for Ireland to resist change.  The EU had suggested an alteration in how the tax liabilities are calculated based on where countries do business. That proposal has foundered, partly due to Irish opposition. OECD proposals Another set of proposals for reform is being developed by OECD, and this agenda is likely to be more successful than the EU platform. The OECD proposals would, among other things, provide for a minimum tax rate internationally.  They would also allow taxation of digital services companies based on where they do business, rather than where they are legally established. However, the Trump regime pulled out of the potential deal, which temporarily stymied change. What is different now is that the Biden regime is returning to the OECD negotiations, and is also planning a major change in its own corporation tax system to help fund a major infrastructure programme.  It is the change in the US approach which has the potential to make most difference to Irish tax revenue.  Tax legislation However, as of today, while we know that changes in US tax legislation could be very important for Ireland, we don't even know with certainty that they could lead to a loss in revenue.  Nevertheless, though acknowledging things remain uncertain, Wednesday's Stability Programme Update from the Department of Finance has built in an anticipated EUR 2 billion drop in tax revenue by 2025 as a possible result of the OECD process and the Biden tax changes. The fundamental factor in Ireland's burgeoning corporation tax revenues has been the unusual nature of US tax law.  While German and UK firms cannot move much of their profits offshore to reduce their tax liabilities, US companies have been able to do so for many years.  Apple and Microsoft The original justification for this approach was that it made US firms more competitive.  However, firms such as Apple and Microsoft don't need any such help.  The continuation of this loophole means that the US loses large tax revenues from these companies, some of which we get instead.  The Trump regime changed things by introducing a minimum rate of 10.5 per cent that US firms have to pay on foreign profits.  This helped shift a lot of profit to Ireland, because our rate was 12.5 per cent, which was deemed acceptable compared to a zero rate in some jurisdictions.  Thus, Trump's changes raised Irish tax revenue. The Biden regime is talking about raising the minimum rate to 21 per cent.  If no other changes were made, the Irish Government could potentially offer US companies the option of paying tax here at 21 per cent - massively raising tax revenues in Ireland, as US companies sought to avoid paying tax at an even higher rate in the US.  However, such an outcome seems too good to be true.  From a US perspective, it would make sense to require its companies to pay the US government a share of any minimum tax on foreign profits.  At worst, any such rules could mean that up to EUR 6 billion of the exceptional taxes Ireland currently collects from US companies might accrue instead to the US treasury.  That would constitute a huge hit for Ireland, and a minor gain for the US.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-18,2009,"April 18, 2009",Citigroup and GE results better than expected,"CITIGROUP AND General Electric (GE), two of the biggest corporate victims of the economic crisis, yesterday won some respite by reporting better-than-expected profits in the first three months of the year. However, the corporate giants failed to dispel market fears over their future at a time when the global economy and US consumer sector remain under severe strain. Citi heightened the uncertainty over the US government s stress tests of banks financial health by announcing a delay in the planned sale of a 36 per cent stake to the authorities until the results of the tests next month. Some investors read it as a sign that the company might need another bailout. Although GE is in better financial health than Citi, both com-panies were dogged by questions over their earnings, which were helped by one-off gains, and their ability to withstand further shocks to the global economy. In spite of reporting its first profit in six quarters net income of $1.6 billion (EUR 1.23 billion) analysts questioned Citi s results, highlighting the one-off gains that helped it to offset $5.4 billion in credit-related writedowns. Citi executives pointed to the strength of its investment bank, which had a stellar quarter driven by strong trading revenues, and said the company was on track to reduce costs and risk. At GE, earnings from continuing operations fell 35 per cent to $2.8 billion, or 26 US cents a share, but were ahead of expectations. The company reassured investors that GE Capital, its financial arm, would remain profitable this year in spite of an uncertain outlook for the credit markets.

The Irish Times,Apr-18,2009,"April 18, 2009",Troubled times in 'Land of Smiles',"Thailand is facing an increasingly uncertain future after the latest spate of street protests pushed the country to the brink of political and economic collapse, writes CLIFFORD COONANin Bangkok THE WINDOW OF the taxi turned suddenly grey as a group of giggling children threw a bucket of water mixed with talcum powder from the roadside, celebrating Thai New Year, or Songkran, in the traditional way. It s the hottest time of year, and a dousing with water is quite welcome given the 34-degree heat, and all along Silom Road in downtown Bangkok, people were soaked and happy. The water is said to wash away bad luck, and anyway the water pistols are a much happier option than the live rounds fired by soldiers during anti-government riots which killed two and injured 135 people. This year Bangkok residents were even more cheerful than usual, because the latest political crisis to damage the country was finally over, at least for the time being. These are troubled times in the Land of Smiles .  The trouble is very bad, very bad for Thailand. We need tourism, said one young man, his face caked with water and rice powder, another tradition at this time of celebration. With its balmy climate, beautiful beaches, great food and friendly people, Thailand is one of the world s greatest tourist destinations, hosting 14 million tourists last year, including many from Ireland. Thailand had barely recovered from the tsunami in 2004 when the political disorder began and the last five years have seen a series of protests and a coup which saw former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra ousted by the military. More recently, the tourism industry was slowly recovering after a one-week shutdown of Bangkok s airports by protesters opposed to Thaksin late last year a government run by his brother-in-law was in power when the protests again brought the attention of the world to bear on the bitter conflict that undermines what is one of Asia s most successful and stable democracies. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva is a good-looking, Oxford-educated economist, a fan of Britpop and English football, but who critics believe lacks a common touch. When he was appointed in December he became Thailand s third prime minister in as many months, and expectations were not very high that he would survive the crisis. The crisis had moments of high drama, and for a while it looked like the trouble on the streets of this city of 12 million could have developed into full-blown civil war. In a country that has seen 18 coups in the past six decades, there were also fears that the army might again be tempted to take control to restore order. At the ASEAN summit of Asian leaders in the beach town of Pattaya, protesters overwhelmed riot troops and stormed part of the conference venue. Some of the 15 visiting leaders had to be evacuated by helicopter. The debacle was hugely embarrassing for Abhisit, who had made great efforts to reassure his regional counterparts that everything would be fine for the meeting. At another point last week, about 50 protesters forced their way into the interior ministry with Abhisit inside. He escaped, but his secretary-general Niphon Phromphan was dragged from his car by red-shirted protesters and badly beaten. At the height of the protests, the boulevards around Government House were transformed into a war zone. At the Wang Daeng intersection, protesters threw stones and Molotov cocktails, and set buses on fire before propelling them at high speed into the ranks of riot police. THE RIOTS LEFT scores of people injured and two people from the Nang Loeng market district were killed when residents turned on the protesters. On one side in the conflict was the yellows . Last year, thousands of yellow-shirted protesters took to the streets, demanding the ousting of two successive governments led by allies of Thaksin. These demonstrators were made up mostly of business community leaders, former soldiers, supporters of the royal family and the urban middle class. They had also protested in 2005 and 2006, and their action ultimately triggered a seizure of power by the army. Even though they billed themselves as the People s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), they were actually seeking to control the appointment of a percentage of the country s parliamentarians because they believed the rural poor were not sufficiently educated to understand politics. Meanwhile, the red-shirted demonstrators, who call themselves the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), oppose Abhisit because they believe he took power illegally. The core support for the UDD, and for Thaksin, is among country people who benefited from a series of populist measures he introduced during his time in power, such as free health care. The red-shirt movement had momentum for a while. Luck Lekhanethet, a popular astrologer in Thailand, said at one rally by the UDD that Mr Abhisit s government would fail and he would have to dissolve parliament. In the end, the protests collapsed with incredible speed as the red leaders opted to stand down in the face of the overwhelming firepower of the security forces. The red-shirted supporters waved little plastic clapping hand toys and some of the women prostrated themselves in front of the soldiers, but the army stood firm behind Abhisit and were unmoved by the tears of frustration as the protesters passed through the checkpoints and headed for home.  Neither one of these groups should be seen as a model for opposing a government as in less than five months they have devastated the country, ran an editorial in the Bangkok Post. Speaking by videophone to his supporters at Government House, the exiled Thaksin called for a people s revolution and promised that he would lead the people in a popular uprising if there was a coup. In his appearances on international TV networks, he claimed that many people had died, an assertion which later proved to be false. Thaksin s big gamble that the red-shirts would take on the army, or that the army would fold, didn t pay off. He has now lost face because of this climbdown and because he has shown that he is prepared to support violence as a way of regaining power. Furthermore, there is speculation that he moved some of his assets, which include investments in telecoms and the media, out of the country before he was ousted by a military coup in 2006. Thaksin has won two elections, more than any other Thai leader, and by landslides. If elections were held tomorrow, he would probably win again, although the complicated system of coalitions in the parliament means that he would be unlikely to be able to form a government. His family is among the wealthiest in Thailand, and in 2004 the US magazine Forbes ranked Thaksin as the 16th richest man in Southeast Asia. Thaksin s passport has now been revoked and a warrant for his arrest has been issued. He is in exile since his conviction on corruption charges, and rumours were rife that he was in neighbouring Cambodia, waiting to return if the protests he masterminded were successful. Fund managers say that the cancellation of the ASEAN summit has damaged their confidence in the country, and foreigners are now expected to substantially reduce their holdings of Thai stocks and bonds. Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij said Thailand would spend more and borrow more to help give the economy a boost. He admitted that the unrest had done serious damage to the economy, which is now poised to contract by more than the three per cent already forecast.  We were already anticipating a shortfall in the current fiscal year and that shortfall is almost certainly going to be larger now because of what happened in the last 72 hours, he said after the crisis had eased.  The bigger challenge is how to stimulate investment in the medium term, he said. The rating agency Standard Poors downgraded its rating for Thailand because it believes political tension will remain high, whichever side was in power. ABHISIT HAS NOW promised to call elections once stability is restored, and this week the city was slowly coming back to normality after the riots.  What we are now trying to do is to make sure there is a complete restoration of law and order. We have to make sure that there are no further disruptions and rioting of any kind. We hope over the next few days to make sure that is achieved, he said. By the next day, most of the tuk-tuk taxis and cars had been washed clean, but the long-term damage done to Thailand s fragile democracy by the political unrest of recent weeks will not wash away so easily.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-18,2017,"April 18, 2017",Where have all our teachers gone?; A shortage of cover means children are at risk of being sent home from school or taught by unqualified staff,"Sunnier climes, the chance to save for a mortgage and a better quality of life are just some of the reasons newly qualified teachers are ditching casual work here in such large numbers.  Principals say it is becoming increasingly difficult to find substitute teachers to fill in on sick days at primary level. It means cramming children into other classes, while smaller schools face the threat of closing for the day. At second level, students are increasingly being taught by unqualified staff due to a major shortage of teachers in key subjects such as Irish, European languages and home economics, according to school management bodies (see panel). The Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) estimates that about 800 substitute teachers are needed to cover absences in the 3,300 primary schools across the country. Peter Mullan of the INTO says Irish teachers are in demand abroad and their reasons for leaving are multitude. A lack of regular work and difficulties securing permanent contracts mean being a substitute teacher is a tough existence. ""Teachers are thinking, Why would I stay in Ireland for the odd day here and there when I can get guaranteed work abroad?,"" says Mullan. Unequal pay levels for teachers qualified after 2012 also extends to daily substitute payment rates: teachers qualified before 2012 get EUR 177 per day while the latter get EUR 156 per day. Mullan says the Government needs to address housing policy and pay policy because young teachers ""are getting squeezed on the double"" with lower pay and higher living costs. ""We need the Government to deal with pay inequality for once and for all as it is causing a major problem. It's creating discontent and ill-feeling among newly qualified teachers. Young teachers can't get a fair wage in Ireland and are going elsewhere,"" he says. ""It's impossible to live and rent in Dublin if you are only getting subbing. You would need to be living at home because you couldn't pay the types of rent they are looking for in Dublin because of the uncertain work and irregular income.""  Education system This isn't, of course, a new issue, though it is growing more acute according to teachers and management bodies. They say that the quality of teaching is now at real risk at a time of ambitious Government policies aimed at ensuring Ireland becomes the best education system in Europe over the coming years. ""We had this situation about 15 years ago when hundreds of classes were being taught on a regular basis by people with no qualifications,"" says Mullan. ""They were the very classes that had a dip in the international literacy tests so this has to have an effect on academic standards if we can't get qualified teachers to sub. ""Anybody can go in for five days; you don't even need a degree. You literally need someone in a childcare position who can make sure they don't do damage to one another.""  This measure was only intended for short-term absences, he says, and was never a long-term solution. Joe Lyons, principal of St Joseph's Ballybrown National School in Limerick, says the problem of finding substitute teachers is perennial but has become increasingly acute due to emigration. It is a medium-sized school with 15 teachers. Two of the teachers are on maternity leave and one is about to go on leave, so it has an urgent need for substitutes or short-term cover. ""There was one Monday morning recently where we had four teachers out on sick leave and I couldn't get a sub for any one of the four. So we had to split a class, I had to teach a class and we had to get the learning support teachers to take a block each,"" he says. ""In September, schools get lots of subs but there are lots of Sunday nights where I have rang 30 or 40 teachers and none of them are available.  ""I tried the INTO sub search recently and put in a 10km radius and then 40 km and there was no substitute available within 40 km of Limerick on that day.""  Health and safety Lyons says having to split or cram several classes into one room is a health and safety issue and means students with special education needs get less attention. Teacher-student quotas mean classrooms are typically full . ""If you already have 30 pupils in a class and you add them on top, it's physically challenging to teach or to manage that many students as well as being a health and safety issue,"" he says. New regulations regarding Garda vetting of substitute teachers that came into force in July 2016 have compounded the problem. Lyons says he doesn't blame young teachers for seeking a better life abroad and that pay inequality needs to be addressed. ""We had a student teacher in here and he told me his plan is to get a permanent post here and then take off to Dubai, make a few bob so he can get the deposit for a house in Ireland, and come back,"" he says. ""The thinking among young teachers is you will not make enough money here to buy a house unless you go abroad."" Lyons says the Department of Education needs to reintroduce a panel of supply teachers that are available in an area for work. ""It's the way to go. Those teachers would have a year-long contract and would be available for regular work for schools in the area, rather than principals having to ring up 30-40 teachers on a Sunday night and then hearing that they're not available,"" he says.  Class sizes So what are principals to do when they need cover? The INTO's online subsearch facility has a list of teachers available for work in each area. There is also a ""text-a-sub"" service to which principals and teachers sign up. Despite these services, principals say it is sometimes impossible to find a trained teacher. Primary school teacher Kyna Rushe, who works in a large Dublin primary school, says the current subbing situation is leading to teachers in small schools not taking sick days because they don't have any staff to cover. ""In a two-teacher school or Gaeltacht school, that's what they have to do because they don't want to put the burden on their colleagues,"" Rushe says. ""As schools find it difficult to find substitute teachers to cover class teachers, this leaves the principal to split classes. Class sizes become 40-plus in some cases,"" she says. It means standards are at risk of slipping, which causes great difficulty for children with special educational needs . These children, especially if they have autism, find it difficult to focus in such a busy environment or where there is a change to their routine, says Rushe.  Against this backdrop, teaching abroad can be an enticing prospect. "" In places like Dubai they are offering free accommodation, setting-up costs and one flight home per year,"" she says.  ""Newly qualified teachers are not waiting around to see if the Department of Education sorts out the pay parity issue.""",1
The Irish Times,Apr-19,2019,"April 19, 2019",'They have left it too late for a positive outcome',"Ronan Higham is managing director of Belfast-based Pure Fitout. The shopfitting company, which employs 49 people, creates luxury interiors for bars, hotels, restaurants and retail through its in-house manufacturing facility of metal fabrication and joinery. What was your reaction when you heard the UK had voted to leave the EU?  Shock and concern. I was worried at the time that it would have a detrimental impact on us. I thought it left us high and dry but we have actually grown quite a bit since then. More than we thought we would.  How is your business likely to be affected? Nobody knows. It is all open because nobody is giving any certainty about how Brexit might impact borders or taxes. We can't predict the outcome in terms of border checks, commodity codes, insurance. We do work in the UK and the Republic and we don't know how it might be impacted. How much do you rely on exports or the supply of materials across the Border? A large percentage of our clients are in the Republic of Ireland so there are concerns about fluctuations in currency and the price of manufacturing materials we buy within the EU could rise.  When did you begin preparing for Brexit and what contingency plans have you put in place so far?  We started preparing in 2018. We have attended Invest NI and FSB [Federation of Small Business] seminars but there has been no clear definition. However, they have indicated the impact on strategic sourcing. We are trying to get as much information from our clients for planning projects. We have widened our supply chain.  We are probably doing a bit more work with UK companies. We have very transparent conversations with key stakeholders, clients, landlords, and everyone else we deal with. Are you examining new markets/suppliers and, if so, how practical is that? We are trying to get a bigger foothold into the UK market. We have a few projects now in London and are planning on doing a lot more. We have also expanded our supply chain into Germany and Spain but we are not sure how that will work when Brexit happens. Does Brexit present any opportunities for your business? It depends how it goes. We are in a Northern Ireland location. It could be fantastic for us. We have access to  the Republic of Ireland and Britain but that depends on the Border outcomes and tariffs. With the backstop it could end up a good thing. We try to see the bright side. When do you expect to be Brexit-ready? We are as ready as we can be given the ongoing uncertainty and given the limited information from the UK and Republic of Ireland governments. What's your best-/worst-case scenario? Best case is continuing to trade Ireland wide, and  Britain, without interruption, and continue to receive raw materials from EU and UK. Worst case is the UK and Ireland enter recession and that will stifle growth in our company. Are you stockpiling goods/raw materials? We have made a small increase in our stocks but we are not carrying huge amounts of stock. How might the Irish or British governments, or the EU, help ease the pain of Brexit for your company or sector? Ensure no hard border, reduce additional costs, no tax increases or any increased charges. It's so vague at present its awful. How do you think the Irish and UK governments have handled the Brexit negotiations? The UK poorly. They appear disorganised and unthoughtful to businesses and the economy. They have left it too late for a positive outcome.  The Irish are following the EU really, which is fair enough because they didn't ask to leave. Looking out five years, how do you think your business or industry will have changed as a result of Brexit? Uncertain, but we will keep adapting. Would you like to see a second referendum on Brexit? Yes, absolutely. The way the vote was handled and the lack of information about the way the country would end up after Brexit has been disastrous. The country needs to be properly informed. Even now at the late stage nobody is sure how this will end up. nIn conversation with Amanda Ferguson",1
The Irish Times,Apr-02,2011,"April 2, 2011",Cantillon,"Inside the world of business Tests mean Anglo avoids scrutiny  THE PUBLICATION of the results of the Central Bank s stress tests on Thursday means that a truly dismal set of results from Anglo Irish Bank did not get the scrutiny they perhaps deserved.  First up is chief executive Mike Aynsley s EUR 974,000 pay packet, which makes a mockery of the Government s EUR 500,000 cap. The inclusion in his package of eight air fares for his family in Australia to visit him sends out all the wrong signals. More worrying is the revelation that the bank paid EUR 62 million in fees to outside consultants for work on restructuring, assets transfers to the National Asset Management Agency and legacy matters . The Anglo carcass has provided a rich feast for the professional classes. A significant, but unquantified, portion of the EUR 62 million payment related to the preparation of four restructuring plans for Anglo Irish Bank, three of which had to be shelved because the European Union rejected them. This is an issue that is worthy of further ventilation. Did the commission keep changing the goalposts or were the first three plans just not much good? Either way, the bank does not seem to have been listening to the commission. Aynsley and his team have questions to answer because if there was any justification for hiring them at the sort of stratospheric salaries that they receive, it is because they know a thing or two about restructuring banks and dealing with bodies such as the commission. That the people who told us in no uncertain terms that anything other than their preferred option keeping Anglo going via a good bank/bad bank split was an act of folly remain in charge of the bank is curious. That they will earn massive salaries over the next 10 years to implement a plan that is the exact opposite of the one they said had no viable alternative is just plain mystifying. Failure once again appears to be being handsomely rewarded, which can only sustain public cynicism about the banks. Print industry monitors 'NY Times' web strategy THE EFFECTIVENESS of the paywall that the New York Timeshas thrown up around its online content this week will be closely watched by the rest of the newspaper industry. It is widely accepted that newspapers even major players like the New York Timeswhich generates annual revenues of more than $2 billion can no longer afford to give their product away for free online. Silicon Valley thinkers may opine about how free can be the basis of new web business models, but the collapse of the US newspaper industry in the face of web competition shows no publisher has figured out how to make free pay. It will be some months before the paywall s success can be judged, but the early signs are not encouraging. It has been widely reported that the newspaper spent $40-$50 million developing the technology to charge readers of its online newspaper. Technology analysts expressed surprise that the system needed to cost that much. The New York Timesis not simply putting all its articles behind the paywall. Casual readers will be able to get up to 20 articles a month for free but after that they will be asked to pay. New York Timesstories will also show up in search engine results and can be linked to and from social networks like Facebook and Twitter. This nuanced approach has enabled a Canadian software engineer to develop a free software program called NYT Clean, which enables people to access as many articles as they want for free. Less technical readers who pay the subscription face relatively steep fees of $15 $35 a month, depending on the package. That means the most loyal readers are the most likely to pay. As a result, the New York Timesrisks alienating its core audience if it becomes too easy for others to get in for free. The reality is not everyone will pay for news online. The New York Timesis trying to filter out those who will, but the stakes are high for the newspaper and the rest of the industry.

The Devonshire Arms, one of two large hotels in the town, is hard to miss: it s had its windows boarded up for months. The town has dozens more empty shopfronts, with dusty windows and peeling paintwork or to let signs, which used to host bustling toyshops, newsagents, supermarkets and pubs. For hundreds of years this seaside town was famous for its long, elegant main street. The clock tower and pretty 19th-century shopfronts made it one of the most photographed towns in the country. Today Main Street has an air of near-devastation. The commercial centre is in slow collapse, the result of a sharp downturn in trade and a jump in the popularity of large out-of-town retailers like Tesco. Over on the edge of town the deserted industrial estates point to another story of loss. Weeds obscure buildings that once provided manufacturing work for thousands of employees. Faded signs welcome visitors to company buildings, now hidden behind rusting, padlocked gates. It s an eerily quiet no-man s-land, almost like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie. All the town s big factories are now closed. Elba, Couristan Carpets, Technicolor Home Entertainment, Artesyn Technologies. They have all shut down over the past decade, leaving at least 2,000 people without jobs. The last employees in the only remaining factory, Tytex, a Danish medical-textiles manufacturer, were let go a year ago. The town s biggest employer is now St Raphael s, a former psychiatric hospital that became a care institution for people with intellectual disabilities. It employs 250 people.  If that ever closes you might as well put up two gates on either side of the town, says James Daly, a Siptu shop steward who dealt with the fallout of many of the company closures. To see husbands and wives losing their livelihoods, devastated and worrying about their homes and the future for their children, it s absolutely heart-wrenching.  Youghal s town centre is dying. Unemployment has soared with the closure of old industries, and the economic centre of the town is in danger of collapse. Young people are leaving in search of work elsewhere. Poor planning decisions at the height of the boom have also left it with unsightly and largely empty apartment blocks. The downward spiral of a town like Youghal is only a single tragedy in a much larger story. Crippling unemployment, financial insecurity and emigration are exacting a heavy toll on towns like it across the country. Statistics and indicators of economic growth or joblessness tell you only so much. They don t show the carnage that results from the collapse of industries, or the shattering experience of joblessness. Towns like Youghal are filled with the stories of people struggling to find work, or battling to hold on to it, of families under strain or torn apart by emigration, of generations-old family firms biting the dust. What is worse is that the decline of these communities isn t just explained by the sad and inevitable legacy of history. There is a sense of neglectful, or indeed deliberate, public policies by local and national government that squandered opportunities and laid the foundation for their decline. Yet there are also stories of hope, of new businesses setting up in the teeth of the recession, of jobless people retraining and carving out opportunities for themselves, and of towns rediscovering a resilience that few realised they had. The future of these towns is uncertain, though one thing is clear: with the Government s coffers empty, and increasing uncertainty about our ability to lure foreign investment, they will need to draw on their inner strengths to remake themselves and prosper once again. ANGELA HEHIR STILL finds it hard to drive past the empty shell of the factory where she spent some of her happiest years. I worked in Tytex there for 12½ years, says the 42-year-old, a mother of one. Everyone knew each other or socialised together. A lot of couples met there. There were neighbours and friends. It couldn t have been a happier set-up, really.  Tytex, which employed up to 150 people, said it was pulling out of Ireland because it couldn t afford the high labour costs; it relocated the factory to eastern Europe.  It s hit us very hard, says Hehir. Myself and my partner have been building a house, so how do you pay for that? There s no going out any more, no weekends away or holidays. It s worse for families where both parents were employed there . . . There s no work in this town none. Everyone is leaving to find work. The shops are closing left, right and centre.  Hehir says the social impact on Youghal has also been devastating. The pubs and cafes would be full. You d meet people in town. Now, for lots of people, it s a case of collect the dole and go home. They can t afford to go out. It s such a shame.  It s harder here because this is a town that s always had thriving industry. I d worked in the factory since I was 17. You could walk from one job to the next. Now, for the first time, I ve no prospect of employment. There s no other work: the shops aren t taking anyone on. You can commute, but that costs a lot of money. As I see it the town is literally closing down around us; it s becoming a ghost town. But no one seems to be doing anything about it.  She fears for the future of her child and for other young people in the area. Unemployment in the town is heading in the direction of 20 per cent, well above the national average of about 14.5 per cent. Young people leaving education are among those at highest risk of unemployment. Donal Daly is one a growing band of people commuting long distances from Youghal to find work. A mortgage broker, his work dried up with the property crash. Now he commutes to Limerick each day, making a round trip of about 250km. You ve got to go wherever there s work. The way I look at it I was lucky enough to find work there. I have to support my family: I have two children, he says.  It s incredible how things have gone backwards so quickly here over the past few years. There s been an air of apathy and negativity over the town. It s been totally neglected by governments and business leaders.  For an unfortunate few, commuting to work isn t even a consideration: instead they must focus on day-to-day survival. One local politician, who declines to be named, says grinding poverty is a reality in some households, where both parents are out of work and saddled with personal debt.  It s been shocking to see it during the election campaign, the local politician says. To see a family with no history of poverty now with only enough food on the table for two or three days a week, missing mortgage payments and relying on the Vincent de Paul, that was something I hadn t expected to ever see a return to. This is the reality of what s happening in some homes.  WHEN A TOWN loses between 2,000 and 2,500 manufacturing jobs in a few years the shock waves reverberate through the lives of former employees and shake the commercial heart of the town. Absolute Flowers is one of the few shops to have opened in recent times. Its co-owner Susan Spillane admits to being under severe pressure. It s all about survival, she says. There s no work around; the town is dead. There s nothing to keep anyone here. My own daughter has gone to Australia, and my youngest son is saying he can t stay here for much longer.  A few doors down the street are Seán Twomey and his 30-year-old son, Stephen, who run a butcher s shop. They, too, are struggling, but their frustration centres on the cost of commercial rates. We re hanging on by a thread, says Stephen. We re local and established, so we should be all right. We re just making enough to keep ticking over. But the rates are crippling us. We re getting no assistance from the council. It s killing the town. They re hounding people for parking here on top of everything else.  Farther along is a Supervalu run by Ken Brookes. He says he was forced to move the busy supermarket, which had been a linchpin for the town centre, out of its premises on the main street and closer to the periphery, to compete with Tesco and Lidl. If the closure of any business jolted Youghal it is that of the iconic Merricks. Once a fine department store, it housed nine sections over three large floors, selling everything from pins and needles to suites of furniture. After it was sold, 20 years ago, various businesses operated from the building; earlier this year the last retailer left. Gordon Good, who ran Merricks for 35 years, is saddened to see the enormous premises lying empty.  Its advantage for a town like this was that it was a meeting place for people as well as a large shop. People could come in and they didn t feel they had to buy anything. They would wander around, which was unusual in those days, when everything was bought over the counter. Now that it s closed it s very sad. It means that part of town is going to be dead unless someone comes along.  For people like Michael Farrell, a publican and member of the town s chamber of commerce, it s little surprise that the town is suffering visibly. If you factor in 2,000 job losses and the large numbers now commuting elsewhere for work, he estimates the town is losing between EUR 20 million and EUR 35 million a year. They are catastrophic losses for a town with a population of less than 10,000. There is another reason why the town centre is dying. Planning authorities allowed a large 24-hour Tesco and a Lidl on the edge of the town boundary; now they are sucking much of the commercial life away from the centre. It s a classic case of the doughnut effect , a term coined in the US to describe what happens when the commercial heart of an urban area is relocated to the suburbs, leaving a sometimes derelict or empty centre. Dr Kieran Keohane, a lecturer in sociology at University College Cork, says it s unusual to observe this phenomenon in an Irish context. The social impact is more than just the running down of a town centre: it also affects the social fabric that binds a community together. If we define a community by the density of the social networks, or people s contact with others, then the doughnut effect is more than just physical: it reduces people s contacts in the town; there is less occasion for people to meet or converse, for shared understanding.  IT CAN SEEM HARD to imagine now, but Youghal was one of the most important towns in medieval Ireland. In the 1400s it was the chief port on the island and, in these islands as a whole, second only to Bristol, in England. Just off Main Street are some echoes of its prosperous and influential past. The old defensive walls and almshouses are still intact, as are Elizabethan-era homes such as Myrtle Grove, where Sir Walter Raleigh reputedly smoked the first tobacco in Ireland. Alongside it is the first post-Norman college in the country, St Mary s, which was founded in 1464 as Our Lady s College of Yoghill; a papal bull referred to it as the university of the city of Youghal . By the 1700s visitors were flocking to the town. In the summer months great numbers resort to Youghall, for the benefit of the salt-water . . . With respect to amusements, the town is not without its share. Such as wish to dip in the news and politicks, can at all times be furnished with the public papers, by resorting to the Mall House, while billiards and backgammon afford ample entertainment to others, according to the Annals of Youghal, in 1784. Much later, mass tourism came to Youghal via the railway. Thousands descended each summer from Cork city and beyond. Old photographs show dense crowds gathered on railway platforms or swarming along the beaches. At the same time the town s carpet and weaving industries were creating thousands of jobs for the region. When those industries waned in the 1980s and 1990s they were replaced by high-tech manufacturing jobs with firms that made DVDs and power supplies. Ironically, the town s decline began in the middle of the boom. While other towns were bustling, the manufacturing industries here were beginning to relocate to Asia and eastern Europe, for their cheaper labour. Political leaders insisted that new multinationals with higher-skilled work would take their place. But none did. These days the scars of an economy in decline are plain to see, but some believe the town itself has been in denial. Michael Twomey, a history teacher and journalist, has been so moved by its decline that he has written and directed a documentary, Town Out of Time. It is a powerful testimony to the changes that have affected Youghal, and is born of anger and frustration. We had conversations for a long time about the state of Youghal, like everyone. But I began to feel that people were being anaesthetised by fatalism, he says. People here feel they have no control. So the film was born of the need to say the unsayable and to speak the unspeakable.  The picture it paints of Youghal is of a town suffering because of factory closures, the collapse of the town centre as an economic hub and poor planning decisions, such as the construction of big apartment blocks fuelled by seaside tax incentives. When Twomey organised a public screening in Youghal last December he and his colleague Kieran McCarthy, who shot the film, steeled themselves for criticism. No one, they reasoned, would welcome what they had done. The reaction was surprising in the end. There was frustration and there was embarrassment, but overall there was relief. People were glad that the sore had been opened up, says Twomey. My initial instinct was that people wouldn t want to watch it, but they did. People want to face up to where we re at. That, in itself, is a positive.  Locals also feel that the town s peripheral status it sits right by Co Cork s border with Co Waterford means it has been neglected by the local authorities. The town has only rarely had a representative in the Dáil: the election in February of Sandra McLellan, a local, as a Sinn Féin TD has given the area its first deputy since 1979.  We re caught in the middle of the two counties. We ve no real leadership. The bypass arrived a few years ago but the town itself had been bypassed long before, says James Daly, the Siptu shop steward. SO HOW DO YOU remake a crippled town and see it prosper? Perhaps you begin by defining the characteristics of the town that for centuries have made it an appealing place to live and then adopt strategies to bring them to life. The town is brimful of potential. It has five kilometres of white, sandy beaches; it is at the mouth of the Blackwater, possibly the most picturesque fishing river in the State, and is close to the cities of both Cork and Waterford. The town s heritage would be a far bigger draw for tourists were it better marketed. Few of our towns or cities have Youghal s kind of blood-spattered medieval history. A marina, which would be crucial to attracting tourists with money to spend, would give the town an immediate boost. Eoin Coyne, a 22-year-old Fianna Fáil town councillor, is keen to accentuate the potential of the area. Even though some of his family have been forced to emigrate, he says the town can, in time, become a thriving place for young people again. I certainly wouldn t lose all hope. It s our duty to lobby politicians in central government. We have great potential: we have fantastic facilities, ready-made factory buildings, a fantastically educated population, skilled tradesmen and women. This is a great place to do business: you have the population, the factories, we re close to Cork Airport, Ringaskiddy. It has huge potential: we need to highlight that.  In a historic building just off Main Street some of the town s residents are doing their best to carve a new future for themselves. Enterprise Youghal, based in the St Mary s College building, supports entrepreneurs looking to set up businesses by providing office space, broadband and telephone lines for affordable monthly rates. Some of the businesses being incubated at the centre, which is supported by the town council and other bodies, include an internet marketing firm, archaeology services and an IT company. Tom Connolly used to work for Apple. He now runs a project-management company from the centre, dealing with clients across Europe. He is also planning to expand into online sales of tailor-made crafts, such as musical instruments made from bone, similar to the spoons, used in traditional music. I ve everything I need here. Good broadband speeds, a supportive business environment. Our offices are also on the tourist trail around the town, which will help, he says. This downturn has taught us a sense of humility. You can t increase wealth by buying bits of the country from each other. I m an optimist, and if you can set up a business in this environment it augurs well for the future.  Most people here believe stronger local government is essential if the area is to realise its potential. The town council has few powers save setting rates and rezoning land. Cork County Council holds the real revenue-generating power. Its recent decision to paint the empty shopfronts on the town s main street in jaunty seaside colours, in the absence of more meaningful change, seemed to sum up its impotence in the face of the downturn. In the meantime local representatives end up being blamed for issues that are often, though not always, beyond their control. There have been calls for the railway line to Cork be reopened, but Irish Rail says the population is too small to make economic sense. With little sign of multinationals returning to Youghal, and little in the way of public funds to improve infrastructure, the town will have to rely on itself to pull through. David Fitzgibbon, one of the owners of Aherne s seafood restaurant and town house, is one of the reasons visitors go out of their way to visit Youghal. He remains defiantly upbeat about its prospects. This town has an awful lot going for it. We have the most beautiful river, the Blackwater, a lovely long beach, a historic town, renovated town walls, he says. We just need a little bit of help. We don t need the attitude of the town is dead . We really need something a bit more upbeat . . . Everyone s under pressure. You can either wallow in it and say, I m finished, or you can keep going and try your best.  Twomey and McCarthy s documentary about the town finishes at the old railway station near the sea, now overgrown and semi-derelict. It is a striking tableau. You can almost hear the echoes of the thousands of people milling around the platform or the clank and shudder of trains pulling in and out. But for the pair it is also a symbol of hope. Every town has its peaks of history. I think we re at a historical impasse now. Those good old days in the old photographs won t come back. We have to let go of that. Our film ends optimistically, I think, by looking outwards from the railway station towards a new future. There is something out there, but we have to go and find it. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-02,2020,"April 2, 2020",Tourism chiefs devising plan for another Gathering; Fáilte Ireland examining proposal to rerun 2013 event to boost sector after Covid-19," Fáilte Ireland, the State tourism authority, is developing a proposal for a rerun of the year-long Gathering series of events that rebooted tourism in 2013, as the sector warns revenues from overseas visitors may fall by 70 per cent. The Gathering was a series of more than 5,000 tourism events nationwide in 2013. It was aimed at the global Irish diaspora to attract them here for a holiday, as tourism was identified as a vehicle to drag the economy out of recession. It brought in an estimated EUR 170 million in 2013 and kicked off a seven-year expansion of the sector.  No decision The idea may now be revived, possibly for next year or the year after . No decision has yet been taken, but Fáilte Ireland has already established a group to examine it and other ideas, and preliminary findings will be presented to Ministers in two weeks. ""While our focus is very much on the present to ensure as many businesses as possible in the tourism sector survive this crisis, we are also exploring ideas that will help the industry to recover as quickly as possible at the appropriate time,"" said Paul Kelly, the agency's chief executive. ""One of these areas under consideration relates to The Gathering which took place in 2013."" The proposal was mentioned at the end of a conference call this week between industry leaders and Shane Ross, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Brendan Griffin, Minister of State for tourism. Also on the call were industry groups representing publicans, hoteliers, restaurateurs, coach and tour operators, and airports. It was agreed that Fáilte Ireland and also Tourism Ireland, which markets the country abroad, would present ideas to Ministers on another call with the industry in two weeks time. The proposal is being informally referred to as The Gathering part two, although it may not go on to use that name. In its recent election manifesto, Fine Gael proposed a Gathering-style event called The Year of the Invitation for 2023, the 10th anniversary of the original event. The timing of any initiative is uncertain, with many industry leaders believing 2021 is too early to put plans in place and market it properly abroad. Pat McCann, chief executive of Dalata Group, Ireland's biggest hotel operator, said he would be supportive of rerunning a diaspora-focused initiative like The Gathering, but the timing must be right: ""If you go out too soon on this it will waste money but if we get the timing right I think it could be very encouraging. A thing to remember is that Ireland will be seen as a safe country, as it always has, and that will be encouraging for visitors."" Irish Tourism Industry Confederation (Itic) chief executive Eoghan O'Mara Walsh, said the idea is interesting but it ""needs to be planned and developed fully before being launched"". Potential losses this year Itic will today give its members an estimate of potential losses this year, as the sector is savaged globally by Covid-19 shutdowns. Itic has calculated that last year's EUR 5.1 billion in revenues from overseas visitors could fall close to 70 per cent to EUR 1.58 billion. Assuming Covid-19 is brought under control soon, Itic estimates Irish tourism's revenues from overseas visitors are down 60 per cent in the first quarter of the year, 85 per cent in Q2, 70 per cent in Q3, and 50 per cent in Q4. ""The Government will need to have a support package for Ireland's tourism and hospitality industry in place for the rest of the year,"" said Mr O'Mara Walsh. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-20,2015,"April 20, 2015",Crying out for a mediator as Greece heads for default,"It is as hard to conjure up the right metaphor as it is to figure out why nobody outside Greece seems to be worried. The risk that the euro area is about to go up in flames is rising by the day. It is, perhaps, a little like the UK bond market in the days leading up to the outbreak of the first World War: until the guns actually started firing nobody involved in trading government debt seemed to notice that things were likely to get a little tricky.  Maybe it's perfectly rational to decide that, when risks can't be calculated with any degree of precision, it is only sensible to ignore them. If we can't measure something, it is pointless to try.  What is the chance of Greece leaving the euro? Before we even try to guess at an answer, it is important to correct an important belief that is widely held but utterly wrong: a Greek default on its debts is not the same thing as a Greek exit from the euro. Not even close.  One event may well follow the other but it is not automatic and will only happen a. if Europe's political elites make an explicit decision to boot the Greeks out following a debt default or b. the Greeks simply announce the reintroduction of the drachma. Written in the rules There is nothing written in the rules that means a Greek default must lead to exit from the euro.  All sorts of nasty things will happen after a default but it isn't necessarily the case that reinstating the drachma has to be one of them. It is easy to assess the risks of a Greek default. That's as close to certainty as it ever gets. We can be far less sure about the timing but the event is almost guaranteed: Greece will not pay back all that it owes.  The form of that default is also uncertain: it could be quick and cataclysmic or it could just be disguised in a perpetual game of extend and pretend. Cataclysmic for whom? One of the reasons why financial markets are not too concerned is that they have been reassured by virtually all the important actors that a Greek exit would just be a locally damaging affair. Only the Greeks are likely to get hurt. While it seems to me that it would be foolish in the extreme to test this assumption in combat, few others appear to be similarly worried.  Contrary to popular opinion, most legal systems are designed not to produce ""justice"" but rather a method to resolve disputes that would otherwise fester for eternity.  Most lawyers make the bulk of their money out of boundary disputes between neighbours. The courts are there to bring some kind of end to the process, one that stops short of open warfare.  The problem that Europe faces is that the argument between the Germans and the Greeks is one where there is truth on both sides, but there is no referee and no judicial process that even attempts to bring the dispute to a semi-civilised conclusion. Missing in action The only institution capable of acting as an impartial judge is the International Monetary Fund which, sadly, has gone missing in action. Some would say it has taken sides. It is striking that many IMF officials start penning deep and bitter critiques as soon as they leave the organisation. And they all say pretty much the same thing: the IMF has backed the wrong horse all through the financial crisis.  It is possible, just, to spot some internal recognition of this: buried in its latest World Economic Outlook there are glimpses of the odd mea culpa by serving, as opposed to ex, IMF staffers.  A dispute about much, much more than a garden fence, where both sides have a point, needs a mechanism to bring closure. Without a resolution process a crisis is likely. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is all going to end badly.  It would be foolish to try and be more precise than this. But there is, already, one lesson (at least) to be learned. No matter what we think about truth, justice or austerity, electing a government to pick a fight with Berlin and Brussels is an exercise in painful futility. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-20,2018,"April 20, 2018",State vulnerable to tightening of profit-shifting by US giants,"Since the late 1950s, the low Irish rate of corporation tax has played a key role in the successful development of the Irish economy through attracting foreign investment. However, it has long been clear that, as well as attracting real jobs to Ireland, the low rate has been used by foreign firms to reduce their global tax bill. This issue has attracted a lot of negative comment from fellow European Union members. While, in principle, individual countries may intend to prevent firms reducing their global tax bills through moving their profits between countries, designing tax rules that achieve that isn't easy. Profit-shifting is particularly difficult to police in a global economy with complicated supply chains, where parts of a production process take place in many different locations. For example, if a firm has crankshafts for cars made by a subsidiary in country A, which are then assembled into engines in a subsidiary in country B, and then built into cars in country C, it can be very difficult for tax authorities to assign the overall profit on the cars to a particular location.  By charging a high price for the engines, much of the profit could be allocated to the country where the engines were made. The company could argue that their special skill (and intellectual property) is in making good engines, a difficult issue for tax authorities to contest. This process has become even more complex as the value of intellectual property (IP) in some industries has increased. In particular, we have seen how ownership of the IP in the information technology industry can be moved from country to country.  Clearly the IP is exceptionally valuable in such industries and is responsible for much of the profit. However, it is proving difficult for tax authorities to police where the ownership of this IP resides. One indicator of the extent to which profits are shifted is company profitability in different locations. Eurostat publishes data for Ireland on the gross profits and the value added of companies by their country of ownership. For firms located in Ireland, the data shows considerable differences according to the country of ownership of the firms. Profitability  Between 2012 and 2016, the average gross profit rate for Irish-owned companies was about 40 per cent. For subsidiaries of UK companies that operated in Ireland the profit rate was not very different at 45 per cent of value added. This is not surprising as UK tax regulations have never facilitated profit-shifting to Ireland.  For German companies the profit rate was about 50 per cent, consistent with very limited shifting of profits to Ireland. The rate for French companies was slightly higher at about 55 per cent.  Of course, the profitability of firms varies across time and sectors. One would expect that companies that are expanding their operations internationally would tend to be more profitable than firms that don't have such opportunities. This could account for some of the higher observed profit rates for EU companies operating in Ireland. Even so, the data suggests that, for companies based in the EU, the tax laws in individual countries did not facilitate major shifting of profits to Ireland to take advantage of the low corporation tax rate. This runs counter to public perception among many of our EU partners. The situation is dramatically different for US subsidiaries operating in Ireland. Between 2012 and 2015 their average gross profit rate was 90 per cent of value added, as against 40 per cent for Irish-owned companies and up to 50 per cent for EU companies in general. Clearly there is very substantial shifting by US companies of their profits on global operations to their Irish subsidiaries. Relocations of firms to Ireland in 2015 raised the profit rate for US companies in that year to almost 95 per cent. The exceptional profitability of US companies in Ireland reflects US tax law and how it is implemented by the US administration. If the US tax law was similar to that of most EU countries, much of US multinationals' profits, now attributed to Ireland, would be treated as arising in the US, where the tax would be paid.  A high proportion of the EUR 8 billion a year paid in corporation tax in Ireland comes from US companies. This revenue stream is vulnerable to changes in either US or EU tax rules, and could fall dramatically in response to such changes. While we do not know if or when such tax changes could occur, it is prudent to regard this is an uncertain and possibly temporary source of income in budgetary planning.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-20,2019,"April 20, 2019","POWER PLAY WHEN POP AND POLITICS COLLIDE; Popular music is an artform attuned to the present moment, and every era's music reflects the mood of its time. But what happens when pop musicians are confronted with political and social turmoil?","What does a nation in crisis sound like? It's a pertinent question for our uncertain times, which has of late been occupying Bob Stanley. For Stanley, an author and member of electro-pop group Saint Etienne, it's not political speeches or protest chants, but rather the popular music produced in times of difficulty. Either way, he found his answer in his homeland of Britain. Though wracked by political instability, haunted by supply shortages, vexed by the Northern Ireland border and deeply divided on Europe, it's a Britain that also boasts a vibrant pop culture making vital music, which Stanley and his bandmate Pete Wiggs have compiled on a fascinating new album. By turns resigned, defiant and escapist in tone, the compilation captures what Stanley calls ""the grain of the era"". The era in question is not contemporary Britain, however. Three Day Week: When the Lights Went Out, 1972-1975, covers another tumultuous period, when industrial unrest, oil shocks, European debates and the Troubles fuelled uncertainty and decline. Three Day Week - the title refers to the British government's 1974 electricity conservation measure - attempts to reflect the atmosphere then.  ""It just sounds like the era to me, it's partly how I remember it,"" says Stanley, whose 2013 pop history Yeah Yeah Yeah attests to his encyclopedic musical knowledge. ""Very few of the tracks are directly political. But there's the feeling of things being rationed - electricity actually was being rationed, instruments were hard to come by. The music sounds like it was made during wartime."" It's a timely compilation, whose parallels with contemporary events are obvious. (The album's release was timed to coincide with the original Brexit date.) It raises a wider question too, of how pop music, an artform so attuned to the present, deals with political and social turmoil. It's a subject with particular resonance in a country with as turbulent a recent past as Ireland's. Confronted with turmoil or decline, how do musicians react? In the 1970s, British musicians were in downbeat mood, if Three Day Week is anything to go by. Although remembered as a decade of garishly OTT fashion and music, a different picture emerges here. So The Kinks and Strawbs mix jaunty tunes with a sour fatalism, while melancholy suffuses songs by Adam Faith and The Sutherland Brothers Band. The disillusion of the counterculture is evident on tracks by Hawkwind and The Edgar Broughton Band. The Troubles are even acknowledged, as on Phil Cordell's ostensibly apolitical Londonderry. But helped by glam-inflected bangers by The Troggs, Cockney Rebel and Stud Leather, Three Day Week takes the listener on a compelling journey through the lesser- spotted pop moments of 1970s Britain.  ""Pop music for me is always most interesting when you've got this mix, the overtly commercial but also this strangeness or artistic pretension sneaking in,"" says Stanley. ""The idea that Adam Faith or The Troggs sum up the era more succinctly than (progressive rock giants) Yes or Genesis."" It's not the first time Stanley and Wiggs have taken this approach. They've overseen the similarly remarkable compilations Paris in the Spring and State of the Union, which showcase the changing music that emerged from France and the US in the aftermath of the upheavals of 1968. ""I try to look at familiar artists in a new way, and as a way of exploring an era that everyone thinks they know inside out,"" says Stanley.  Of course, it's just one way of looking at the past half-century of events, even musically. But at a time when historical narrative is diversifying and consensus fracturing, the accessible medium of pop provides unexpected yet illuminating insights into the past. Plus you can hum along to them. A broader outlook  In Ireland, popular music hasn't always been in tune with its environment. True, the sentimental yet stoical country and western of Ray Lynam, Philomena Begley and the late Big Tom McBride chimed with squeezed rural audiences in the 1970s, while the folk scene could be a political bush telegraph. But the rock music of Thin Lizzy and Rory Gallagher was more apolitical and escapist in attitude and outlook.  The advent of punk, with its energy and outrage, led to a different approach. Paul Cleary was inspired by the movement's DIY rawness to form his band The Blades, but it also helped shape a broader outlook. ""With The Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Jam, it was a bit of a mish-mash of ideas, but they were all pretty much well-meaning,"" Cleary recalls. ""I had no real idea of what I wanted, but I knew what was wrong and why I had a chip on my shoulder."" He wasn't the only one. More pop-rock than punk, The Boomtown Rats scored a string of UK hits before singer Bob Geldof trained a sardonic eye on Ireland in the 1980 single Banana Republic, deriding the hypocrisy he saw back home. Equally disaffected but more elegiac was The Radiators' album Ghostown, which painted a mournful portrait of 1970s Dublin through a prism of myth and nostalgia. Both bands had left Ireland by then, however. Those who stayed behind didn't always pay attention to the economic decline around them, even as Irish rock music enjoyed an illusory boom in the wake of U2's success. U2 themselves were alive to injustice, as songs such as Pride underline, but preferred vague motivational positivity when it came to their home. ""I believe in the bells of Christchurch/Ringing for this land,"" sang Bono on A Celebration in 1982, as the country sank into depression. Other Irish musicians were more agitated. ""How it became political, was that I got frustrated hearing people pretending they were street-level,"" says Cleary. ""It dawned on us that we were the real deal."" Rather than resort to sloganeering, Cleary mixed kitchen-sink realism with a pop-punk sensibility. ""The political is always very personal,"" he says. The Blades' 1982 single The Bride Wore White dealt with teenage pregnancy and marriage, though its implicit target was ""the repression of the Catholic church"", while 1983's soul-influenced Downmarket used an everyday vignette of a bus stop to capture the atmosphere of stagnation. ""On a superficial level, it's mundane and prosaic, but it's meant to be like that,"" says Cleary. ""It's a day in the life of a nobody, which I was and am. People maybe take too much out of it, or not enough, but that's what a good song should do."" Certainly, few tracks better evoke the grit and greyness of urban Ireland then. Such street-level awareness collided with the amorphous aspirations of the Irish music mainstream, when U2 headlined Self-Aid, the 1986 benefit concert in aid of the unemployed. ""The whole thing was just so badly thought out,"" Cleary says. ""With something so intrinsically involved with government as unemployment, it just didn't sit with me at all."" Cleary is more forgiving now - ""I think U2 felt obliged to take part"" - but Self-Aid now seems tin-eared and paternalistic, a cautionary example of what happens when pop wears its social conscience too earnestly. Stardom didn't preclude engagement, however. When Sinead O'Connor became a global star with her 1990 single Nothing Compares 2U, everything about her was a rejection of the mores then still prevalent in Ireland. Much of this was down to O'Connor's personality, as when she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II on television. But her hit The Emperor's New Clothes was an unflinchingly honest and defiant account of being a single mother in a country where women had little autonomy over their bodies, with contraception, divorce and abortion all banned. That such a strong lyric was delivered over a slick dance-pop production only heightened its impact.  Atrocities and division Throughout all this time, the Troubles loomed. Stanley's anthology highlights how the northern situation crept into British music in the 1970s, with references to the IRA on Mike McGear's misanthropic track Kill. Bigger British stars dealt with the issue too, with John Lennon singing Sunday Bloody Sunday and Paul McCartney (McGear's older brother) urging Give Ireland Back to the Irish.  As the violence intensified, such sentiments sounded naïve. Again, the snarling DIY ethic of punk gave voice to those on the ground. As the Belfast punk scene provided a haven for disaffected youths from across sectarian lines, local band Stiff Little Fingers decried the atrocities and division around them on exhilarating tracks like Alternative Ulster and Suspect Device.  Equally notable, however, was the reaction of The Undertones to the conflict. Despite coming from the republican heartland of the Bogside in Derry, the band made their name with melodic pop-punk songs of adolescent longing, such as their classic, Teenage Kicks. ""We didn't want to sing about the Troubles, we wanted to escape from it, because we were living it every day,"" recalls Damian O'Neill, the band's guitarist. ""We didn't even think of writing anything, the way Stiff Little Fingers were doing. We just loved the pop sensibility thing."" O'Neill admits the band members had ""strong views"", but ""we were nervous that if we did do a song, it had to be really clever, not po-faced, but subtle."" When they eventually addressed the subject, it was in oblique manner. Released during the hunger strikes in 1981, It's Going to Happen made no direct reference to the ongoing strife, though lyrics like ""stupid revenge is what's making you stay"" didn't need much decoding. With its tough brass section and insistent chorus, it was a hit that also encapsulated the tension of the period.  O'Neill would go on to form That Petrol Emotion, who took a more explicitly political stance while still making danceable music. But The Undertones, who still tour today, show how to balance pop nous with wider engagement during difficult times. By contrast, U2 took a typically epic approach when they sang about the Troubles on Sunday Bloody Sunday. Anthemically sincere though the song is, it now sounds portentous and self-conscious, saying more about Bono's instincts than the reality of the situation.  With the arrival of the Celtic Tiger in the Republic and the peace process in the North, such urgency largely dissipated. Northern acts such as The Divine Comedy and Ash made peerless pop records infused by louche irony and punky exuberance respectively, as though relieved by the changed landscape. Meanwhile, it's no coincidence that the boom years coincided with the rise of Louis Walsh's hugely successful boy bands Boyzone and Westlife. Walsh's commercially astute, suffocatingly bland chart fodder seems a perfect metaphor for the compulsive consumerism that gripped the country. Then came the 2008 crash. Much like the financial fallout, the musical consequences are ongoing but often hard to discern. The confessional honesty of Conor O'Brien's act Villagers seems apposite at a time as conventional politics give way to issues of identity, gender and culture. But there are still artists who have captured the texture of contemporary Ireland, from the vernacular narratives of Lisa O'Neill to the multicultural hip-hop of Rusangano Family. But while musicians clearly remain plugged into society, it's harder for their music to seep into mass consciousness. ""The problem generally is that pop doesn't have the same seat at the table that it used to have culturally, it's just not as significant,"" says Stanley. But all is not lost. Pop music can still be vital and relevant. Stanley cites Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, arguably the world's biggest pop stars, as ""amazing role models"" whose recent albums have made a serious cultural impact.  Maybe it's only in hindsight that we can discern the songs that truly capture times of discontent and uncertainty. Pop is made for the here and now: perhaps only time can sort the wheat from the chaff, or The Troggs from Genesis. ""I don't know if there's an equivalent now, but I'm sure there's music being made that reflects the Brexit mood now,"" says Stanley. ""It's always easier to spot these things in retrospect. Maybe in 15 years someone will put a compilation together."" Three Day Week: When the Lights Went Out, 1972-1975 is  on Ace Records",0
The Irish Times,Apr-21,2008,"April 21, 2008",Do we cling to totems of past or build a better future?,"In a rapidly changing world, the West must embrace radical new power structures, writes Tony Kinsella. IN TIMES of change the familiar acquires particular importance as comforting symbols, totems to grasp. The tightness of the grip on the totem, be it rosary beads or pint glasses, matters more than its inherent value.   The Mayan civilisation of Central America, famous for its pyramids, prospered for more than 2,000 years only to crumble in less than 200. Its stability depended on its agriculture, and in Mayan culture the success of its farmers depended on sacrifices to the gods. Mayan society went into decline as crops began to fail due to climate change. The totem-clinging Mayan priests redoubled their human sacrifices, with the success you might expect. About 1,200 years ago the Mayan civilisation collapsed. Our early 21st century society faces challenges every bit as transformational, though hopefully not as cataclysmic, as the Mayan ones. A crucial totemic struggle is under way in Pennsylvania. Barack Obama described the economic realities of ""small towns in Pennsylvania . . . the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them . . . [ Voters] get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them."" In the Pennsylvania rust belt of shrinking industries and closed mines, Barack Obama's analysis was that people had lost faith in the political process to address, much less change, their daily realities, and that they displaced their anxieties towards totemic ""values"" issues. Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg first described this trend in their book The Real Majority (1970) which argued that US working-class voters went Republican when they voted on ""values"" rather than economics. Hillary Clinton's counterattack revealed more than her ability to scent blood. It showed her continuing faith in the political approach championed by her former campaign strategist, Mark Penn. This approach denies, Thatcher-like, the existence of society. Since voters lack common interests, a candidate must ""dice and slice"" their appeal, drinking whiskey with steelworkers, altar wine with Catholics, and mineral water with software designers - all in the same evening. The results of Pennsylvania's primary will speak volumes as to whether Democratic voters opt for a future with Obama as their pilot to help steer them and their country through uncharted waters, or for a more familiar, almost regressive, status quo with Senator Clinton. Italian voters hedged their bets last week, clinging to the familiar while laying the basis of a new departure. Silvio Berlusconi's third ruling passage in Rome might just reveal hitherto hidden abilities - although US writer Erica Jong cuttingly described him as ""a clown"". A clown he may well be, but he is a familiar one, offering many Italians a link with what they view as a better past, rather than a blueprint for the future. The relative success of Walter Veltroni's new Democratic Party, laying the basis for solid alternating governments in Rome, indicates that enough Italians are prepared to invest in a less flamboyant figure, to help guide their peninsula into an uncertain future. We are daily assailed with glimpses of our common, planetary challenges from spiralling food and energy prices to melting permafrost. Europe, or European-inspired countries and cultures, have dominated our world for at least five centuries. The notion that Christopher Columbus ""discovered"" the Americas in 1492 neatly avoids the reality of the millions who already lived there, and reinforces our Euro-centric view of the planet. World powers from Columbus's Spain, through the rise and fall of England, the Netherlands, the Hapsburg empire, France, Russia, Prussia and eventually the United States of America, shared two common realities. The first was that their peoples were predominantly white, the second that some variant of Christianity provided part of the cement that held their societies together. The economic and industrial centre of our planet is moving to Asia, with China and India playing central roles. The peoples of these countries are clearly not white, and while the Hindu religion fulfils a certain national role in India, the 3,500-year-old Chinese polity has never depended on a religion to provide its social cement. An almost subconscious fear of Chinese power may go some way towards explaining the intensity of protest that caught authorities unawares as the Olympic flame staggered around the world. The US is in recession - a reality which would traditionally drag European economies down in its wake. Although European growth forecasts for 2008 have been halved, the European economy continues to grow - fuelled by Chinese, Indian, Latin American and even African performances. US public deficits are largely financed by China, and the sovereign funds of oil exporting nations, buying US Treasury bonds. Yet the US dominates global financial structures such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Banking systems dominated by their most profligate borrowers are not renowned for their longevity. The World Trade Organisation has yet to adapt its structures and processes to reflect the economic power of India, China or Brazil. There is no global body responsible for agricultural policy and trade on a planet where food production has become a question of stability and survival. The UN Security Council's permanent members remain the victorious powers of 1945, jealously clinging to their thrones while excluding any permanent Indian, Japanese, Latin American or African presence. All these bodies must change, and new ones will be required. Europeans, if they act collectively through the EU, can play an important role. So too can a US led by a president capable of imagining the country as an important global player rather than the planetary master. Pennsylvanians get to choose between clinging tightly to totems of the past, or trying to build a better future tomorrow. Our chance comes on June 12th.'An almost subconscious fear of Chinese power may help to explain the intensity of protest",0
The Irish Times,Apr-21,2018,"April 21, 2018",Hanging by a thread: fascinating tales from Ireland's borderlands,"Ireland's Border is getting a lot of attention. This quiet corridor of fields, streams and bogs is vital in shaping the way the UK makes its exit from the EU. In Ireland, the potential impact on the Border was a subject of worry before the vote happened but it took months for the realisation to hit Westminster.  Discussion often frames the Border and its people as forgotten, ignored, voiceless. ""We're in the backseat of a rollercoaster,"" one Border resident told the BBC recently. Now voices are emerging, although it is unclear if these frontline reports reach the right people. There have been books, many documentaries, reams of journalism, and the Border even has its own popular Twitter platform. Darach MacDonald's new book Hard Border is a fine addition to the discussion and is likely to outlast most contributions as it is primarily a historical tour, particularly of the 1920s and the Troubles. It puts Brexit in context. To write it, MacDonald walked the 50-mile route of the now dried-up Ulster Canal. This waterway once linked Lough Neagh to the Erne system but was unsuccessful and closed in 1932, beaten by the railway and partition. It is a route that is only sometimes on the borderline but is certainly borderland and spends roughly equal time each side of the line. I think it is an appropriate place to discuss partition for another reason: the abandoned canal is a monument to big plans that didn't work out, imbued with the sense of economic decline that clung to much of Ireland's Border. Now there is talk of restoring the locks and reflooding the canal. This would be a wonderful link across the island, meaning you could boat from Waterford to Belfast. So Hard Border is a guided tour along a route that once was and may be again. In the meantime, MacDonald sticks to the canal route as much as possible, and when he can't he makes do with walking the nearest road. It can be pleasing to use Google Street View to illustrate the book. MacDonald marks his progress clearly, often naming townlands or route numbers. Unfortunately it would not be so easy to create your own index and none is supplied; Hard Border deserves one.   Sectarian attitudes MacDonald gets fascinating stories from court records and  newspaper archives. He draws together much detail on an episode from just before partition, a 1920 boycott of Belfast businesses that found most adherents in Monaghan. Whatever the intention, the boycott appeared to be a sectarian action and led to intimidation and attacks on Protestant-owned businesses. The important role of Protestant traders in the town was shaken, and many moved north across the soon-to-be Border.  MacDonald is anxious about the potential damage of Brexit. Indeed these fears are the reason for examining the Border's history now, but this boycott shows that sectarian attitudes are the real enemy, more dangerous than any customs post. MacDonald comments that the final cost of the boycott was the ""psychological separation of Monaghan from its traditional and natural centre, even before customs tariffs were imposed"". However, he might say, and I would agree, that a rehardened Border may help reawaken sectarianism - the dangers are interlinked.  MacDonald also opens up the sometimes violent few years between the provisional agreement of partition and the solidification of the frontier. It was an uncertain time, rather like today. Some Brexiteers dismiss responsibility for Ireland's Border by saying is it is the EU, not the UK, who will put customs posts in place. Likewise in 1923 James Craig, Northern Ireland's first prime minister, told Belfast business people that, ""partition was nothing; there was no such thing as partition if they [Dublin] did not erect a customs barrier between North and South."" This was exactly what Dublin went on to do, putting the new northern state firmly inside a British customs union. It seems tapping the Border as a revenue stream was irresistible to the Dublin government, even though it had the effect of strengthening partition. ""Craig could hardly believe his luck,"" says MacDonald.  Hard Border deals mostly with politics and conflict centring on familiar belligerents. Many pages feature the IRA or another armed acronym, the Orange Order, the B-Specials or political parties. I was just as interested in other stories that MacDonald's trek unearths. I had never heard of the 1919 strike at Monaghan Lunatic Asylum. The staff and inmates took over the building, hoisted a red flag over the roof and declared it a Soviet. This was under the leadership of the revolutionary socialist and writer Peadar O'Donnell, union organiser in the town at the time. They won improvement to their conditions and held a celebratory dance.  MacDonald is from Clones and still lives near the Border. Years of personal experience and a career in journalism bolsters the research. It is always very engaging when historical narratives arrive within the reach of his personal recall. He devotes a couple of pages to the Leslies of Glaslough, a family no Border writer can resist. MacDonald crashed one of their parties when he was 20. ""That bacchanalian event left a lasting impression on my ideas of what the gentry did when we weren't looking. Indeed, the Leslies tended to do it when we were looking.""  The chapter on his hometown is a particularly fine blend of history and memoir. Clones was one of the biggest losers in Ireland's partition, the abandonment of the Ulster Canal just one aspect of its isolation. MacDonald fears all the positives brought to Clones by the open Border will soon be taken away. ""The town and its people now hang by a thread under the threat of Brexit."" It is a concern that easily extends to the whole borderland. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-22,2014,"April 22, 2014",Scotland s uncertain vote,"With just five months to go until Scotland's referendum on independence, the Yes side has gained ground but still falls significantly short of a majority in the opinion polls, while the No side is troubled by self-doubt as to whether it can maintain its lead. By this stage all the principal political players and interest groups have declared their hands, most in favour of staying in the United Kingdom, but many voters remain undecided. So a great deal will depend on which side mounts the most effective campaign between now and September 18th. On that basis the momentum currently favours the Yes side. Their leaders have made the more coherent and passionate case for independence as an empowering choice for Scotland in the face of major criticisms questioning its economic, security and welfare viability. Their organisations are much more powerful and visible on the ground and appear to have a clearer strategy to win over undecided voters. They acknowledge the risks of independence but argue these are outweighed by the opportunities. And they have a growing appeal to voters who want more powers devolved to Scotland but fear this would not happen if independence is rejected. The case for Scotland to stay in the UK has been devolved to the Better Together alliance of the Conservative, Labour and the Liberal Democrats led by the Labour politician Alasdair Darling. He has concentrated on methodically rebutting the arguments of the Yes side with powerful support from peak industrial, financial and other business interests. But his style is dry and cerebral and the alliance is suffering a crisis of morale expressed in dissatisfaction with his performance and partisan arguments about strategy and objectives in the Conservative and Labour parties. The Conservatives have little support in Scotland and their Eurosceptic wing concentrates more on winning the case on EU membership than on Scotland.  Labour too faces problems as the main party defending the union. Its Scottish leaders are consistently outplayed by Alex Salmond's political skills and rhetorical brilliance as head of the Scottish government and Labour's main opponent there. They are divided on whether deeper devolution after a No vote would benefit Scotland but weaken their own party's political base in the UK as a whole. This means key groups of Labour supporters could swing to the Yes side in what has become a key factor in the referendum's political arithmetic.A great deal is at stake in this debate for the UK's internal and external futures. Scottish independence would throw the remaining union into doubt, particularly for unionists in the North. And even if independence is rejected this time political change in the UK would probably keep it on the agenda for years to come. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-23,2016,"April 23, 2016",Greeks urged to make contingency plan; No writedown on the cards as eurogroup meets next week to finish bailout review," Discussions on new debt relief measures for Greece will begin as early as next Thursday, as lenders near agreement on the first review of the Greek bailout after months of delay. A special eurogroup meeting has been provisionally scheduled for Thursday in Brussels, at which lenders will consider debt relief measures for Greece, nine months after the country's third bailout was agreed.  Euro zone finance ministers agreed that, for the latest bailout review to be completed, Greece would have to present a series of contingency measures equalling 2 per cent of GDP which would be triggered if Athens misses its targets in 2018. This would be in addition to a set of reforms already agreed.  Debt relief  While eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said no nominal debt writedown for Greece would be sanctioned, other relief measures would be explored, including debt reprofiling, maturity extensions and grace periods.  The IMF and Greece's EU lenders have been deeply divided about the question of debt relief since the agreement of an EUR 86 billion bailout last July.  The Washington-based fund has demanded debt relief as a precondition for its involvement in the third bailout. However, a number of euro zone countries, including Germany, are wary of granting significant debt relief measures to Greece. At the same time, most euro zone countries say they need IMF participation in order to contribute to the third bailout. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said that, while agreement on the debt terms and conditions was needed in the next few days or weeks, the implementation of measures could take longer. ""There is still a level of contingency,""she said. She also acknowledged that the prospect of a nominal debt writedown was not on the table.  Ball in Tsipras's court  Despite significant progress among bailout negotiators, particularly over pensions, much will rest on the Greek government's ability to legislate for the new ""contingency measures"" demanded by lenders.  The request for such measures is likely to dominate discussions between Greek officials and the institutions in Athens over the weekend.  Ms Lagarde said the extra measures, which would only be implemented if certain targets were not met, would ""have to be legislated upfront, have to be credible, and have to be triggered with a degree of automaticity"" that would not leave room for interpretation.  Klaus Regling, the head of the euro zone's rescue fund, the ESM, said he hoped agreement could be reached before the eurogroup meeting.  While he said debt relief measures would then be considered, he warned that, despite recent positive economic data on Greece, ""the future is uncertain"". He noted in particular the danger of Greece accumulating domestic arrears again. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-24,2007,"April 24, 2007",Rising blood pressure,"Heartbeat: Politicians are bad for your health. There ought to be a warning pinned on each politician as they come looking for your vote. I don't mean just health services, or rather the lack of them. I mean the rising ire and consequently blood pressure felt by the ordinary citizen when confronted by one unsustainable promise after another. This is not only a Government predilection; it appears to be a universal political plague. I am no Cassandra or doleful doomsayer, but common sense tells us that there are reasons for genuine concern in this economy right now. Many of these, such as rising interest rates and fuel prices and knock-on effects from other economies, are beyond our control. This does not excuse us from wringing our hands and doing nothing at all. We must seek to conserve what we have, and mitigate, in so far as we are able, these outside influences. We must eliminate the consequences of our own rash behaviour. If you individually, and we as a nation, choose to believe the promises and blandishments prepared for your seduction, then we shall assuredly end up with the Government we deserve. ""Anything you can do, I can do better"" is not an appropriate national hymn. How about some party saying that in these uncertain times, all that we can promise is that we will do our best and put the people first? That we will by organisation, consultation and rationalisation endeavour to provide decent services and standards in Government behaviour, in health, education, the environment, transport and communications. I'd vote for them. I don't want to hear about further tax cuts, these are simply not practicable if the economy dips. As for cutting PRSI, whatever became of Minister Séamus Brennan's pension ""time bomb""? Has its ticking clock been suspended until after the election? I suppose, in reason, if politicians handed out gale warnings and umbrellas, they would be unlikely to prosper, but let us consider favourably those who admit that sometime, even in the distant future, it might rain. But there are choices, and as Voltaire wrote, ""Si nous ne trouvon pas des choses agreeable, nous trouverons du moin des choses nouvelles"" translated as, ""if we don't find anything agreeable, at least we'll find something new"". I complain a lot, don't I? I will continue. Yesterday morning I spent one hour in traffic on the Rock Road between Merrion Avenue and the level crossing at Merrion gates, a distance of less than one mile. All around me, cars, buses, trucks and SUVs emitted happily. Drivers fretted, fumed, or relaxed, according to temperament. Presumably various enterprises were short staffed as these folk had to be going somewhere. How putting extra VRT liabilities on the luckless souls caught in these logjams will benefit anybody is beyond me, other than to impose yet another ""stealth"" tax. The traffic chaos is there now, before our new bus lane opens. God alone knows what will happen when it does. Bet you it won't be before the election, no point in further annoying the voters. In other ways, Minister Dick Roche, or should we call him Aladdin Roche, is really on the ball. He is to go around offering new lamps for old. There is a slight twist in the tale (tail), you're going to have to buy the new lamps yourself. You'd think that with an election coming, they would be given free. It's probably just a story that Aladdin wants the old lamps returned, to see that if by a communal rub of the party relic, a genie might be summoned to restore party fortunes! Meanwhile Minister, how about something as basic as clean water in Galway? Or maybe you might explain to us all, how it is that bottled water per litre costs more than petrol? Last week it was reported that the nurses who headed for the picket line in Portlaoise were applauded by patients as they went. That must be very heartening for them, and discouraging for those who never helped a patient and yet seek to denigrate those who do. In this regard, all credit to Dr Jimmy Devins, Fianna Fáil TD in Sligo and vice-chairman of the Oireachtas Health Committee who attended the nurses' protest in Sligo and said he was there to ""show support to what I believe are the just claims of the nurses"". Incidentally, I believe that the pay element of the nurses' claim could be settled tomorrow morning in a ""financially neutral"" way by simply granting all the nurses the EUR 56,000 salary that the Minister claims to be the national average. The greedy consultants have been shown to be just that, and all was on track to blame them for the Minister's failed service, when the bloody nurses got in the way. Suddenly we have a war on two fronts, something even Hitler found to be beyond him, ""Nacht und Webel"" indeed, night and fog, nowadays anaemically known as spin. Now we are to get new consultants, 60/2,000 - think of a number - who can join their colleagues already in place in looking at the wall, as there are no beds to allow them do their jobs. For my medical and nursing colleagues at all grades throughout the State, this has been a very bad time. For the patients it has been worse. I ask our profession to keep the faith amidst the vituperation and misrepresentation, and I have the temerity to pass on advice received recently by me from a younger colleague returned from North America, ""never get into a pissing contest with skunks"".

The Irish Times,Apr-24,2020,"April 24, 2020",Food crisis demands global response,"Sir, - In a stark warning, the UN's World Food Programme predicted the Covid-19 pandemic could trigger a global food crisis that would double the number of people suffering from severe hunger to 265 million people, or 53 times the population of Ireland. The poorest and most vulnerable people will not be able to cope with this pandemic. Here in Europe, Covid-19 is stretching our health systems and economies to their limits. For the world's poorest and most vulnerable people, rising unemployment, rising food prices and strict lockdowns will make it impossible for families to find food each day. As President Michael D Higgins noted in a speech this week, for the world's poorest people a lockdown is ""an invitation to starve"". According to António Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, ""we must redouble our efforts to defeat hunger and malnutrition. We have the tools and the know-how. What we need is political will and sustained commitment by leaders and nations."" Ireland is suffering enormous economic and human loss. Despite this, the country should be commended for not losing sight of the need for the world to fight this crisis together.  The Government has increased its funding for the World Health Organisation and, through Irish Aid, has committed vital funds to protecting the world's most vulnerable people from this virus.  People who have little to spare are donating what they can to Trócaire and other NGOs. But there is more that we can do - indeed, there is more that we must do. The world's poorest people worry less about whether Covid-19 will kill them in a month's time than about whether their children will have enough to eat today. - Yours, etc, CAOIMHE DE BARRA,  Chief Executive, Trócaire, Maynooth, Co Kildare.  Sir, - As the head of the UN World Food Programme warned this week of ""famine on a biblical scale"", it is important to remind readers that while the threat is very real, the outcome is far from inevitable. In 2017, when 20 million lives were at imminent risk of famine, catastrophe was largely averted.  Though delayed, an intense response mounted by the humanitarian community helped overcome the threat. Irish NGOs, Irish Aid and the Irish public were a key part of that. This time, as Covid-19 spreads and food supply networks collapse further, that threat is suddenly far deeper and it comes at a time when our own solidarity will undoubtedly be tested. As a nation we now face into an uncertain economic outlook, but we must remind ourselves that the threat of the pandemic cannot be tackled in isolation.  Where a pandemic exists anywhere, it can strike again everywhere. Never before have our obligations and our interests converged so immediately. - Yours, etc,  DOMINIC MacSORLEY,  Chief Executive, Concern Worldwide,  Camden Street, Dublin 2. ",1

The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (Iaasa) has told auditing firms it expects existing accounting standards to be applied with no relaxation to take into account uncertainty thrown up by the coronavirus pandemic.  ""It's highly possible that we will see an increase in qualified audit opinions, and we expect a lot of disclosures in directors' reports on the impact of Covid-19 on going concern,"" Fergal O'Briain, head of finance and administration at the watchdog, told The Irish Times.  ""Many accounting estimates use predictions about the future, which may be very uncertain at this time, and auditors simply won't be able to form an opinion on them.""  Covid-19 restrictions have already served as a catalyst for a number of business collapses globally in the past month.

Bounce back  ""The retail, hospitality, tourism and aviation sectors are areas where Covid-19 has had a serious impact,"" said John Cleary, director of risk compliance and professional standards at Grant Thornton in Ireland. ""Some industries and businesses will be able to bounce back quite quickly after restrictions are lifted. But most will find that while flicking the switch to turn off activity was one thing, it will not be as easy to flick the switch to turn things back on again as quickly."" Mr Cleary said there will be instances where audit opinions will be qualified, contain material uncertainty paragraphs or potentially require disclaimers of opinion. ""There may even be cases where directors will not be able to prepare accounts on a going-concern basis, and will have to prepare them instead on a break-up basis,"" Mr Cleary said.  Factors that must be considered regarding the going-concern issue will include companies' financial reserves heading into the crisis, the extent to which they have been given credit by suppliers or banks, and their ability to negotiate continuing support from financiers and stakeholders, he said. ""There is also additional emphasis now on looking not just at the short-term but at the medium and longer term and whether companies are realistically revising their underlying operating plans, including assumptions and judgments used in preparing their forecasting models,"" he said.  Enda McDonagh, assurance leader at PwC Ireland, said that assessing the going concern issue in the current environment would require a lot more information from companies. ""Careful judgment on the validity and basis of the information will be critically assessed. Consideration of the [effects of the] pandemic on customers, future revenues and realisation of receivables and other assets may be needed,"" he said. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-24,2021,"April 24, 2021","What's left when the tax game is up? It's education, stupid; Educational capital looms ever larger as Ireland's great asset. But the system that produces it is haphazard and devoid of political direction","This week, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe more or less accepted that the old game is up. Moves towards a minimum global corporation tax rate are unstoppable. Ireland will no longer be able to use low corporate taxation as its unique selling point.  ""This moment,"" he acknowledged, ""has been coming for years; it's now happening, and it will have consequences."" The moment has indeed been coming for years. The moral case for Ireland seeking to prosper by helping to rob its friends of tax revenues has long evaporated. The remarkable thing is not that the old order is running out of road but that it has lasted so long. So what else have we got? Three things: culture, environment and education.  The first two of those are not success stories for the State. Support for the arts and culture has been consistently among the worst in the developed world. The systematic degradation of an almost pristine environment is one of the great scandals of the last half century. Education is different. The vast expansion of the education system is the one big thing the State has managed to achieve. It has immense intrinsic value in allowing citizens to expand their horizons and aspirations. But it has also been crucial to economic development and, through the creation of a new middle class, to social change. Haphazard  What's striking, though, is how haphazard all of this has been. The State has never managed to think in a coherent way about education, to place it where it should be, which is at the heart of the story of Ireland's development. I recently reread TK Whitaker's epoch-making Economic Development, the blueprint for the revolution he launched with Seán Lemass in 1958, and thus for the creation of the modern Republic. It says nothing about education. At one level, this is extraordinary. Ireland in 1958 was one of the worst- educated countries in Europe. How could it possibly sustain an economic transformation if most young people either left school entirely at 14 or had only a year or two of further education or training? But at another level, the silence is easily explicable. Education was the business of the church. In 1956, Richard Mulcahy, the then minister for education, described his job as being that of ""a kind of dungaree man, the plumber who . . . will take the knock out of the pipes"". The State's role was humbly to service the church-controlled system, and certainly not to disturb it with impertinences such as policies. Officialdom was sickeningly smug about the maintenance of a model that fitted so many young people only for manual work and emigration. Áine Hyland, who was a young civil servant in the Department of Education in the early 1960s, later recalled that ""my colleagues were in no doubt that Ireland was fortunate in having the best education system in the world, so why did we need to change that? The fact that we had no evidence to prove this assertion was neither here nor there.""  Initial failure  This did change in the 1960s. There was a landmark report on Investment in Education in 1965. The dungaree job was taken on by some of Fianna Fáil's more ambitious ministers: Brian Lenihan, Patrick Hillery, George Colley and especially the bold and dynamic Donogh O'Malley. But the State never quite got over the initial failure, in the Whitaker-Lemass revolution, to see education as a driver, rather than a byproduct, of economic change. Even O'Malley's most famous initiative, the justly celebrated opening up of free secondary education, was largely a personal coup. It was not even discussed by the government in advance of its announcement by O'Malley - which means, of course, that its economic implications were not fully planned. Apart from that dramatic gesture, the watchword was caution. In 1989, John Coolahan wrote tellingly of the culture of the Department of Education: ""The approach taken was one of pragmatic gradualism. There has been a great reluctance within the Department of Education to reveal more than it has to or to go on public record on policy state- ments or analysis of the system . . . An important advantage of the lack of published policy statements for the public service, however, is that it allows maximum scope for ad hoc planning and for changing directions easily without public controversy."" Ad hoc planning is an oxymoron but also an all too accurate characterisation of the institutional culture. For the most part, the education system just grew. Some of the key innovations - suh as the creation of Educate Together schools - came from civil society. Huge anomalies, including church control of the primary and secondary school systems, have been allowed to fester. Joined-up thinking about the passage from preschool to post-grad has been largely absent. Large numbers of young people have been locked out of further and higher education, while the personal and economic cost of low educational achievement has risen. And yet, in all of this, there is a kind of triumph. From being one of the worst educated populations in Europe, we've become one of the best. The EU's long-term target for 2020 was that 40 per cent of its population between the ages of 30 and 34 would have degrees. By 2013, Ireland's figure was already 51 per cent. The growth of higher education has been spectacular. In 1991, we had 76,809 full-time students. By 2009, that number had almost doubled to 145,789. By 2019,it had reached 183,642. If you include part-timers, we now have over half a million people engaged in some form of higher education at any given time. This is the one big thing we've done for ourselves. It is the single most important accomplishment of the State. And yet it is weirdly weightless. It is not anchored in coherent long-term national planning. The bubble burst  This applies even to the most basic issue of who pays for the system. University fees were abolished in 1996. The Celtic Tiger regime compensated the universities with direct funding, but then slashed it when the bubble burst. Crucial infrastructural and research funding came as manna from Heaven, via Chuck Feeney's Atlantic Philanthropies - a source that has now dried up. Universities have survived increasingly by earning their own keep, through research grants and from foreign students. More than half their income now comes from sources other than the State. They've been, by default, largely privatised. So we've ended up with a deep contradiction. On the one hand, as Ireland's tax advantages fade, educational capital looms ever larger as our greatest asset. On the other, the system that creates that capital is, at first and second level, still based on an anachronistic 19th-century religious-based model. We haven't even managed to create what every other developed country has, which is actually free primary education. Meanwhile, the third-level world has been forced to become a different kind of private domain in which institutions have to be managed as if they were businesses. This can't go on. If the future depends on high skills rather than low taxes, we're betting our survival on that old oxymoron: ad hoc planning.  It's quite a gamble: that a system that has performed miracles with uncertain resources and without consistent political leadership will go on doing so. If the miracles dry up, what are we left with?",1
The Irish Times,Apr-25,2006,"April 25, 2006",Ireland ignores need for renewable energy at its peril,"The Government needs to shake up its act and take a serious look at alternative energy, writes Enda Kenny Most modern alarm clocks have a feature called the snooze button. It shuts off the alarm for a few minutes and lets the sleeper snooze a while longer. If you keep pressing the snooze button, you can stay in bed all day. When it comes to Ireland's energy policy, and especially our over-reliance on oil, this Government still has its pyjamas on. In 2003 the price of a barrel of oil stood at around $35. Last year, and again last week, it exceeded $70. Many economists warn that the days of $100 per barrel of oil may not be too far away. We have already seen forecasts of petrol reaching EUR 1.20 a litre within weeks. The energy crisis poses a major economic challenge. Rising oil prices, global instability and a general acceptance that oil reserves will grow less and less dependable should act as a wake-up call for those who think we can continue as we are and not risk major economic problems in the decades ahead. Coupled with this price pressure are the repercussions of our failure to meet our commitments under the Kyoto agreement. It is worth noting that, when considering the costs of these proposals, if agreed commitments on emissions under the Kyoto agreement are not met, Ireland will face a bill of up to EUR 400 million. This is neither sensible nor sustainable. We have to recognise the fact - and seek to change it - that Ireland's consumption of renewable energy is extremely low. It is time for Ireland to get serious about renewable energy. In the absence of any co-ordinated strategy from the Government in this vital area, Fine Gael recently published Energy for the Future. This plan has been developed on foot of some initial proposals unveiled at our national conference last November and is significant for several reasons, primary among them being the joined-up thinking that lies at the plan's core. It was drawn up by the party's environment, transport, energy and agriculture spokespersons to ensure its policy proposals were co-ordinated and consistent. This is the type of approach needed to secure our longer-term energy requirements. Transport is Ireland's biggest carbon dioxide producer and, together with home heating, generates 60 per cent of the country's energy demands. We know that car-use has doubled since 1980, and that if there is no policy change by 2020, it will have doubled again. And, of course, the greatest growth in cars has been in the larger, energy-guzzling ones. At any level, that kind of growth in car usage is not sustainable - from a congestion point of view or from an environmental point of view. From an economic point of view it is madness to leave ourselves dependent on an uncertain and increasingly expensive oil supply to move all our goods and almost all our people. Fine Gael is committed to switch those cars and trucks away from absolute dependence on imported fossil fuel to the use of biofuels. The beauty of biofuels is that they are renewable, and they are cleaner, producing 60 per cent less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels, and would of course give us at least a partial domestic transport energy supply source. The plan contains a set of recommendations, costed at EUR 488 million up to 2010, that will move Ireland definitively down the road of a more sustainable approach to our national energy policy. Some of the key proposals include:  Removal of all excise duty on biofuels produced from renewable energy crops,  Reforming the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) system through the establishment of energy-efficient labelling for motor vehicles with lower and higher rates of VRT for fuel efficient and inefficient vehicles respectively.  Create a market for biofuels by legislating that all motor fuels must include a blend of fuel from renewable sources. All petrol sold will include a 5 per cent bio-ethanol mix and all diesels would contain a 2 per cent bio-diesel mix.  Provide seed capital for biofuel producer groups who would be chosen, through public competition, to operate a selected number of biofuel processing plants.  Targeted grants of between EUR 500 and EUR 3,500 to encourage householders to convert to renewable energy for home heating,  Require all public transport vehicles and public service vehicles to convert, where practical and feasible, to forms of biofuel.  Establish a centre of excellence for alternative energy charged with ensuring Ireland develops a world-class alternative energy sector. Renewable energy has been contributing nearly 2 per cent of Ireland's primary energy supply since 1990. In 2003, biomass contributed 1.2 per cent, hydropower 0.34 per cent and wind energy 0.26 per cent of Ireland's energy requirements. However, as the price of oil climbs ever higher - and supply becomes less and less secure- we must strike a better balance. Our European partners already have a head start. In 2001, Austria was sourcing 22 per cent of its energy consumption from renewable sources. The Fine Gael plan for alternative energy outlines how we will begin to tackle the problem of our over-dependence on imported, unclean energy and ensure that we can reach that ambitious target of 33 per cent of our energy being generated from renewable sources.  Enda Kenny TD is the leader of Fine Gael.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-25,2008,"April 25, 2008",Pay talks must protect vulnerable in tougher times,"ECONOMICS: It is vital to protect the economy as conditions worsen, but any future pay deal must also address employees' rising living costs, writes PAUL TANSEY THERE WAS a chasm separating employers and trade unions as the talks on a new national pay deal commenced this week. On the employers' side, businesses are suffering. Growth in the markets facing Irish firms is weakening as the domestic boom runs out of steam and recession stalks Ireland's principal export markets. Efforts to hold market share in stuttering markets at home and abroad are undermined by the erosion of Irish price competitiveness. Rising domestic prices are pushing up the cost base of Irish-based firms. To add exchange rate insult to inflationary injury, the near 20 per cent appreciation of the euro against sterling and the dollar over the past year has severely compromised the competitiveness of Irish goods and services at home and abroad.   If all of this were not enough, the availability of credit is tightening while the cost of money is rising. As the credit crunch bites deeper, Irish interest rates have decoupled from the official rates set by the European Central Bank (ECB). On wholesale markets this week, one-year money at one point was commanding a premium of one percentage point over the key official ECB rate of 4 per cent. Taking all of these trends together, Irish businesses operating in the traded sector of the economy are facing a substantial squeeze on profits. The bottom line is bleeding. The majority of indigenous firms facing foreign competition simply do not possess the resources to finance large pay increases out of current earnings. On the other side of the table, trade unions are also feeling the pain. On the pay front, an unanticipated surge in inflation over the past two years has wiped out most, if not all, of the purchasing power gains conferred by the basic terms of the last pay deal. Growing disparities in earnings between officers and other ranks have rubbed salt in the wounds of minimal advances in real wages over the past two years. The widening gap was brought home to public-service workers by the contrast between large awards made to some top public servants by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector and the virtual pay standstill recommended for public-service foot soldiers in the second benchmarking report. Moreover, the negotiations are complicated by the array of non-pay issues on the agenda. These include the deterioration in private-sector pension provision consequent on the fall in markets and the shift to defined-benefit schemes; trade union representation rights; the treatment of agency workers; and the status of industrial relations law. Against this background, employers are arguing that they can live only with small increases in wages under any new agreement. Trade unions are seeking, at minimum, increases in line with inflation - currently at an annual rate of 5 per cent - and prospective productivity growth. There is a further negotiating problem centred on the prospective rate of inflation. Leading forecasters are projecting a steep deceleration in the inflation rate this year and next. This month, the Central Bank forecast that consumer price inflation would slow from 4.9 per cent in 2007 to 3.2 per cent this year and 1.6 per cent in 2009. This view was broadly shared by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in its last set of forecasts published in March. It anticipated that consumer price inflation would ease back to 3.4 per cent this year, before decelerating further to 2.2 per cent in 2009. But the trade unions do not buy these forecasts. They expect inflation to remain well above the rates projected by the Central Bank and the ESRI. Having been outflanked by rising prices last time around, the unions do not want to fall into the same trap twice. Thus, even allowing for the inevitable grandstanding by both sides prior to the commencement of negotiations, the initial gap between the bargaining positions of the two sides is very wide. Moreover, both can mount convincing cases to justify those positions. So what is to be done? As economic conditions continue to deteriorate - in Ireland and across the industrial world - the first priority is to safeguard the economy in which people work, earn and live. This places competitiveness at the top of the agenda. It would be counterproductive to negotiate substantial pay increases that would cause firms to close and jobs to be lost. In these difficult and uncertain times, protecting what we have is paramount. Every effort should be made to preserve social partnership agreements and the pay deals that are their centrepiece, but not at any cost. At the same time, it must be recognised that modest pay increases would provide little solace to employees struggling with steeply rising food and energy prices, large mortgage bills and diminished wealth as house prices continue to fall. Their positions, too, need to be safeguarded. In the context of a national pay agreement, the living standards of employees could be supported by reducing taxes on income, specifically employee contribution rates for PRSI. Last year's Programme for Government already commits the Government to cut PRSI rates for full-rate payers from 4 per cent to 2 per cent over the lifetime of this administration. It could be introduced in budget 2009. Additionally, given the differing perspectives on future inflation, a low basic pay increase might be agreed, with a supplementary pay rise triggered where actual inflation exceeds a defined threshold. If the current inflationary expectations of trade unions are found to be excessive, then only the modest basic increase would be paid. If they were proved correct, workers would be compensated. This approach, however, might not recommend itself to employers who, above all, are looking for certainty in centralised collective bargaining agreements. However, such an approach would have the distinct advantage of providing Government with a strong financial incentive for ensuring that the fall in import costs caused by the strength of the euro is actually passed on to businesses and consumers in the form of lower prices. This is manifestly not the case at present. Of course, national pay agreements are not set in stone. If negotiators cannot reach a wage deal that benefits both sides, all bets are off and there would be a reversion to free collective bargaining. Many would applaud just such an outcome, but they should be careful of what they wish for. Free collective bargaining would reward the strong and punish the weak. Those operating in the non-traded sector - in local monopolies and the public sector - would benefit while those in the traded sector, particularly low-skilled workers in vulnerable industries, would suffer. The transition to new types of bargaining procedures would cause dislocation and, most probably, an increased incidence of industrial disputes. But the principal costs would be social, not economic. Social partnership has been an attempt, often muddled, at creating a common bond - a sense of belonging - among all who live in Ireland at a time when exceptional economic change has placed great stress on the social fabric. Prolonged booms usually induce sharp redistributions of income, widening the gap between rich and poor. The evidence suggests this has not happened in Ireland. Income inequality has not decreased, but neither has it increased appreciably. Prof Robert Erikson of the Swedish Institute of Social Research wrote last year*: ""The general increase in income does not seem to have been matched by a general change in income inequality, except for a possible but uncertain increase of the relative share of the very highest incomes."" The Irish social partnership model, supported by the policies of successive governments, is founded on the belief that there is such a thing as society. This is not an article of faith that should be lightly discarded. We are more than a collection of individual self-interested profit-maximisers. *Best of Times?, edited by Tony Fahey, Helen Russell, Christopher T Whelan, IPA, 2007, page 271.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-25,2009,"April 25, 2009",The life and death of Michael Dwyer,"Was Michael Dwyer a militant involved in a plot to assassinate Bolivia s president or a bodyguard unaware of the company he was keeping? ask TOM HENNIGANin Santa Cruz, Bolivia IN THE EARLY hours of April 16th, Michael Dwyer s young life came to a brutal end, machine-gunned to death in room 457 of the Hotel Las Americas, in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. It was 4am when around 30 members of an elite police squad swarmed into the hotel, cut the phone line, and demanded that night staff tell them where the Irishman and his four travelling companions were staying. They were the only guests on the fourth floor, in a row of five rooms. Having located their quarry, police silently made their way upstairs. The next thing the two staff members on duty heard was a huge explosion that shook the building, followed by 10 to 15 minutes of intense gunfire, a rain of bullets in the words of the night manager. Today, as Dwyer s remains are due to make their final journey to his home in Ballinderry, Co Tipperary, almost every aspect of the raid is sunk in controversy. The only undisputed facts are that by the end of it, the 24-year-old lay dead in his room, as did the occupants of the rooms on either side of his. The two other men in the group a Hungarian and a Bolivian of Croatian origin were arrested at the scene. The only witnesses, apart from the officers involved, are now being held in isolation cells in a maximum security prison in the capital La Paz, more than 900km away. Dwyer s body still lay in room 457 when Bolivia s vice-president gave a press conference in the capital saying police had broken up a cell of mercenary terrorists who planned to assassinate Evo Morales, the country s left-wing president. Since then, the government has claimed the group was linked to right-wing separatists in Santa Cruz who want independence for eastern Bolivia. The Dwyer family have dismissed the accusations about their son as preposterous. In Santa Cruz, a ramshackle boomtown on Bolivia s tropical eastern plains that is the motor of the country s economy, many believe the men were summarily executed, victims of a dangerous escalation in the struggle between Santa Cruz and La Paz over the destiny of South America s poorest nation. Family and friends of the former bouncer and security guard understood that Dwyer went to Bolivia last November to take part in a bodyguard training course. But one source described it as a course that never was . On realising this, several of Dwyer s travelling companions reportedly left Bolivia but he decided to stay on. It was around this time that he met a 49-year-old Bolivian of Hungarian descent named Eduardo Rózsa Flores, the man killed in room 458 and named by the authorities as the group s leader. Flores came from a well-known family in Santa Cruz. His father was a Hungarian communist émigré and painter. The family fled one of Bolivia s numerous military dictatorships and went to Chile. When Pinochet staged his coup, they moved to Europe. A communist in his youth, Flores later fought with the Croatians in the Balkans conflict, and was awarded Croat citizenship. After the war, he worked as a documentary filmmaker and wrote poetry. He later converted to Islam and supported a wide and often contradictory range of causes, many on the right-wing fringe. One was a group that advocated autonomy for ethnic Hungarians in Romania. Sources say that other members of this group worked in security in Ireland and may well have introduced Dwyer to Flores. By early January, Dwyer, Flores and four other men two Hungarians, an ethnic Hungarian travelling on a Romanian passport, and a Bolivian with a Croat passport checked into the four-star Asturias hotel in Santa Cruz, where they stayed until April 3rd. One of these four the Romanian Arpad Magyarosi was killed in room 456 in the Hotel Las Americas. One staff member at the hotel remembers Dwyer clearly. He was lovely. He did not speak Spanish but he was a good person. We remember him playing around by the pool, singing. He didn t seem at all like what they say he is now. The Asturias s owner, Maria Diez, says the group seemed close and Dwyer was an integral part of it. The Irishman was very well behaved, always polite, remembers Diez. He had his own room but was very friendly with the others. They breakfasted together and in the evenings were around the pool together. We never saw them with anyone else and they never said what they were doing in Bolivia. But they were good guests, never drinking excessively or anything like that.  Little is known about what the group did during their weeks in the Asturias. Staff said they did not seem to have a regular routine that implied they were working. THE IRISH TIMEShas seen evidence that during this time Dwyer and his companions made at least one excursion into the countryside around Santa Cruz. It has also seen evidence that the group enjoyed a social life in Santa Cruz and had several nights out with locals. They visited the city s bowling alley and Dwyer went with local friends to at least one football game. They had evenings out in the city s bars and an area where young people gather in cars and Santa Cruz s ubiquitous 4x4s for parties. There is also evidence that Dwyer had a girlfriend. During the group s stay in the Asturias, The Irish Timeshas learned that Flores was in the company of local separatist extremists and that at one such encounter in February, Dwyer was present. But given that Dwyer s Spanish extended little beyond gracias , it is uncertain that he would have understood whatever conversations Flores had at this time. It is also unknown how much Dwyer knew about the tense political situation in Santa Cruz, especially in the months leading up to his arrival, when the unrest threatened to spill over into open violence between the country s east and west. On April 3rd the group moved to the five-star Hotel Santa Cruz, closer to the central plaza. As at the Asturias, staff here remember always seeing the group together, but in no way drawing attention to themselves or seeming out of the ordinary. We get a lot of business groups here. I just thought they were foreigners in Santa Cruz to buy land, says one employee. The city s major theatre festival had booked up the Hotel Santa Cruz from April 14th, so the group had to move again. This time they went to the four-star Hotel Las Americas. Less of a holiday resort than the Asturias, and less plush than the Hotel Santa Cruz, it is a functional business hotel on the grittier side of the central plaza. At night on blocks nearby, prostitutes tout for business. The group checked in and Dwyer did not leave the hotel again, according to staff. After a busy Easter week, business was slow and the group had the fourth floor to themselves. They told the maids not to bother making up their rooms, which staff did not enter after they arrived. The group had their own food with them and ate in their rooms, according to Hernan Rossell, the hotel s manager. The only time Dwyer was again seen by staff was when he appeared in the lobby looking for a stronger Wi-Fi signal on Wednesday, April 15th, says Rossell. Apart from the other members of the group, it seems the next people to see him were those who killed him. These are the facts known about Dwyer s sojourn in Bolivia and they raise more questions than they answer. Was there an armed confrontation between police and the five guests on the fourth floor of the Hotel Las Americas, or were Dwyer and his two colleagues summarily executed as many in Santa Cruz believe? Were there guns in the rooms and is the group linked to an arms cache found in the city shortly after the police raid, as the authorities say? How come three of the five died from multiple gunshot wounds to the chest with not a single head, leg or arm wound between them while their two companions were taken prisoner almost unscathed? How was it that the 30 or so officers involved did not suffer a single wound between them in what they say was a half-hour shoot-out? Why, as reported by the hotel s manager, are all the bullet holes in the walls of the fourth floor inside the bedrooms, with none appearing to be the result of gunfire fired from inside the rooms towards attackers in the corridor? If the five men were under surveillance for weeks, as the government claims, how did they then supposedly manage to plant a small bomb that partially destroyed the front gate of the house of Santa Cruz s cardinal the night before the raid on their hotel, as the police claim? And if the group was as armed and dangerous as the government says, why was this attack so inept, blowing just a small hole in the wooden gate at a time when the cardinal was not even at home? And why did Flores, a former war veteran, not practice even the most basic of security precautions if his group had just carried out a terrorist act? They were caught like rats in a trap found holed up on the fourth floor of a hotel with little possibility of escape should they be discovered, in the centre of the city where they had allegedly just placed a bomb. THERE ARE ALSO many unanswered questions about what led the group to the Hotel Las Americas. In a video recording with a Hungarian journalist that Flores asked be released in the event of his death, Flores claimed he had returned to the town at the request of the Council of Santa Cruz in order to organise self-defence groups to take on what he called pro-government elements. But this video was the first time anyone had heard of the Council of Santa Cruz. What is it and who bankrolled the group s six-month stay in the city? Having supposedly gone to do a bodyguard training course that fell through, did Dwyer instead accept an unspecified security job from Flores? Did Flores lead him to believe that this was in some way official work linked to the opposition-controlled regional government? Dwyer s actions in the months leading up to his death do not hint at someone who thought he was involved in clandestine activities. But on his Bebo page, since taken down, he would only vaguely say that he was travellin, workin, doin a bit a dis and a bit a dat . The official investigation now under way will supposedly attempt to answer some of these questions. But it is already being undermined by a government intent to use the events of the last 10 days to attack the opposition. Its work is being prejudged by officials, led by the vice-president, who have made their own charges against Dwyer and the others without providing evidence. Two high-ranking Bolivian legal officials have told The Irish Timesthat the investigation breaks all standard legal procedures. It is ugly. The legal process is already totally contaminated, they are breaking the law with impunity, says one official. The Irish, Croatian and Hungarian governments have called for an international inquiry. Bolivia s government has vacillated on whether to agree to this outside scrutiny. Such an inquiry, even at a remove from the events, might be able to solve many of these riddles. But it is unlikely to be able to answer the two questions at the heart of the brutal death of Michael Dwyer in room 457. Did he ever fully understand what Flores a charismatic advocate of obscure causes and whose posthumously-released video hints at something of a martyr complex was up to in Bolivia? And just what exactly did he think he was doing in Bolivia during his six-month stay? &#8216;He was a dreamer. Naive maybe&#8217; MICHAEL DWYER was a child of his time and place. Born into a generation that grew up in an era of plenty, his path through life seemed pleasantly ordinary and effortless. He was the second of four children of Martin and Caroline Dwyer, an electrician and pharmaceutical engineer respectively, living near the village of Ballinderry, on the picturesque Lake Drive in north Tipperary. Former classmates struggle to remember any distinguishing features about him, beyond the fact that he was an ordinary, likeable, easy-going youth.At St Joseph s secondary school in Borrisoleigh, the principal, Padraig O Shea, described a model student . At the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), where he began a four-year degree course in construction management in 2004, he was also regarded as a good student by his lecturers, pleasant and popular among his peers, kind and caring to his friends.He was also an enthusiastic hurler. He was a bit of a hero as he was from Tipperary and he was well able to hurl - he could give it timber. A very nice fella always, says Tom Lane, of the Menlo Emmets GAA club in Galway. His Facebook page reveals him as a member of the Willie O Dea Fan Club - set up to have a laugh at the Minister for Defence - and of another group calling for the return of Féile, the Thurles music festival.In the context of his violent death, bewilderment is the dominant tone of any comment. A nice guy, but he couldn t plan his own birthday, never mind an assassination, say friends in Ballinderry. He could hardly plot his way to the gents, never mind the convoluted politics of Bolivian separatism. No one I know of has ever heard him utter a political opinion, says another in Galway. He was no mastermind, says a young man who knew him briefly. I d have thought he was a bit of a dreamer. Naive maybe. He was also good at talking himself up , by all accounts.A wiser youth - not to mention an alleged plotter - would have opted to keep his online social networking private. The fact that a 24-year-old college graduate chose to make his life an open book on Bebo and Facebook is testament to at least a degree of naivety. Pictures of him and friends dressed in black Swat (US police special weapons and tactical units) team uniforms and posing in camouflage gear with heavy weapons in a forest, along with a penchant for silly online quizzes in which participants answer questions that sort them into jackal or sniper types, have been swooped on as evidence of sinister militarist inclinations.The pedestrian truth is that the Swat pictures were taken at a Halloween party in a Galway nightclub. The camouflage gear and guns are a big part of the attraction of Airsoft games (akin to paintballing), run by Martin Cummins (AKA MaxForce) and his wife Evelyn on a skirmish site near Portumna, Co Galway. He liked dressing up in macho gear. Contrary to early media reports, he had no military training and had no connection with the armed forces.Like many college students trying to boost their income, he worked as a bouncer for Praetorian, a large, Oranmore-based security company (which folded last year due to revenue non-compliance). In January 2008, while working towards his finals at GMIT, he obtained a door supervisor s licence from the Private Security Authority of Ireland (PSAI) and worked at the Central Park nightclub. After a Fás advertising campaign, he was recruited by Integrated Risk Management Systems (I-RMS), which is run by ex-Army Rangers near Naas, Co Kildare, and licensed as Business Mobile Security Services. According to a company statement, he worked with it as a security guard on the controversial Corrib gas pipeline project from March until his contract ended on October 20th, 2008. Prior to being recruited by I-RMS, reads the statement, Mr Dwyer had been working part-time as a door supervisor in Galway and held a Private Security Authority of Ireland (PSA) licence, which included a full Garda background check. Nonetheless, it was only towards the end of April last year that Dwyer formally applied for a security guard s licence, required by law to work on sites such as the Corrib project. The current system allows applicants to take up work while their applications are pending but in the event, he chose not to proceed with the application, the PSAI told The Irish Times. In effect, he worked without a licence during his eight months with I-RMS.Some 21,000 individuals are licensed to work as bouncers and/or security guards in the State and at one point, a third of these were thought to be non-EU nationals, some with exotic backgrounds. Dwyer had requested time off from I-RMS to sit his finals and graduated from GMIT with a degree in construction management, a qualification of little relevance in a collapsing economy. By the time construction work had wrapped up for the winter and his I-RMS contract had run out, he had already met at least one of the people who would be somehow connected to his fate in Bolivia. This was a Hungarian who also worked with I-RMS, who was in the group of four (including two Poles) that left Ireland for a purported bodyguard course in Bolivia in November, and who happened to be acquainted with Eduardo Rózsa Flores, the alleged leader of the gang of mercenaries killed in the Bolivian hotel.While the other three returned to Ireland when the course failed to materialise, Michael Dwyer stayed on with Flores. Comments from friends at home suggest wide confusion about his purpose in Bolivia. Some seemed convinced, for example, that he had gone there with a job already in hand. The Irish Times has established that the onward flights from Madrid to Bolivia were paid for by someone else; one explanation is that they were part of an all-in course package. His father told RTÉ that Dwyer had said there was some wealthy guy out there that he d got in with . . . he didn t elaborate any more after that as to who it was or anything .In Bolivia, Dwyer continued to document his life, openly, with lots of exclamation marks, in his Bebo and Facebook pages. The tattoo (visible on his corpse) that has triggered much neo-Nazi -style chatter in online forums and dismissed by friends as drawn freestyle by the tattoo artist, was mentioned excitedly in his reports. Got a new tattoo. It s hugh (sic) and sore!!!! South American insects were as big as freakin cats man . There were cheerful pictures - entitled hols - of Dwyer holding a tropical orchid, standing cheek to cheek with pretty local girls, Dwyer in a bowling alley, having a beer outdoors with friends at the open boot of what may have been the new BMW he mentioned - he was happiest, he said, when cruising in my new bmw in south America . A friend on the politics.ie site railed against suggestions that there was something suspicious about such a newly-arrived 24-year-old acquiring a BMW: im sure he had savings like the rest of us i no its hard to believe a 24yr old can afford a bmw but im sure they are not that expensive over there . . . The divide between conventional internet users and the kind who uninhibitedly use Bebo and Facebook to document their lives (and tag their mundane pictures with obviously outlandish captions) is stark in this story. Prodrift on tour and Soldiers of Fortune - captions on pictures of Michael Dwyer s arrival in Bolivia - are analysed and pored over by posters on Politics.ie but dismissed by defenders as just that: captions.Prodrift is a type of car racing with league tables openly displayed on Irish websites. His last status update on his Facebook page on April 9th said he was playing Motorcycle Madness and just achieved Level 6, Tricycle III .A friend on politics.ie describes him as a really nice guy and would not of been involved with anything they are saying. I know him and have known him for a long time, he was kind and caring. He is loved by anyone he ever met and would be the first one there if you needed him as he has been for me in the past. He would have been 25 in June. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-25,2009,"April 25, 2009",The life and death of Michael Dwyer,"Was Michael Dwyer a militant involved in a plot to assassinate Bolivia s president or a bodyguard unaware of the company he was keeping? ask TOM HENNIGANin Santa Cruz, Bolivia IN THE EARLY hours of April 16th, Michael Dwyer s young life came to a brutal end, machine-gunned to death in room 457 of the Hotel Las Americas, in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. It was 4am when around 30 members of an elite police squad swarmed into the hotel, cut the phone line, and demanded that night staff tell them where the Irishman and his four travelling companions were staying. They were the only guests on the fourth floor, in a row of five rooms. Having located their quarry, police silently made their way upstairs. The next thing the two staff members on duty heard was a huge explosion that shook the building, followed by 10 to 15 minutes of intense gunfire, a rain of bullets in the words of the night manager. Today, as Dwyer s remains are due to make their final journey to his home in Ballinderry, Co Tipperary, almost every aspect of the raid is sunk in controversy. The only undisputed facts are that by the end of it, the 24-year-old lay dead in his room, as did the occupants of the rooms on either side of his. The two other men in the group a Hungarian and a Bolivian of Croatian origin were arrested at the scene. The only witnesses, apart from the officers involved, are now being held in isolation cells in a maximum security prison in the capital La Paz, more than 900km away. Dwyer s body still lay in room 457 when Bolivia s vice-president gave a press conference in the capital saying police had broken up a cell of mercenary terrorists who planned to assassinate Evo Morales, the country s left-wing president. Since then, the government has claimed the group was linked to right-wing separatists in Santa Cruz who want independence for eastern Bolivia. The Dwyer family have dismissed the accusations about their son as preposterous. In Santa Cruz, a ramshackle boomtown on Bolivia s tropical eastern plains that is the motor of the country s economy, many believe the men were summarily executed, victims of a dangerous escalation in the struggle between Santa Cruz and La Paz over the destiny of South America s poorest nation. Family and friends of the former bouncer and security guard understood that Dwyer went to Bolivia last November to take part in a bodyguard training course. But one source described it as a course that never was . On realising this, several of Dwyer s travelling companions reportedly left Bolivia but he decided to stay on. It was around this time that he met a 49-year-old Bolivian of Hungarian descent named Eduardo Rózsa Flores, the man killed in room 458 and named by the authorities as the group s leader. Flores came from a well-known family in Santa Cruz. His father was a Hungarian communist émigré and painter. The family fled one of Bolivia s numerous military dictatorships and went to Chile. When Pinochet staged his coup, they moved to Europe. A communist in his youth, Flores later fought with the Croatians in the Balkans conflict, and was awarded Croat citizenship. After the war, he worked as a documentary filmmaker and wrote poetry. He later converted to Islam and supported a wide and often contradictory range of causes, many on the right-wing fringe. One was a group that advocated autonomy for ethnic Hungarians in Romania. Sources say that other members of this group worked in security in Ireland and may well have introduced Dwyer to Flores. By early January, Dwyer, Flores and four other men two Hungarians, an ethnic Hungarian travelling on a Romanian passport, and a Bolivian with a Croat passport checked into the four-star Asturias hotel in Santa Cruz, where they stayed until April 3rd. One of these four the Romanian Arpad Magyarosi was killed in room 456 in the Hotel Las Americas. One staff member at the hotel remembers Dwyer clearly. He was lovely. He did not speak Spanish but he was a good person. We remember him playing around by the pool, singing. He didn t seem at all like what they say he is now. The Asturias s owner, Maria Diez, says the group seemed close and Dwyer was an integral part of it. The Irishman was very well behaved, always polite, remembers Diez. He had his own room but was very friendly with the others. They breakfasted together and in the evenings were around the pool together. We never saw them with anyone else and they never said what they were doing in Bolivia. But they were good guests, never drinking excessively or anything like that.  Little is known about what the group did during their weeks in the Asturias. Staff said they did not seem to have a regular routine that implied they were working. THE IRISH TIMEShas seen evidence that during this time Dwyer and his companions made at least one excursion into the countryside around Santa Cruz. It has also seen evidence that the group enjoyed a social life in Santa Cruz and had several nights out with locals. They visited the city s bowling alley and Dwyer went with local friends to at least one football game. They had evenings out in the city s bars and an area where young people gather in cars and Santa Cruz s ubiquitous 4x4s for parties. There is also evidence that Dwyer had a girlfriend. During the group s stay in the Asturias, The Irish Timeshas learned that Flores was in the company of local separatist extremists and that at one such encounter in February, Dwyer was present. But given that Dwyer s Spanish extended little beyond gracias , it is uncertain that he would have understood whatever conversations Flores had at this time. It is also unknown how much Dwyer knew about the tense political situation in Santa Cruz, especially in the months leading up to his arrival, when the unrest threatened to spill over into open violence between the country s east and west. On April 3rd the group moved to the five-star Hotel Santa Cruz, closer to the central plaza. As at the Asturias, staff here remember always seeing the group together, but in no way drawing attention to themselves or seeming out of the ordinary. We get a lot of business groups here. I just thought they were foreigners in Santa Cruz to buy land, says one employee. The city s major theatre festival had booked up the Hotel Santa Cruz from April 14th, so the group had to move again. This time they went to the four-star Hotel Las Americas. Less of a holiday resort than the Asturias, and less plush than the Hotel Santa Cruz, it is a functional business hotel on the grittier side of the central plaza. At night on blocks nearby, prostitutes tout for business. The group checked in and Dwyer did not leave the hotel again, according to staff. After a busy Easter week, business was slow and the group had the fourth floor to themselves. They told the maids not to bother making up their rooms, which staff did not enter after they arrived. The group had their own food with them and ate in their rooms, according to Hernan Rossell, the hotel s manager. The only time Dwyer was again seen by staff was when he appeared in the lobby looking for a stronger Wi-Fi signal on Wednesday, April 15th, says Rossell. Apart from the other members of the group, it seems the next people to see him were those who killed him. These are the facts known about Dwyer s sojourn in Bolivia and they raise more questions than they answer. Was there an armed confrontation between police and the five guests on the fourth floor of the Hotel Las Americas, or were Dwyer and his two colleagues summarily executed as many in Santa Cruz believe? Were there guns in the rooms and is the group linked to an arms cache found in the city shortly after the police raid, as the authorities say? How come three of the five died from multiple gunshot wounds to the chest with not a single head, leg or arm wound between them while their two companions were taken prisoner almost unscathed? How was it that the 30 or so officers involved did not suffer a single wound between them in what they say was a half-hour shoot-out? Why, as reported by the hotel s manager, are all the bullet holes in the walls of the fourth floor inside the bedrooms, with none appearing to be the result of gunfire fired from inside the rooms towards attackers in the corridor? If the five men were under surveillance for weeks, as the government claims, how did they then supposedly manage to plant a small bomb that partially destroyed the front gate of the house of Santa Cruz s cardinal the night before the raid on their hotel, as the police claim? And if the group was as armed and dangerous as the government says, why was this attack so inept, blowing just a small hole in the wooden gate at a time when the cardinal was not even at home? And why did Flores, a former war veteran, not practice even the most basic of security precautions if his group had just carried out a terrorist act? They were caught like rats in a trap found holed up on the fourth floor of a hotel with little possibility of escape should they be discovered, in the centre of the city where they had allegedly just placed a bomb. THERE ARE ALSO many unanswered questions about what led the group to the Hotel Las Americas. In a video recording with a Hungarian journalist that Flores asked be released in the event of his death, Flores claimed he had returned to the town at the request of the Council of Santa Cruz in order to organise self-defence groups to take on what he called pro-government elements. But this video was the first time anyone had heard of the Council of Santa Cruz. What is it and who bankrolled the group s six-month stay in the city? Having supposedly gone to do a bodyguard training course that fell through, did Dwyer instead accept an unspecified security job from Flores? Did Flores lead him to believe that this was in some way official work linked to the opposition-controlled regional government? Dwyer s actions in the months leading up to his death do not hint at someone who thought he was involved in clandestine activities. But on his Bebo page, since taken down, he would only vaguely say that he was travellin, workin, doin a bit a dis and a bit a dat . The official investigation now under way will supposedly attempt to answer some of these questions. But it is already being undermined by a government intent to use the events of the last 10 days to attack the opposition. Its work is being prejudged by officials, led by the vice-president, who have made their own charges against Dwyer and the others without providing evidence. Two high-ranking Bolivian legal officials have told The Irish Timesthat the investigation breaks all standard legal procedures. It is ugly. The legal process is already totally contaminated, they are breaking the law with impunity, says one official. The Irish, Croatian and Hungarian governments have called for an international inquiry. Bolivia s government has vacillated on whether to agree to this outside scrutiny. Such an inquiry, even at a remove from the events, might be able to solve many of these riddles. But it is unlikely to be able to answer the two questions at the heart of the brutal death of Michael Dwyer in room 457. Did he ever fully understand what Flores a charismatic advocate of obscure causes and whose posthumously-released video hints at something of a martyr complex was up to in Bolivia? And just what exactly did he think he was doing in Bolivia during his six-month stay?",1
The Irish Times,Apr-25,2015,"April 25, 2015",EU must prioritise the saving of refugees' lives; Political extremism is already growing across much of Europe. We cannot give it a boost by craven inaction,"The summit of EU leaders on Thursday did little to erase the moral stain that is the Mediterranean refugee crisis. The conclusions they drew focused heavily on meeting one of their common obligations - to combat human smuggling - and precious little on an equally important one to which they are committed under international law - to provide protection to those fleeing conflict.  More people have perished in the Mediterranean this year than died on the Titanic; the rate at which people are drowning is 30 times that of last year.  What impact the EU's decisions will have on this is uncertain. Some of the people crossing the sea do not qualify for protection and do not have a right to be in Europe - that is clear. But many of them - perhaps about half, judging from UN estimates - have a legitimate right to international protection. The EU on Thursday barely addressed the question of how to provide this. The headline that emerged from the summit was that Europe would triple the budget of Operation Triton, which was launched last year to patrol the Mediterranean Sea, replacing the heroic Italian naval effort known as Mare Nostrum.  Many countries, including Ireland and the UK, yesterday rushed to commit naval vessels and other equipment to Triton. But there is a crucial difference between Triton and Mare Nostrum: the latter's main goal was to save lives, while the former seems designed primarily to choke off smugglers.  Earlier this week, the head of Frontex, the EU border agency that oversees Triton, stated explicitly that the operation's goal was not to save lives. Who could doubt that cracking down on smugglers is important? But it is only one of the things that must be done - and if the EU only does this, it will cause more harm than good.  Leaving North Africa alone to deal with the entire refugee burden from conflicts like those in Syria and Eritrea not only could destabilise governments there, but is certain to make it harder to secure their co-operation in the EU's anti-smuggling efforts.  First principle  The EU needs to make sure that its first principle in the Mediterranean is saving lives, and that a robust search-and-rescue operation has this as its explicit mandate - an idea that was rejected on Thursday.  The argument against this is that it will serve as a ""pull factor"" for more asylum seekers to seek to cross the Mediterranean; but the moral cost of inaction is too high and there is little proof that the absence of a rescue operation has served to deter asylum seekers. In parallel, the EU must create greater capacity for protection - and safer avenues to access it. The simplest and fastest way to achieve this is by meaningfully expanding the number of refugees Europe agrees to resettle directly from UNHCR-run camps in Lebanon, Jordan, and elsewhere.  These are people who have been screened, pose no security threat and contribute to European economies. On Thursday, EU leaders could not even agree to admitting 5,000 resettled refugees in an orderly fashion; yet last year EU states took in several hundred thousand asylum seekers in a costly, disorderly way - by forcing most of them to attempt dangerous border crossings before hearing their cases. In addition to resettlement, EU states could issue, in large numbers, a variety of visas - humanitarian, student, work - and implement innovative means like private sponsorship of refugees, wherein NGOs and individuals take responsibility for assisting and supporting refugees after their arrival.  By providing asylumseekers with alternatives to illicit and dangerous routes, the EU would undermine the smugglers' business model.  Meanwhile, showing greater generosity towards those fleeing life-threatening conflicts would allow the EU not only to meet its legal and moral obligations, but also to lay a more solid foundation for partnership with African countries - co-operation that will be indispensable to choking off smugglers and traffickers.  If the EU merely tries to close off the unsafe, illegal routes to Europe without opening up legal ones, then it will be shunned by its counterparts. The EU also needs to revisit the linchpin of its common European asylum system - the idea that the country in which an asylum seeker first arrives is responsible for both processing and hosting him or her.  Untenable  This approach has proven untenable and has sown profound distrust and anger among EU member states. Southern states feel understandably aggrieved that they are on the front lines; Sweden and Germany in particular, where the majority of asylum seekers ultimately settle, correctly believe their burden is disproportionate.  Meanwhile, the majority of member states take on few if any refugees - the UK has accepted just 143 Syrians.  Without a truly common European approach to the issue, and in the absence of mutually beneficial co-operation with Africa, the crisis will only get worse.  Among the victims will be not only those swallowed by the Mediterranean, but also Europe's ability to uphold the rule of law. Political extremism already is growing in much of Europe; we cannot give it another boost through craven inaction. Peter D Sutherland is UN special representative for migration and development",1
The Irish Times,Apr-25,2017,"April 25, 2017",Shrinking stock market cuts the options for investors; The number of public companies in the US has more than halved overthe past 20 years,"The US stock market may be the biggest and most prestigious in the world, but more and more companies are choosing to ignore it, which has major consequences for global investors. The number of publicly traded US companies has more than halved over the past 20 years, according to a recent Credit Suisse report, The Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks. The report, written by the firm's head of global financial strategies, acclaimed behavioural finance author Michael Mauboussin, notes that there are now fewer listed companies than there were in 1976, despite the fact that the US economy has tripled in size over the same period.  The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, established in 1974 to reflect the country's 5,000 or so stocks, now has only 3,618 components, fewer than half 1996's peak levels. This is a peculiarly American phenomenon. Looking at 13 other developed markets, Mauboussin found that the number of public companies has risen by about 50 per cent since 1996. In theory the US should have more than 9,500 listings today, the report estimates, meaning there is now a yawning listing gap of more than 5,800 companies. Between 1976 and 2000, an average of 282 companies went public each year. Again, the peak was in 1996, when there were 706 initial public offerings (IPOs). Last year, that number had dwindled to just 105.  Today's companies are waiting a lot longer to go public. It's notable that Twitter, for example, waited until it was worth $14 billion (EUR 13.1 billion) before going public; Snapchat owner Snap waited until it had secured a valuation of about $25 billion; Facebook was worth more than $100 billion before it finally went public in 2012.  In contrast, internet darling Netscape was valued at about $1.5 billion when it went public in 1995, just over a year after being founded. The average market capitalisation of companies going public today is almost $7 billion, more than four times larger than 1996's average valuations.  Higher visibility So what's going on? The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which resulted in increased regulations and higher costs for companies going public, is likely a contributory factor deterring smaller, less profitable companies. However, the ""trend toward delisting was firmly in place"" years before new regulations were implemented, Mauboussin notes. In truth, going public has always been a hassle for companies, what with having to deal with quarterly earnings releases, activist shareholders and higher visibility that can catalyse political pressures. Previously, companies had no choice: if you wanted to raise money you had to go public.  Today, the need for capital is less pressing. Facebook, for example, generated $1.6 million in sales per employee last year, while Amazon generated $136 billion of sales using $19 billion in invested capital. More importantly, the companies that do need extra capital can find it in private markets. Late last year, Airbnb raised $850 million in capital. This private capital raising allowed employees to sell $200 million of stock. A total of 155 private US companies are valued at more than $1 billion; their combined market capitalisation is $585 billion.  Most of these so-called unicorns would have gone public 20 years ago, says Mauboussin. Now, they don't need to bother.  There are more than 3,000 US private equity firms. They manage about $825 billion in assets, up from $80 billion in 1996. Two of the largest companies - the Carlyle Group and KKR - each have more than 720,000 employees in their portfolio companies - and that's not including Walmart. That's more than any US listed company. Public companies are also very willing to pay big bucks for private companies, as evidenced by the likes of Google and Facebook snapping up substantial targets WhatsApp, Nest and Instagram. The continued decline in the number of listed companies means the US market, which accounts for 53 per cent of global stock market capitalisation, is changing. Industries are more concentrated. Today's listed companies are bigger, older firms with higher profit margins and a ""greater propensity to return cash to shareholders"", whether via dividends or through share buybacks. Instead of raising money to grow, companies are using the stock market to return cash to shareholders.  'Major consequences' The shrinking stock market has ""major consequences"" for ordinary investors. First , they no longer have the same access to fast-growing companies, many of which are now confined to venture capitalists.  With companies waiting longer to go public, it's becoming almost impossible to capture the upside of stocks compared with previous generations of investors. Mauboussin notes that Amazon was just three years old and valued at $625 million when it listed; anyone who bought at the time would have made 565 times their money. Google went public six years after its founding at a value of $29 billion, resulting in a 20-fold share price increase. Facebook was eight when it listed and valued at $110 billion; investors have made 3.7 times their money, and it is ""virtually impossible"" for Facebook investors to ever earn Amazon-like returns. Furthermore, analysts are examining fewer and older stocks; markets are increasingly dominated by institutional managers; individual investors are receding in importance - it all means markets are more efficient and informed. Gaining an ""edge"" in older, well-established companies is ""likely more difficult than it is in young businesses with uncertain outlooks"". This increased market efficiency may partly explain the rapid decline in direct ownership of stocks by individuals. Instead ordinary investors are plumping for indexed or rule-based strategies via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which began gaining in popularity around the time the population of listed stocks started falling. The explosion in ETFs - there were 658 US ETFs last year, compared with just one in 1993 - has given investors an alternative to buying a specific stock, says Mauboussin. What can be done to arrest the trend? Mauboussin doesn't tackle this question, although the options appear limited.  There will probably be talk of reduced regulation, although this alone is unlikely to tempt companies that can easily tap private markets for capital. One possibility is that well-established shareholder rights and corporate governance procedures will be gradually overturned. Indeed, this process may already be under way. Facebook and Google have both created classes of shares that weaken the power of shareholders. Snapchat parent Snap recently went further, issuing shares in in its recent IPO that carried no voting rights, an unprecedented move that alarmed experts in corporate governance. Shareholders may baulk at the suggestion that their rights might be diluted, but they might equally be displeased at the prospect of an investing universe that continues to shrink and their money being increasingly funnelled into a narrowing basket of stocks. In any case, it remains to be seen whether such a move would entice more companies into going public.  With private markets so buoyant, companies may continue to see public markets as a hassle they can do without. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-26,2008,"April 26, 2008",China and the Dalai Lama,"  YESTERDAY'S NEWS that the Chinese government is to reopen talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama about Tibet is welcome and timely. It came as Chinese leaders were meeting a delegation of European Union leaders in Beijing, thereby acknowledging deep international concern on the issue. Even though talks on Tibet have been conducted sporadically and to no great effect before they collapsed in 2006 their revival now will relieve political pressure on the Olympic Games, and will not be as easy to sideline as before because of expectations that movement can and should be made. The Chinese announcement repeated its previous allegations that the Dalai Lama should stop ""splitting the motherland, instigating violence and disrupting the Olympics"". He denies them vehemently, saying he accepts China's territorial integrity and seeks autonomy not separation, advocates peaceful protest and wants to see the Olympics proceed smoothly. It has suited Beijing to portray the Tibetan leader in such a hostile light because of a wave of nationalist protest in China over potential disruption of the games. Their success is a matter of great pride for Chinese people and any such threats are deeply resented. But their leaders have correctly read the international mood demanding a political initiative and their decision should defuse an increasingly fraught confrontation. It will help greatly if these talks can get under way promptly. They were immediately welcomed by French, German, British and other EU leaders, as by the US, all of whom have brought up the issue of human rights and were increasingly under pressure to do something real about it. They should encourage the Dalai Lama's representatives to negotiate on a principled but realistic agenda, as well as showing greater understanding of Chinese fears about Tibet. But this is a difficult and uncertain negotiation. The Tibetan demands for cultural recognition, economic and social equality in the face of extensive Han Chinese migration and economic domination and relaxation of harsh repression, must be addressed properly if the talks are to be meaningful. A vast gulf separates attitudes on both sides, since most Chinese regard the Tibetan protests as unjustified and cannot understand the resentment and bitterness directed against them. With skill and foresight it may be possible to capitalise on the international attention given the issue this year. That will take a sensitive yet firm approach from outsiders.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-26,2013,"April 26, 2013",Steering RT\x88 through the most turbulent era in media history; RT\x88 director-general Noel Curran says the threat to public service broadcasting should not be underestimated,"In the RT\xDE%ojr studio on launch day, there are milkshakes, puppets and hula hoops. Brendan O'Connor is among the grown-ups enlisted to read stories to pre-schoolers, while Minister for Children Frances Fitzgerald, dressed in bright colours, reminisces with RT\xDE%o executives about the more innocent days of Mr Ed, the Talking Horse.  Noel Curran, father to two daughters aged one and three, predicts RT\xDE%ojr will make Christmas ""a little easier for me this year"" and says the channel's advent has created ""a fantastic buzz"" around RT\xDE%o. Not every day has been a ticker-tape-parade day in the two years since Curran took the job of RT\xDE%o director-general. Few developments at Montrose have had adult executives waving cards illustrated with sunshine and rainbows, as the RT\xDE%ojr shindig did.  The twin editorial scandals - the costly A Mission to Prey libel and Tweetgate - garnered the most headlines, but running alongside the investigations, resignations and Oireachtas committee hearings, there was a financial quagmire to climb out of, digital terrestrial television (DTT) to launch and a five-year blueprint for its future funding to complete.  Financial hurdles ""RT\xDE%o has had a pretty turbulent 12 to 18 months,"" says Curran, speaking to The Irish Times two days later. ""Any one of those issues - the editorial, the financial, the strategy review, DTT - under normal circumstances would have taken up your year. To have all of them come together made things particularly difficult. But the message I'm trying to get across to staff is that we have dealt with each one of them."" It's not quite over. Lawyers for presidential candidate Se\xDE\xEFn Gallagher have been in contact about that Frontline tweet - ""it's in that legal arena"". There are still financial hurdles, not least of which is the decimated state of the television advertising market. Last Friday, the board of RT\xDE%o had its first glance at the accounts for 2012, a year in which its deficit exceeded \xE1EUR \xB560 million.  Much of this relates to the redundancy payments made in a bid to get as many staff as possible out the door, but the commercial revenue numbers are still unlikely to make soothing bedtime reading. Next month, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will pass along its recommendations on the future for public service media funding to Minister for Communications Pat Rabbitte.  In RT\xDE%o's submission to the BAI's review, it signals its willingness to ""countenance things we have never countenanced before"", such as opening up its Montrose campus to technology and production companies and forming new types of commercial partnerships. For Curran, the debate pivots on one simple question. ""People are going to face a choice, as multinational companies increasingly gain a foothold, as audiences increasingly diversify, as commercial income remains uncertain. Do you want a national public service broadcaster or not?"" he asks.  Content rationale ""And if you do, it's going to have to be properly funded, particularly in the middle of a commercial recession. If there is additional public funding available, we have shown in the document to the BAI what we would do with that additional funding, and I have indicated publicly that we are prepared to look at our commercial funding - but only if there are comparative increases in public funding."" There are a few big ""ifs"" in there. But the stakes are equally large. ""I don't know what will be in the BAI report and I don't know what the Government's reaction will be. But no one should underestimate the scale of the threat [to public service media]."" Earlier this month, RT\xDE%o published a pre-emptive strike of a report it commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers that worked out that for every \xE1EUR \xB51 it takes in licence fee income, it contributes \xE1EUR \xB52 to the economy (\xE1EUR \xB52.09 to be precise).  The report makes for slightly curious reading, and not just because it explains multiplier effects by citing the organic yoghurts purchased by Montrose employees at the nearby Merrion Centre. It's odd because its focus on RT\xDE%o's place at the centre of a creative industry matrix seems to suggest that the rationale for maintaining a strong public service broadcaster is an economic one. Is it? ""No, the rationale for public service broadcasting is a content one. It has to be. That's what public service broadcasting is about. Personally, it's the reason I'm here. I'm interested in content. I think what the report was saying, what I hope it said, is that beyond that there is a wider economic impact as well."" And though the PwC report highlighted that the licence fee is ""comparatively low"" (compared to other European countries with a licence fee), RT\xDE%o is not necessarily angling for an increase in the household rate.  'Massive turnaround' ""There is a whole range of different things that can be done around public funding,"" says Curran, citing potential adjustments to the BAI's Sound and Vision fund, the option of higher-priced licences for commercial premises and the chance of a more efficient collection mechanism via Rabbitte's proposed broadcasting charge. Curran describes both the fall in headcount at RT\xDE%o over the last four years from 2,300 to just below 1,800 and the \xE1EUR \xB5100 million drop in operating costs since 2008 as a ""massive turnaround"" on the state-of-play that greeted him when he first claimed the DG's corner office. ""When I was offered the job [in October 2010], I was outside of RT\xDE%o, and at that stage the forecast for the following year was a deficit of \xE1EUR \xB56 million. And I thought, '\xE1EUR \xB56 million, we can pull that back',"" he says. ""By the time I joined in February 2011, in my very first day in the job, I was told that the forecast for that year was minus \xE1EUR \xB530 million.""  The slashing stepped up, and the deficit wound up at just under \xE1EUR \xB517 million for that year. Breaking even, or thereabouts, in 2013 is now Curran's hope, though the market is still ""very, very difficult"". The DG gig has required far more proficiency with scissors than he could ever have expected. Shouldn't he be getting paid more than Ryan Tubridy for his trouble? (Curran is paid the semi-state salary cap of \xE1EUR \xB5250,000.) He sighs. ""Listen, the last couple of years have been challenging, but they have been challenging for everybody. I love broadcasting, I love the media, I love journalism, television, radio. I'm very much in that digital space,"" he says. ""You get to be director-general, so I'm not complaining. I'm well paid."" The ""overpaying"" of its top presenters, meanwhile, ""was our fault, not their fault"". Bringing star pay closer to earth might be important for public relations as well as the bottom line, but crisis mode hasn't blinded RT\xDE%o to the need to make more strategic changes, including the introduction of the advertising-free RT\xDE%ojr (""a very big public service statement by us"") and the beefing up of quasi-channel RT\xDE%o News Now.  Speed of change ""We need to keep moving forward. Even in the middle of a recession, you need to start thinking ahead, you need to start positioning yourself,"" he says. ""The temptation is to just batten down the hatches, cut, cut, cut. And you do need to cut costs, but you also need to follow where your audience is going and where the market is going."" Where the media market is going, nobody knows for sure. Those frightened by the speed of change may be comforted by Nielsen statistics that show the average number of minutes Irish people spend watching television daily is increasing.  Those who argue against sitting still with a cup of tea, a biscuit and an Angelus-like glaze note that traffic to RT\xDE%o's mobile and tablet apps outstripped page impressions on RT\xDE%o.ie in the first quarter. ""That is phenomenal,"" he says. The challenge of making the transition to digital is ""a shared problem"" across the media sector, Curran stresses.  ""The difficulty we all face in the digital space is that we're in a commercial crisis; the advertising industry has not fully got to grips with mobile and everyone expects everything for free.  Different league ""In the case of RT\xDE%o, people already pay,"" he swiftly adds, ""but elsewhere, people are equating freedom of expression with free content and the two are not the same."" At one end of the spectrum there is ""the massive democratisation of the media, which is fantastic"", with bloggers who are ""not in it for the money"", and at the other end of the scale, there are ""these massive multinational companies - huge companies - making fortunes"".  In the middle lie Irish media companies that are ""almost expected to be giving it for free, and yet they have to produce the content"". It is the nub of a lot of issues: tech giants such as Google and platform providers like BSkyB and Liberty Global are in a different league, earnings-wise,from the companies investing in content. Sky, which sells local advertising on 23 channels, is something of a bogeyman for RT\xDE%o. ""Sky, they do some investments, but compared to what they take out of the country, it's minimal,"" Curran says. ""They're taking, we believe, more than \xE1EUR \xB5500 million out of this market. They're absolutely huge."" RT\xDE%o's competitors, however, look at their neighbour in the squeezed middle and conclude that its dual-funded model isn't exactly helping them. Their stances vary - some call for greater licence fee top-slicing through Sound and Vision; all wish RT\xDE%o would get off their commercial lawn.  Shifting the balance TV3 chief executive David McRedmond has described RT\xDE%o's deficits as illegal State aid, while the National Newspapers of Ireland group claims advertising on RT\xDE%o's website should be banned, as its online ""land-grabbing"" activities are ""simply not appropriate"". Curran believes the NNI's argument is flawed. ""RT\xDE%o, like everybody else, makes very little in advertising online - like, very little. We are not the problem here. People access newspaper sites for wildly different things. They access it for the opinion, they access it for the named columnists. We are a very different service."" As for the broader complaint that RT\xDE%o is too big and distortive a commercial player, Curran sounds conciliatory and pragmatic. He notes that RT\xDE%o would have more financial security and a clearer sense of purpose if a greater chunk of its funding was from the licence fee (or its replacement), not advertising. ""I probably haven't said this as baldly before, but we are happy to see the balance of commercial and public funding alter. But we need some security."" Shifting the balance in the other direction makes little sense, partly because commercial income, notwithstanding potential new revenue streams, is now so much trickier to come by and partly because this would dilute its public service identity. ""If RT\xDE%o is pushed down that route where public funding is taken away from us, or just gradually eroded - which is what's happening now every year because there is no inflationary increase in the licence fee - then you just push RT\xDE%o more and more into the commercial space,"" says Curran. ""You just push RT\xDE%o more and more into the space occupied by TV3. And that means you lose more of that unique value of what a public service broadcaster offers."" Each time Minister for Communications Pat Rabbitte mentions licence fee reform, it sparks a broader commentary, often hostile, on why we have public funding in the media at all.  Yet, as the Minister frequently points out, the media business is not just any business, and no other media organisation has statutory obligations anywhere close to those of RT\xDE%o. The public appears to know it. ""All of our research shows that while audiences will complain about elements of RT\xDE%o, we have huge viewer loyalty and huge viewer trust. People turn to RT\xDE%o, they turn to our output. We see that again and again,"" says Curran. On whether Ireland still wants a public service broadcaster ""that does a range of things that no one else does"", he answers his own question. ""I think the answer has to be yes. And if the answer is yes, then you say, how do you properly fund that public service broadcaster? And we're very open to asking what else do we need to do for that funding, and how else do we need to change.""",0
The Irish Times,Apr-27,2020,"April 27, 2020","Irish racing anxiously waiting for green light to resume; Irish racecourses are losing EUR 5 million for every month closed, estimates indicate","Ireland's racecourses are facing an economic ""perfect storm"" that won't be fixed by any resumption of racing behind closed doors. Whether or not the government eases social restrictions imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, or extends them past the current May 5th deadline, is expected to be announced later this week and racing is anxiously awaiting news of when it might be able to resume. Racing here, along with all sports, has been cancelled for over a month due to the coronavirus emergency. Germany is expected to allow a resumption of racing next week, and France is set to do the same a week later, so there are growing hopes within the sector here that action can start again in some form behind closed doors. It is unclear what any resumption date might be although the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association has suggested June 1st could be the earliest realistic option.  Whenever it happens the sport's ruling body, Horse Racing Ireland, continues to have a ""racing ready"" policy and could potentially be able to stage fixtures within a week of government giving a green light.  Such a development will be welcome news across all sectors but won't prevent Ireland's 26 racecourses from facing an uncertain financial outlook. With mass gatherings of over 5,000 cancelled until September, there will be no spectators going racing while sponsorship and other income streams are also hit. Betting shops  The closure of betting shops, both here and in UK, means there is also an impact on media rights income even if racing does resume.  ""If you look at a Deloitte report we did in 2018, it showed the income of racecourses back in 2016 was EUR 52 million. Realistically that's up to EUR 60 million now. So for every month closed, racecourses are losing EUR 5 million. ""Even after a resumption there will still be a significant loss of revenue. So if you look at a Galway, or Punchestown or Curragh or any track that has good commercial revenue on top of media rights, if you go behind closed doors you don't replace that revenue. ""You lose some of your race meeting costs but not enough to compensate. It's a perfect storm for racecourses. They've literally lost all of their income,"" said the HRI's chief executive Brian Kavanagh. On top of commercial income, which also includes catering and a slice of on-course betting turnover, the vital media rights money, believed to be worth about EUR 30 million a year to tracks, is cut while betting shops are closed. Kavanagh said on Sunday that racecourses and on-course bookmakers, who aren't allowed attend behind closed doors fixtures, are two sectors to the forefront of HRI's concerns about how they will emerge from the current crisis. Any first step back behind closed doors would be a welcome step although the HRI boss wouldn't speculate on a potential resumption date despite encouraging signs recently in France and Germany.  ""We're in the hands of government on this,"" he said before stressing that behind closed doors fixtures are very different events to normal meetings. Ten such meetings were run here before racing stopped on March 24th. ""They are not race meetings as you would traditionally know them. They are effectively being run for the industry, for horses to have an outlet to run. They're not even sporting events almost. ""There is a work aspect to racing, an industry aspect, that is different from other sports.  ""It's really a matter for the medical authorities so I'm not going to speculate one way or the other. The focus is on the bigger national health picture at the moment,"" Kavanagh said.  HRI meeting  The board of Horse Racing Ireland is due to meet today and a government announcement on restrictions will be made later this week ahead of the May 5th deadline. The Minister for Health, Simon Harris, already appears to have tried to dampen expectations of any extensive relaxation however, warning there won't be a ""big bang moment"" in relation to easing social restrictions.  Warning  Kavanagh also warned yesterday about the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on other racing sectors such as small trainers and those involved in bloodstock sales which have been disrupted.  ""If you look at breeders, and the various breeze-up sales around Europe, 85 to 90 per cent of horses sold at those sales are in Ireland or are Irish horses. Holders of that stock are looking at value diminishing in front of their eyes. If you have a sharp two year old, and you're looking at selling that in July or August, you've missed the boat,"" he said.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-27,2020,"April 27, 2020",Next steps for companies; Coronavirus: business preparations,"The Government has not yet outlined its plans for gradually exiting the lockdown, but it will happen at some stage and it is time for companies to consider what steps they need to take to reopen. This is complicated in all cases, and particularly for businesses which have the public on their premises. All have a responsibility to safeguard their workforce and also those entering or leaving the premises.  The central issue for many companies will be social distancing - between members of their workforce and, where relevant, the public. This will require significant reorganisation in most workplaces. Each will have its own particular challenges. Social distancing is necessary not only to abide by the guidelines, but also for companies to persuade employees and their customers that they are providing a safe environment. As both groups will be nervous, this is business critical. Employees need to feel safe in their workplace. And consumers will only return to shops and other businesses when they are assured that all steps are being taken to reduce any risk. In some businesses change will be far-reaching. Companies and their employees will have a responsibility to keep abreast of public health advice. Some issues are uncertain. Should we wear masks in some situations? Is it useful to take staff temperatures? If so, how are data protection rules adhered to? How are visitors managed? In retail settings, the grocery stores have led the way, but other shops will have their own challenges. The hospitality sector faces particular difficulties. Employers and their staff need to work together as flexibly as possible. In some cases it may make sense for staff to work from home - and some may need to, unless creches and schools reopen. Businesses may now realise that staff can work flexibly and efficiently at home. Special arrangements may also have to be found for vulnerable people. And all sides will need to realise that rapid testing, contact tracing and isolation may disrupt both companies and their employees, but are a vital part of keeping people as safe as possible as the economy slowly returns to life.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-28,2017,"April 28, 2017",The problems created by inflation's ups and downs,"Inflation has gone out of fashion in Ireland as the price level today is the same as it was in 2008. Looking at the last nine years, we saw a fall in prices in 2009 of 4.5 per cent; thereafter prices have very slowly returned to their pre-crisis level. While inflation is traditionally seen as damaging economic welfare, this low rate of inflation has brought its own problems. From 1973 through to the start of EMU in 1999, inflation averaged 8 per cent a year. However, the rate of inflation was extremely volatile over this period, especially in the 1970s and the early 1980s. For example, in 1975 and 1981 the inflation rate was over 20 per cent.  This high and volatile rate of inflation imposed significant costs on society. For example, it meant that employees who agreed to what they thought was a real pay increase for the coming year could find their purchasing power actually reduced by a surprise increase in inflation. Similarly employers could find themselves out on a limb if inflation suddenly fell. For savers a surprise increase in inflation acted as a major tax on what they had put by for retirement. In the early 1970s, the blame for the high rate of inflation was put on unduly generous pay increases and an ""excessive"" rise in other domestic costs. However, by 1976 the underlying cause of the problem was identified: the combination of a fixed exchange rate with sterling and the very lax monetary policy regime pursued by the Bank of England. Irish prices followed those in the UK which, in turn, were affected by the continuous fall in the value of sterling. While the role of monetary policy in causing excessive inflation was identified, it took some time to move to a regime that would moderate the inflationary pressures. In 1976 consideration was given to revaluing the Irish pound against sterling but this was seen to be too radical a departure. The fiscal crisis in the first half of the 1980s also discouraged action to bring inflation under control. From the mid-1980s onwards, inflation gradually fell back to an average of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent a year over the period 1985 to 1999.  One of the costs to society of the uncertain inflation rate was that real interest rates - the difference between the nominal interest rate and the rate of inflation - were very high. Over the period 1979 to 1999, real interest rates in Ireland averaged two percentage points higher than in Germany. As a result, financing investment in Ireland was much more expensive than in Germany, significantly hampering growth. One manifestation of the resulting underinvestment was that the stock of housing in Ireland in the 1990s was too low for the growing population. The Euro regime, which began in 1999, was designed to produce a stable and low inflation rate of 2 per cent a year. The combination of a low and predictable rate of inflation was designed to improve the welfare of Euro area residents. For Ireland the new regime delivered in terms of the average rate of inflation - exactly 2 per cent a year between 1999 and 2016. However, while the inflation rate, averaged over the full period, has been on target, it has not prevented the recent experience of falling or very low inflation.  The absence of inflation since 2008, reflecting the effects of the great recession, has had significant negative welfare effects through a range of channels. In the face of falling output and zero inflation, the appropriate response for the European Central Bank was to cut interest rates. However, interest rates were already low before the crisis so that the cut in rates when the recession began was wholly inadequate to restore inflation to 2 per cent. Instead the ECB has had to use a range of other less effective measures to try and restore inflation.  In addition to rendering monetary policy less effective, low or falling inflation has other welfare costs. For example, contracts for rents signed in the boom assumed inflation, with upward-only rent reviews. When prices fell, fixed rents caused mayhem. After the recent experience of a prolonged period of zero inflation, some leading economists, such as former International Monetary Fund chief economist Olivier Blanchard, have suggested the ECB should target a higher rate of inflation of 4 per cent. This would leave much more room to cut interest rates in times of crisis and lessen the chances of future problems. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-29,2005,"April 29, 2005",Cuts still on agenda at An Post despite EUR 7m profit,"An Post is still seeking up to 1,500 redundancies, a price rise of 25 per cent and further work practice changes despite announcing a pretax profit for 2004 of EUR 7 million yesterday. Donal Curtin, the company's chief executive, said An Post was ""not out of the woods yet"". He said an increase in the price of a stamp from 48 to 60 cent would help the company to complete its rescue plan. 20050428231108 ""Despite the success of strict control measures, the An Post cost base remains too high and substantial cuts are essential through headcount reductions, efficiencies, work practice changes and the implementation of the automation agreement,"" he said. The company strongly emphasised that, while turnover was up 5.8 per cent to EUR 750 million, major structural issues still had to be tackled. The decision not to pay the terms of Sustaining Progress to its 10,000 staff saved the company about EUR 20 million in 2004. The company also revealed it made EUR 7 million in profits from postal activity during referenda and elections in 2004. Despite this, the 2004 performance is a marked improvement on 2003. In 2003, it posted an operating loss of EUR 42 million, whereas in 2004 it has managed an operating profit of EUR 1.7 million. Its position was also helped by property disposals during the year of EUR 5.2 million. Despite this turnaround, Mr Curtin warned that An Post's future prospects ""remain uncertain"". Operating costs in 2004 only fell slightly, from EUR 748 million to EUR 745 million. ""Mail volumes declined by 1.3 per cent, the second successive year, despite national economic growth of 5 per cent a year and an additional 80,000 new delivery points,"" he said. He said the problems at An Post were compounded by a continuing decline in the number of social welfare transactions taking place across the counter. He said the National Treasury Management Agency was also seeking to cut the fee An Post was paid for selling its savings products by 40 per cent. He said the industrial relations climate in An Post was ""resistant to change"". He said a recommendation from the Labour Court about collection and delivery would be crucial for the company. During negotiations on this, An Post management said they were seeking 1,000-1,500 redundancies. However, Mr Curtin said that, while headcount reductions were important, reducing the number of hours worked by employees at the company was also vital, particularly overtime. The 2004 annual report shows the number of employees fell from 11,918 to 11,440. The number of overtime hours also fell during the year. On the subject of service levels, Mr Curtin said he was not personally satisfied with the company's next-day-delivery performance, although he questioned the need for two surveys to be conducted in the area: one by An Post and another by ComReg, the regulatory body. Mr Curtin said it was difficult to think too far ahead until the deeper issues at the company were tackled, but he said An Post would be rolling out a new suite of financial products within 18 months. In relation to 2005, he said the company was trading slightly ahead of budget and turnover was on target. He said cost reduction was slightly ahead of forecasts at this point.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-29,2010,"April 29, 2010",European shares fall amid contagion anxiety,"EURO ZONE CRISIS:ANGELA MERKEL S call for talks on emergency rescue aid for Greece to be speeded up came as uncertainty over the plan whipped up turmoil on the markets, sending the euro down and the yield on short-term Greek debt as high as 38 per cent. European shares fell amid growing anxiety about the contagion impact from the crisis on other debt-reliant countries and Spain faced the prospect of higher borrowing costs after its credit rating was cut. The European Commission, however, said it saw no risk of contagion. You cannot seriously establish any comparison between the situation in Greece and the situation in any euro area member, said the spokesman for economics commissioner Olli Rehn. With diplomatic and other European sources saying German resistance was the main stumbling block to progress in talks on a rescue, Dr Merkel advanced her position after demands for decisive action from the European Central Bank and the IMF. German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said Berlin s approval of its contribution to the aid package would be submitted to parliament by Friday week if talks on the plan were finalised in the next few days. There would also be a fast-track procedure to release the money quickly, he added.  The approval of the German parliament remains uncertain at this point, but we reckon German participation in the Greek aid package will eventually win support, said analysts at Citigroup. Greek 10-year bonds remained lower yesterday, the yield rising 0.43 percentage points at one stage to 10.48 per cent on concern about the EU/IMF rescue plan. The premium investors charge over German debt to hold Greek 10-year paper peaked at more 10 percentage points but later tightened to 8.25 percentage points. Having soared to 38 per cent, the market priced the yield on Greek two-year paper about 17.35 late yesterday. However, an opinion poll for Mega TV in Greece suggested most Greeks disapproved of their government s move to seek aid. Almost 61 per cent of 1,400 people surveyed said they opposed the decision. The euro dropped to a one-year low against the dollar, reaching $1.3117 at one point, while shares in Britain, Germany and France dropped between 0.3 per cent and 1.5 per cent, Portuguese shares dropped 1.9 per cent and Spanish shares lost 3 per cent. Following its downgrade of Greek debt to junk status and a two-notch cut of its rating on Portuguese debt, Standard Poor s (SP) cut its assessment of Spanish debt by one notch to AA. SP has a negative outlook on Spain, reflecting the possibility of further downgrade if its budgetary position underperforms to a greater extent than anticipated. The yield on two-year Spanish debt rose 0.10 percentage points to 2.19 per cent and the yield on Portugal s two-year note was little changed at 5.30 per cent. While the latest downgrade was seen as a sign of contagion spreading from Greece, SP s junk rating on Greece drew a testy response yesterday from the European Commission. Who are Standard Poor s anyway? asked Mr Rehn s spokesman. The spokeswoman for internal markets commissioner Michel Barnier said the EU executive would continue to observe very closely what s going on and planned to introduce new rules to regulate the agencies later this year.  We would expect that when credit rating agencies assess the Greek risk, they take due account of the fundamentals of the Greek economy and the support package prepared by the ECB, the IMF and the commission, she said. The response of the European authorities to the Greek crisis drew a withering critique yesterday from Alessandro Leipold, a former acting director of the IMF s European division. In a paper for the Lisbon Council think-tank, Mr Leipold said the assistance programme has been severely mishandled by European policymakers, with a meandering strategy and poor communication , threatening to undermine European unity itself.  The time of muddling through must end, he wrote. First and foremost of these is rapidity of response. Approaching official support as an ultima ratio is misguided. Any further procedural delays should be forestalled by swift provision of bridge financing. ",1
The Irish Times,Apr-03,2021,"April 3, 2021",Think differently; Outdoor dining,"While many businesses are suffering deeply as a result of lockdown, the hospitality sector is surely among the hardest hit. It needs help like never before and it is in all our interests to ensure help is on hand. Not least because hospitality, in its many forms, is responsible for hundreds of thousands of jobs and injects almost EUR 10 billion into local economies each year.  The news that the Government is to invest EUR 17 million in supports to help create ""European-style"" outdoor dining spaces ahead of a crucial - although uncertain - summer season is therefore welcome. However, something more is required. Under the new Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme, businesses can avail of grants of up to EUR 4,000 for permanent weatherproofing including parasols, electric heaters, wind breakers and outdoor seating. Funding of up to EUR 200,000 is on the table for local authorities to spend on weatherproofing. The scheme aims ""to transform appropriate outdoor spaces within our cities and towns [into] welcoming, vibrant places that will help support economic recovery"".  The financial assistance will go some way to support businesses devastated by the pandemic. But invention is as important as investment. Restaurants, bars and cafes must be encouraged to think differently and to use the footpaths near their premises, even if on-street parking spaces are sacrificed as a result. Streets in the commercial centre of every town and city must be pedestrianised and casual trading encouraged.  In short, there needs to be less heed paid to the needs of cars and more to those who access our lived spaces on foot. We know there is an appetite for pedestrianisation. It was demonstrated in a trial run by Dublin City Council involving streets off Grafton Street last summer. All told, 96 per cent of those who took part in the trial said it improved their experience while a sizeable majority favoured pedestrianising streets permanently. This is the way forward. The pandemic has given us a chance to reimagine our urban spaces. It must not be squandered. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-30,2005,"April 30, 2005",UK contest may be dull but outcome is important for peace process,"The outcome of the British general election and the mandate given to the next British government is of importance to Ireland, even if the contest appears not very exciting, writes Martin Mansergh. Neighbouring and partner governments generally prefer ""the devil they know"", rather than having to build up relationships with a new and unfamiliar team. Albert Reynolds as taoiseach was glad to see John Major back as prime minister in 1992. Regardless of ideology or European affiliations, it is doubtful if there are many in the Oireachtas who would not prefer to see the Labour government of Tony Blair returned next week. 20050429212034 We have, of course, an interest in effective government abroad, able to take decisions. The change of government in 1997 in Britain was welcome here, because of expectations that Labour would be able to move the Northern Ireland peace process forward again and play a more positive role in the EU. The entire EU has an interest in a German government after elections next year being able to carry through the necessary reforms to restore its economy. If Tony Blair is returned for a third term with a comfortable but perhaps smaller majority, it will enable the partnership with Bertie Ahern to continue long enough to secure full implementation of the Belfast Agreement, provided the parties make that feasible. The two governments are also allies against EU corporate tax harmonisation. John Major's precarious Westminster situation gave the Ulster Unionists leverage to stave off serious political negotiations for three years. The large Labour majority since 1997, coupled with Tory party disarray, has meant that majority unionism, now with the DUP, has had no alternative but to deal with Blair. Revival of an opposition alliance with the Tories on the model of 1912-14 has not been a realistic or promising option. To be fair, bipartisanship on Northern Ireland at Westminster has been largely maintained. The Tories support the Belfast Agreement, which, after all, is largely built on the Framework Document of February 1995 put forward by John Major and John Bruton, who inherited a very advanced draft from the Reynolds/Spring administration. Traditional Tory security instincts would be similar to those volubly expressed by Justice Minister Michael McDowell. While no party in the Oireachtas outside of Sinn Fein disputes the vigour of his approach, its duplication from the other side of the water, unless equally applied to active loyalist paramilitaries who live exclusively under British jurisdiction as well as republican ones, might be a bit too much of a good thing. Ireland certainly has grounds to fear a Tory government from a European perspective. A Britain marginalised completely within the EU, or moved out to associate status, would be an unwelcome complication. As it is, British euro membership has been long-fingered, without, however, any obvious negative effects on Ireland. Gordon Brown's economic chauvinism focuses on France and Germany, and ignores Ireland's very positive experience. The basis of British Eurosceptic fears of a centralised and dirigiste European bureaucracy is in complete contradiction with the basis of French Euroscepticism, that sees in the EU constitution the triumph of neo-liberal ""Anglo-Saxon"" capitalism, shorn of social protections. Both caricatures cannot be true. In fact, neither are. The trump cards being deployed against Blair are of doubtful value. Many voters dislike or are unmoved by attempted exploitation of immigration for electoral gain. There is nothing surprising in the attorney general's initially hedged advice to Tony Blair on the legality of the Iraq war, and the issue has already been thrashed to death. Most people have long since concluded that the over-enthusiastic advocacy of the war in Iraq (in order to keep Britain close by the side of the US) stretched truthfulness to the limit. Whether it will deter Labour voters and make enough converts to the Liberal Democrats to compensate for their leader Charles Kennedy's muddle over his party's policy on higher taxes is uncertain. One winner may be further apathy. The more predictable and boring first-past-the-post system does not begin to give the British (and Northern Ireland) voter the power and range of choice of PR-STV. In Northern Ireland it is a matter of complete indifference here whether the Rev William McCrea or David Burnside wins South Antrim. Genuine pro-Agreement Ulster unionism is now thin on the ground, and there may be as much to hope from a DUP that does not have to look over its shoulder too much. Paisley taking office in or after his 80th year would outdo even the Pope. The spectacle of Lord Molyneaux and the Rev Martin Smyth backing DUP candidates is about as edifying as the spectacle of Tim Healy backing Sinn Fein in 1918 against his erstwhile colleagues in the Irish Parliamentary Party. Whether southern parties' solidarity with the SDLP impresses nationalist voters remains to be seen. The possible loss of any nationalist voice in the Westminster parliament should be a matter of some concern. A British government preoccupied with its EU and G8 presidencies will have less time for bilateral prime ministerial meetings on the interminable difficulties of a stalled Northern Ireland political process. A legitimate question that might be asked of the Sinn Fein leadership is why Gerry Adams was only able to undertake his recent initiative vis-a-vis the IRA so late. The often hardball and inflexible negotiating tactics employed since 1998 share a lot of responsibility for the political mess and loss of momentum that now exists, leaving much ground to be made up to regain trust. Unionism is under little pressure, and has succeeded for the moment in its objective of getting off the hook of having to share power with republicans. A conundrum to many people outside the North is why the anticipated winners in both communities deserve a large electoral reward. But it is in the nature of politics that any comfort zone won is shortlived. Pressure to make democratic politics work will shortly be resumed.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-30,2011,"April 30, 2011",Is the sun setting on Irish trade unionism?,"Union membership is dropping and workers pay and conditions are being cut. So, with May Day tomorrow, what does the trade-union movement mean for ordinary members? JIM RYAN, a middle manger in the Civil Service and a trade-union member, has heard most of the lame jokes about unions and public-sector workers. How many civil servants does it take to fix a light bulb? Twenty-three got a problem with that?Or what about this one? A civil servant goes to his doctor with a sleep problem. I get to sleep at night, says the civil servant. And mornings are okay, but I m having trouble dropping off in the afternoon.  Hardly thigh-slapping material. But it does, he says, reveal a greater truth about the wider perception of the heavily unionised public sector. I suppose it can be funny initially, says Ryan, who works in the Limerick office of the Revenue, but when you hear the 20th joke that all we do is drink tea all day it s a bit much.  Jokes are one thing, but Ryan, a member of the Public Service Executive Union, which represents middle managers, says civil servants are facing a new kind of hostility. In particular, he says, much of the media have the knives out for trade unions, attacking what they see as a vested interest clinging on to generous pensions, permanent jobs and privilege days while much of the private sector has been ravaged by job losses.  You get the feeling that we re to blame for everything, he says. But we ve been incredibly flexible. We re changing the way we work. Public services are being run at a much cheaper level. On top of that we ve had significant pay cuts. Many of us also have family members who have lost jobs, have big mortgages and are finding the going very tough.  For myself being part of a union has been crucial. Otherwise we d be looking at compulsory redundancies and further pay cuts. It s a vital safety blanket when things are going bad, but it s also a movement that s pragmatic and open to change.  THE ROLE of trade unions, and how they re regarded more generally, is weighing on the minds of union leaders and their members these days. Tomorrow is International Labour Day, or May Day, a holiday dedicated to recalling the social and economic achievements of the labour movement. In addition, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is drawing up a discussion document on how to modernise the movement and improve its image. Trade unions are at an uncertain crossroads. Union members pay and conditions have been cut like never before. Public hostility towards industrial action in the public sector has been unprecedented. Against a backdrop where the number of union members has been falling, the trade-union movement faces inevitable questions about its influence and relevancy into the future. Just this week a senior union leader fretted publicly that attendance at branch meetings was falling away dramatically and warned of an increasing disconnect between the union and its members, with fewer people bothering to vote in crucial ballots.  Some branches are barely functioning; some find it impossible to appoint branch officers, says Philip King, general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland. Some are required to duplicate branch officerships. We have to be honest and truthful about this.  In addition, a new report funded by the Labour Relations Commission has concluded that trade unions have been hit hard by the recession. The sheer scale of the downturn meant unions could do little more than acquiesce with priorities set out by management, the report found. The position of unions was weakened further by subdued and compliant employees, fearful for their jobs, pensions and livelihoods . Unions also face a dilemma, according to the report s co-author Prof Paul Teague, of Queen s University Belfast. If they go too far and are too compliant they lose the support of members, he said at a recent event. If they are not fully engaged they miss an opportunity to influence management plans. It is a careful balancing act.  TOM GERAGHTY is general secretary of the Public Service Executive Union. It represents about 10,000 members, mostly middle managers earning between EUR 40,000 and EUR 60,000 a year. Membership has dropped by about 500 over the past 12 months as a result of civil servants not being replaced. It s a worrying but not alarming development, he says.  No organisation can afford to lose large numbers, but at least we re not losing people who should be members. We estimate that around 90 per cent of middle managers in the public sector are part of our union.  He says that although pay cuts and greater flexibility have been difficult to stomach, the union has played a key role in protecting workers. If we weren t representing our members interests, then pay cuts and compulsory redundancies would be on the table. Our role has never changed, despite the state of the economy. Our job, and the reason people join us, is to balance the forces between the employer and employee. That doesn t change. That s a fundamental reason why people continue to be members of unions.  And what of accusations that unions are out of touch, trying to protect privileges that a bankrupt country simply can t afford? A review of the Croke Park agreement next month will show that hundreds of millions of euro has been taken out of the cost of running public services, says Geraghty. It s remarkable that you can do that and still have unions that co-operate with change.  The Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants represents about 3,000 high-ranking civil servants and managers. It has lost about 10 per cent of its members over the past year, also as a result of the recruitment embargo.  There have been huge changes in public services, though Joe Soap on the street doesn t always see it, says Dave Thomas, the association s general secretary. The recruitment of staff has been opened to include the private sector. Our members are taking on much more responsibility and introducing performance management . . . We try to take a pragmatic approach to all of these issues.  One union that boasts it is actually increasing members is the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which represents about 38,000 nurses across the public and private sectors. Anne Burke, a nurse manager with Galway University Hospital, says that, if anything, there has been an increase in membership of the union. I was at a branch meeting the other night and we asked ourselves, Why would you be a member of the union? The words that kept cropping up were safety net , security , advocacy . They re the reasons people are coming to join, to be part of a collective.  As well as the fear of another pay cut, she says, nurses are terrified that they will be held responsible for mistakes caused by understaffing on wards or cuts to healthcare. Many nurses are doing the job of two or three colleagues. When that happens there s a risk of more mistakes and being referred to a fitness-to-practise committee. So the union for us is like an insurance policy, because they represent us at those meetings.  The union s general secretary, Liam Doran, says it is these kinds of issues a safe working place, training, quality care for patients that predominate over issues like pay. This is despite the fact that nurses have had pay cuts of up to 35 per cent. Critics, however, are quick to point out that, through their involvement in social partnership, unions became part of the problem, securing ever-increasing and unsustainable wage increases that contributed to miring the country in debt.  I hold the view, says Doran, that unions were doing exactly what they were expected to do: secure decent pay increases for members and decent public services. We didn t force anyone into giving us 5 or 10 per cent pay increases. The employers were part of that as well.  MANY OTHER union leaders, however, acknowledge that they have been deeply damaged by social partnership. As well as being perceived to be too close to the Government, many seemingly lost touch with the roots of their branches. The industrial-relations expert Prof William Roche of University College Dublin says unions are facing a difficult period of transition. They have lost the access and influence they once had and won t be getting them back anytime soon.  It is clear that unions, especially in the private sector, are very much on the back foot, he says. Listening to delegates at recent agms, there s been a lot of talk about holding on to the Croke Park agreement . If that goes belly up, then they ll find themselves in an unprecedented position.  But it s not all negative. Unions also have a chance to get back to basics, says Roche, to reconnect and engage with members. Being free of social partnership could also help them to rediscover their roots as an energetic movement, grounded in a campaign for a just and fair society. All of this is likely to feed into a wide-ranging review of how unions are organised, which is being finalised by senior members of the trade-union movement. Although numbers of trade-union members have been falling, the proportion of the public sector that s unionised remains very high. With more than 800,000 members, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is still the island s largest civil-society organisation.  I certainly wouldn t write off the trade-union movement, says Jim Ryan in Limerick. If they weren t there for us, I wonder how many public-sector workers would be made redundant, and for what? And how low would the minimum wage be? During the good times people feel they don t need to be part of a union. The more time goes on, I think, people will realise that we need unions now more than ever. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-04,2011,"April 4, 2011",The leaving of Charlestown,"In the second of a series on Irish towns affected by the downturn, CARL O'BRIENvisits Charlestown, Co Mayo. As more and more locals stream out of nearby Knock airport, those left behind are hopeful business - and life - will return. SOMETIMES, AS HE sits at the departure gate of Ireland West airport near Knock, Michael wonders how his life changed so quickly. Every lunchtime on Sunday he gets on Ryanair flight FR806 to Stansted. The weekdays are a blur of long, punishing hours working as a construction manager at a site on the outskirts of London. Then on Fridays, he rushes home to Mayo to snatch a few hours with his wife and son. All too quickly, Sunday morning arrives and it begins all over again.  It s the only option this is the way the hammer has fallen, says Michael (50), who has been making the weekly commute to the UK for the past year. I have a child who s eight. Every day he s developing and you re missing out on those crucial years. It puts enormous pressure on the family unit and your relationships. For me, the airport is an umbilical cord. It s the only way I can see my wife and son.  Michael is not alone. On a Sunday afternoon at the departures gate, there are dozens of other commuting emigrants waiting to head back to England or further afield. Around a third of those on today s flights are commuters: carpenters, builders, engineers, therapists, computer programmers. The atmosphere is sombre, with many having said goodbye to their partners and children earlier in the morning. Many are middle-aged parents who have no choice but to leave their families to keep up mortgage payments or cover the bills. They are a new kind of displaced emigrant, caught between making a living in one country and raising their families in another. Ross Cameron (31) is another waiting to head back to work. He s married with two children aged three and five. He s been commuting to London each week since his bathroom supply company folded almost a year ago. He misses his family terribly.  You get home at midnight on a Friday and the kids are asleep. You don t have a drink because you want to be up in time for them in the morning. You can t head out on Saturday night with your wife because you re off to the airport first thing on Sunday. There s no downtime. The kids are adaptable, though: they get used to seeing their dad for 24 hours a week.  George, in his late 50s, travels further still. He s on his way to Poland, via Stansted, where he works at a language school. He comes back every fortnight. Skype makes a big difference, he says. My wife is at home and I have teenage daughters. When you can see them, it helps. It s not ideal at all. It just makes me angry to think that it has come to this.  But it s not all downbeat. Karen Burke (25) is different from most. She s a newly-qualified speech and language therapist and is heading to London for good to take up her first job. Unemployed for the past year, she s delighted to be heading abroad.  I ve been out of work since last June, which has been rubbish, she says. But I m lucky I m one of a handful out of 35 graduates to get jobs, and we re all in England. I ve lots of friends over there. It s all very rushed I start tomorrow at 9am.  Three miles down the road is Charlestown, Co Mayo. Locals joke that the airport should be named after the town, given that it s far closer than Knock. It s a compact town with small retailers and wide, well-planned streets. As you pass the remains of a disused railway platform off the main street you suddenly, inexplicably, cross the border into Bellaghy, Co Sligo. Both towns lie side-by-side, the legacy of a historic grudge between two landowners. The story goes that during the 1840s, Lord Knox, who owned the land on the Sligo side of the border, insulted Charles Strickland, the agent of the landowner on the Mayo side. Strickland s revenge was to build a brand new town cheek-by-jowl with Bellaghy, complete with a rival market and more importantly dozens of pubs with liberal closing times. Bellaghy declined and Charlestown thrived. Today, Charlestown is a town of around 900 people. It s much quieter since the recent bypass diverted traffic from Dublin and Castlebar. But there s another reason the town is ghostly quiet, especially in the evenings. Unemployment and lack of job prospects means people are leaving. It s nothing new to these parts. The town s hinterland was ravaged by depopulation between the 1940s and 1960s and again in the 1980s. In his influential series for The Irish Times in 1967, No One Shouted Stop!, John Healy wrote of how the drip-feed of young people away from Charlestown was strangling it. Morning after morning in the 1940s they went in droves like cattle, he wrote. There were young boys and girls, young men and women and, too often, they had no education . . . no one got mad for them because they weren t going to make money and what was here for them but the bog?  When the boom arrived in the late 1990s, many felt the town had finally turned a corner. Many emigrants came home. Several new housing estates sprouted up around town. The government even pledged to relocate the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the area. Emigration, it seemed, was a thing of the past. Today, the word is back on everyone s lips. There are no official figures yet census data predates the downturn but if anecdotal evidence is anything to go by, the numbers heading abroad are growing by the day. HEALY S CAFE BAR on the main street, a popular haunts for young people in the area, has the hallmarks of a place furnished during the boom: dark timber floors, spot lights, tastefully decorated toilets. Barely a day goes by without someone announcing that they re leaving. Proprietor John Healy (no relation to the journalist John Healy) began to notice the phenomenon of emigration parties towards the end of 2009. They re still continuing.  I have one booked in for next week, he says. There was another where the lads sold a van, did an auction of the tools and had people over for the funeral . Then they were out the door. Gone.  Not so long ago, this place was buzzing. At 8pm on a Saturday evening, you might have 150 young people here and they d stay drinking till 2am. That s all changed.  Brian Colleran (33) is one of many young people from the town considering his future. He s reduced to doing a bit of part-time work on a farm, as well as working as a doorman on weekends. It can be lonely, he confides, seeing your circle of friends disappear.  I look at lots of friends who ve gone off. You see Facebook pictures of them at the beach and you think they re having a great time, and you must be missing out, he says. You see them here one week. And the next they re booking a flight to Australia. It s sad, because you see less and less of your own age group.  Over on the edge of town, the loss of young people is a growing concern at Charlestown Sarsfield GAA club. As a Monday night training session gets under way, trainer Steve Healy admits he is worried about the coming months.  As of now, we ve only lost a few players to places like England or Australia, so we re not that badly hit yet, he says. But lots of our players are in their final year in college and finishing construction-related courses. You wonder what kind of work will be around for them? How long will they stay here? We don t know. You have to say it doesn t look good.  Over at the grounds of the local soccer club, it s also a concern. About a third of the senior team is gone. Some of it is down to lads heading abroad, but more of it is down to players not being able to afford the day-to-day cost of training and playing.  It s very sad, says trainer Martin Hopkins. But we ve just got to keep going and try to find new players. Even with the numbers leaving, some are quick to point out that it s still no comparison to the black days of mass emigration. Fr Thomas Johnson, the town s parish priest, remembers the 1950s, when a GAA team would start off training in the summer with a full squad; by autumn they wouldn t have enough players to field a team.  It s an issue, yes, but I don t think it bears comparison to those days, he says. There is still work, there are lots of families. The number of children being baptised in recent years is holding steady, which is another plus.  Emigration is just one side of how the economic downturn is affecting the town. The collateral damage caused by unemployment and a slump in retail is potentially catastrophic for Charlestown and other towns in the region. HENRY S, WHICH SELLS men s clothes, is a simple shop. There are a few shelves with old-fashioned jumpers on one side; on the other side are jeans and shirts aimed at younger men. Trade isn t just slow it s almost non-existent. On some days there are no customers at all. On a good day, there are three or four purchases. Owner Jarlath Henry spends most of the day out back doing Sudoku puzzles or listening to the radio. Sales are diabolical, he says. How long can I keep going? To tell the truth, I m looking for a job. I d be gone in a flash. It s costing me to keep this place open. I ve maybe another month or two. As we speak, a stockist stops out front in a van, looking to sell clothes, but Henry waves him on. His shop is on Church Street, one of the three main roads into the town. He points out the closed pubs and grocery shops on the surrounding streets. Rates, he says, were simply too high for many of them to keep going. Over on the main street, Joe Mahon is feeling the pinch. His Spar is the largest shop in town and is coping with both the recession and competition from large out-of-town supermarkets. Most of his ire is directed at planning authorities. Tesco, which opened in neighbouring Swinford, had a dramatic impact in drawing trade away from Charlestown since it opened last year, he says.  It just sucks trade away from the surrounding towns. It might employ 100 people, but it takes them away from other areas. What does that achieve? Nothing. And most of the profits go back to Britain, he says. Not everyone is gloomy about the town s prospects. In sharp contrast, George Cregg, a salesman and chair of the town s chamber of commerce, is a voice of relentless optimism. A returned emigrant from the US, he retains that country s can-do approach to business. His wife runs the Market Cafe.  Since the bypass we ve doubled in trade, he says. Now, people who pass through are more likely to stop off. Before, they were always on the go and they wouldn t stop.  His own business he delivers office supplies to companies across the region is also thriving. I m positive. If we re negative with customers, it just adds to the negativity. We have to be more positive. There is a great quality of life. We have a new Government now, we should have an amnesty on negativity. It s time to get rid of the baggage we had and get on with things. We shouldn t be stuck in a rut.  SO WHAT DOES the future hold for a place like Charlestown? Most agree the town is in a far better position than it was in the late 1960s, with better standards of education, a bigger population and better infrastructure. If the economy does rebound, then places like Charlestown should be in a good position to benefit. But there are other, more immediate concerns. The town s only secondary school faces an uncertain future. The Marist Sisters announced recently that they plan to withdraw their patronage of the school within three years. If no alternative patron is found, more than 200 students will need to find alternative schools. Town leaders, though, are hopeful it won t come to that. John Healy s brother Gerry feels prospects for Charlestown are as bad as they were in the 1950s or the 1980s. I lived through those recessions but they were nothing like this, he says. Then, people were more self-sufficient and had their own food. They didn t have the personal debt people have today. These young fellas, who had their vans with their names on the side of them, are gone. I don t see them coming back.  Most aren t quite as negative. Over the longer term, local leaders say fostering and supporting small businesses will be vital to creating sustainable communities.  We seem to be making it as hard as possible for businesses in small-town Ireland that are struggling to survive, says local Sinn Féin councillor Gerry Murray. We have high rates, high energy costs. We need to tackle that. I don t think the Government realises the scale of the problem at local level.  There is no shortage of bright ideas to breathe new life into this part of rural Ireland. Just down the road at Ireland West airport, the chairman, Liam Scollan, has ambitious plans to develop an industrial park in the area. It has the potential, he says, to create 300 jobs over a five-year period in tourism, renewable energy and IT.  We ve been very disappointed at the response of the Government, he says. For two years, we ve had definitive proposals to create these jobs. But it s as if we ve been telling them about paint drying.  Foreign direct investment in the region has been a positive, he says, but it s hardly sustainable and few have a genuine commitment to the country.  If you look back, we were bailed out by Europe in the 1980s. We were bailed out by American multinational investment in the 1990s, and now we ve been bailed out by the EU and IMF, Scollan says. We need to create wealth of our own, rather than become fodder for overseas investors.  Optimists such as George Cregg acknowledge the scale of the problem his son will likely emigrate after college but he feels the future will be bright if the right decisions are made and entrepreneurs are encouraged.  I think back in the 1960s, there was a black cloud over this area. People were emigrating straight out of school. Now it s different. We re better educated. We re a different breed of people. I think we re a population which will take a chance and give it the best shot.  Those people leaving now? We desperately need them to come back. I ve no doubt that, in time, they will.  Building a future for Charlestown To see what hard work and vision can achieve in a town like Charlestown, you head out of the town until a sprawling manufacturing plant appears on the town s outskirts. Thirty years ago, this was a glorified shed. Tom Grady mortgaged his small farm and set up a joinery workshop. Today, Grady Joinery is a large business which produces A-rated windows and doors which up to recently could only be imported. At its height it employed 300 people, though numbers reduced to around half that since the downturn. But things are beginning to look up once again. Just last week, the company advertised to fill some vacancies in quality assurance and sales. In the town things are difficult, says Tom s son, Arthur Grady. ""But unlike the last recession, there are good prospects. There s a vibrant airport within miles of here, much improved road network and broadband which makes its possible for small businesses to offer their services to a wider customer base thus grow and create employment. It s a long way from the scenes in Charlestown depicted by journalist John Healy who was horrified at the complacency and apathy of the political establishment as thousands of his contemporaries emigrated in the late 1960s. There is in Charlestown of 1967, wrote Healy, a savage echo of Synge s world, for you can stand above the town on the straggling plantation and echo the words of Maura in Riders to the Sea: They re all gone now and there isn t anything more the sea can do to me. The series - and the resulting book, published as Death of an Irish Town- didn t go down well with locals who objected to the notion that their town was dying. Healy s brother brother Gerry, who still lives in the town, joked that he couldn t get a drink in Charlestown for six months. Retired history professor and Mayo man, Prof Seamus Ó Catháin, is an admirer of Healy s work, but feels the extent of emigration was exaggerated. The area did suffer. But remember, the GAA team of ghosts he wrote about went onto win the county championship in 1972. And it was trained by his nephew! he says. The late 1960s were perhaps the nadir, but it grew during the 1970s. Between the 1980s and 2000, the town grew by 20 per cent. In that sense, the story of Charlestown is a positive one. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-04,2014,"April 4, 2014",Fine Gael pays the price,"Fianna F^oil candidates for the local and European elections will be heartened by the findings of the latest Irish Times /IpsosMRBI opinion poll that show the party to be level with Fine Gael in terms of popular support and four points clear of Sinn F^8in. With seven weeks to go until the elections, the party is well placed to recover some of the seats it lost in 2009, but it continues to face serious problems in Dublin.  A succession of controversies involving the Garda S^Koch^ona and the manner in which Minister for Justice Alan Shatter dealt with them has had a significant effect on approval ratings for both Fine Gael and the Government. Satisfaction with the Government has fallen by four points to 26 per cent since December, wiping out the gains it made on exiting the EU-IMF bailout. Support for Fine Gael dropped by five points to 25 per cent. Labour Party support dropped by just one point to 9 per cent but, at that level, many of its candidates face an uncertain future.  There will be some concern within Sinn F^8in over the party's failure to make ground on this occasion. But the security issues at the heart of recent controversies and its own historical baggage may account for the drift of dissatisfied voters towards Fianna F^oil and Independent candidates. Paradoxically, approval for Gerry Adams jumped by six points to 33 per cent, making him the most popular party leader.  The strong showing of Independent candidates is likely to have a profound effect on the election results. Public support for this disparate group equals that for Sinn F^8in and lags behind Fine Gael and Fianna F^oil by only four points. Traditional voting patterns have been crushed with four, almost equivalent, political blocs emerging. If discipline is shown, in terms of voting transfers, Independents could do very well. The Labour Party has become detached from the front-runners, with a support level of only 8 per cent nationally. The Government parties may look to Dublin for some relief. Unlike the situation in other parts of the country, Fine Gael support increased by a single point while that of the Labour Party remained steady. The gains that were made here flowed towards Independents, while support levels for both Sinn F^8in and Fianna F^oil actually declined. On those figures, Fianna F^oil will find it extremely difficult to regain a European Parliament seat in the capital. With almost one-third of the electorate unwilling to vote or undecided about their intentions, all parties have an opportunity to improve their situations during the coming weeks. Fine Gael and the Labour Party will be anxious to draw attention to the jobs created and the economic progress made, while Opposition politicians can be expected to concentrate on the Government's inept handling of security matters.

The Irish Times,Apr-04,2020,"April 4, 2020",Pension pot raid fraught with difficulties,"When Mercer, one of the blue-bloods of the Irish financial sector, starts advising people to take money out of pensions, it's clear we are living in extraordinary times.  Suggesting that people should get access to pension funds that, in general, are already far from healthy enough to provide the retirement income people expect is anathema to advisers like Mercer. So the Government will not easily dismiss the notion - despite the technical, tax and legislative difficulties.  It will also weigh carefully the prospect of separately securing pension fund investment in the State's eventual need to drive economic recovery after the worst of the coronavirus pandemic passes - through something like an inflation- linked emergency bond. But for people plunged suddenly into an uncertain financial future, it is the possibility of accessing their pension that will grab the attention. However, the question is whether now is the correct time to raid pension funds.  Irish-managed pension funds have suffered their worst three-month performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with Rubicon Investment Consulting data showing that most of the pension fund growth of the past five years has been wiped out in a matter of weeks. A poor February, when Covid-19 jitters unsettled markets, was followed by a equity bloodbath in March with funds shedding more than 11 per cent of their value. That means the average Irish managed fund is almost 16 per cent poorer since the start of the year. Cashing out now - even by taking some money from pension funds - will lock in those losses and make saving adequately for retirement even more difficult. Most market analysts say the time for liquidating shares is long past: for now the best move is to sit tight. It's sound advice but little comfort to hundreds of thousands of people struggling to figure out how they will pay bills that are looming.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-05,2005,"April 5, 2005",Exchequer returns,"The Exchequer figures point to a better-than-expected outturn in the Government's finances for the first three months of the year. A surplus of EUR 880 million is recorded, more than three times the surplus recorded in the first quarter of last year. However, the figures are not indicative of the likely outcome for the full year and they suggest that consumer spending, despite Central Bank warnings, continues to grow strongly. 20050404224353 The Exchequer returns reveal that tax revenue, at EUR 9.2 billion, was EUR 221 million ahead of the forecast figure. The largest component of this overshoot occurred in VAT receipts which were some EUR 139 million higher. This indicates that spending on consumer goods and on cars continues to power ahead. The fact that stamp duty brought in EUR 38 million more than anticipated also indicates that the same applies to property sales. The level of Government spending in the first quarter was EUR 438 million less than expected. Department of Finance officials were quick to point out, however, that the underspend can be attributed to timing factors in the financial year. Perhaps of more consequence is the level of income-tax receipts, which are EUR 12 million less than expected. This shortfall must be seen in context: it amounts to just 0.5 per cent of total income-tax receipts. But it occurs at a time of rapidly-growing employment. The latest Fas study shows that the number of jobs in the economy rose by 65,200 last year to just under 1.9 million, the largest year-on-year increase in four years. Obviously many of the jobs must fall into the low-paid category. And the outlook for income tax receipts is also uncertain because the economy is now close to full employment so job growth can be expected to cool down. The European Commission's Spring Economic Forecasts, also issued yesterday, predict that our GDP will grow by 4.9 per cent this year and 5.1 per cent next year. This compares very favourably with a growth forecast for the 12-member euro zone as a whole of just 1.6 per cent; only the Baltic countries will outperform us. But the rosy economic outlook can only last for as long as the economic fundamentals remain favourable. Irish exporters are already suffering from the rise in the value of the euro and consumers are feeling the pain of higher oil prices. Consumer spending is indeed strong but that is mostly because interest rates are so low. If interest rates rise, borrowers may find their debt servicing costs climbing faster than their incomes. The Central Bank would do well to remind the heavier borrowers of the risks involved.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-06,2019,"April 6, 2019",All eyes on sterling next week,"Sterling's trajectory in recent months has closely matched the ebbs and flows of the Brexit talks. This has been an uncertain environment for Irish exporters, but not one causing significant difficulties, with the euro moving generally between 85p and 88p sterling. In the immediate wake of the Brexit vote a lot worse had been feared. But we are not out of the woods yet - not by a long way. This week the Central Bank estimated that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, where the UK simply crashes out of the EU, the euro would rise to around 97p sterling. Previous studies of Irish exporters - one involving the food sector and one more general exporters - suggested that once the rate rises above 90p serious competitiveness issues start to emerge.  Add this to the threat of tariffs on some exports in the event of a no-deal exit and you have a potentially big hit on exports from the indigenous sector - and on jobs. Sterling lost some ground yesterday, trading at around 86.2p in late dealing against the euro. Investors still feel on balance that a no-deal exit will be avoided, but that the risk is not off the table yet.  The outlook for next week will be determined by the Brexit talks and the ECB council meeting on Thursday. ECB president Mario Draghi is expected to maintain his cautious tone on interest rates and the economic outlook, and this is a factor limiting support for the single currency.  For sterling, the current price assumes a further extension next week, but probably not a lot more. A conclusive move towards a softer Brexit or a long delay would thus be likely to send sterling higher. However, as the Central Bank warned, a lurch to an unexpected no-deal at the end of next week - or at some later date - could lead to an even sharper sell-off.  Traders will be conscious of the old business saying that ""time is the enemy of a deal"". And time is now desperately short.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-06,2019,"April 6, 2019",The changing face of Irish home ownership: who wins and who loses?; Ireland is undergoing a huge shift in its pattern of home ownership. But what does this mean for people here?,"Like a lot of Irish people her age, Elizabeth feels trapped. ""The help-to-buy scheme is no good to me because the cost of new builds is so astronomical as to make it pointless to even try. I'm also not eligible for the lower-income mortgages provided by the local authorities as I earn too much, but not really enough to do it on my own."" In her early 30s and living in Dublin, she spends thousands a year on rent while trying to save for a deposit.  As a single person, she feels even more constrained by the Central Bank's rules which limit lending to 3½ times household income. Even if a deposit could be saved, the price tag for homes in areas where she wants to live leaves them out of her reach.  The future for people like Elizabeth is uncertain; hemmed in by record rents, restrictive rules on mortgage borrowing and ever-climbing house prices, they are stuck in a rental sector that offers few protections and little certainty.  Statistics show that Ireland is undergoing a historic shift in its traditional pattern of home ownership. But what does this mean for Irish people, and who are the winners and losers from this process? A nation of homeowners In many ways  the Irish experience of independence has been one of gradual but significant improvements in living standards. Much of this has been driven by the accumulation of property, primarily owning one's own home. This peaked in 1991, when 79.3 per cent of Irish people were homeowners. There is plenty of folk wisdom about what drove this; an innate yearning among a historically dispossessed people for the security of ownership; an obsession with land stemming back to the Famine years and beyond. The reality, however, is that this was done by design, not by accident. UCD professor of social policy Michelle Norris, who is on the board of the State's new Land Development Agency, says home ownership was the defining social policy goal of successive Irish governments. ""There's no doubt that the expansion of home ownership was built on enormous levels of State spending,"" she says. It was, she argues, so massive that it is impossible to calculate a precise figure. Grants, rates remissions, tax reliefs, interest reliefs and more interventions were prominent, while the State's appetite for the provision of healthcare, education and social welfare was subdued. ""It was really giving people property as a form of welfare, rather than redistributing income as they did in other countries,"" she says. Periods of high inflation, such as in the 1970s, made the burden of mortgage repayments significantly easier to tolerate, while renters were generally composed of the very young or the very poor.  According to a recent research paper from the Department of Finance, ""by the 1980s Irish private rental accommodation was a 'forgotten tenure', with the majority of privately rented homes being of poor quality and intended for temporary accommodation"". Large-scale social housing programmes also delivered local authority homes to low earners, who were encouraged to buy long before the idea caught on in other countries. ""Thatcher thought this was a great idea in 1981, but we introduced it in 1936,"" says Norris.  A changing picture Starting in the 1980s, the once-common bonuses for home buyers on offer from the State gradually fell away. Councils trimmed their role offering mortgages, and banks emerged as major lenders in place of building societies. Even during the boom, the level of home ownership was declining  and it continued to do so during the recession. Between 2011 and 2016, home ownership fell 2.1 per cent. At the last census the home ownership rate was 67.6 per cent, lower than the EU average of 69.2 per cent.  ""We've moved far faster than people think,"" says John Moran, chairman of the Land Development Agency.  ""The evidence is very strong that there's a real shift,"" says Dr Rory O'Donnell, director of the National Economic and Social Council. ""There's every reason to believe it's fairly permanent because the conditions which underpinned high levels of home ownership at early stages of the life cycle, those conditions have gone.""  The traditional image of the Irish homestead, bursting at the seams with children, perhaps with a grandparent or two thrown in for good measure, has also never been less accurate. Of 600,000 households formed since 1996, some 400,000 are estimated to comprise either one or two people. Average household sizes are now 2.75, ahead of European averages, but the Department of Finance believes ""there is no obvious reason why Irish rates will not continue to converge with the European norm"". Rent seeking Renting is a reality for more people living in Ireland than ever before. However, the structure of that sector is still shaped by the fact  it was for so long a forgotten child.  Compared with other markets, Irish renters face uncertainty on rent costs, how long their leases are and what the future holds for them.  ""When you look at more developed markets, they have spent more time thinking about these issues than we have,"" says John Moran. There have been reforms in recent years - most notably rent pressure zones, and just this week, extensions to notice-to-quit periods and penalties for landlords who break the rules on termination provisions.  The surge in renters - and rents - has made for good business for a lot of overseas investors. Profits at Ires Reit, the State's largest private landlord, climbed from EUR 65.1 million to EUR 119.8 million last year, earning its chief executive, Margaret Sweeney, a EUR 330,000 bonus, on top of the same sum in salary. There is what property insiders describe as a ""wall of cash"" trying to get into the Irish rental sector. Estate agent CBRE has estimated that there is EUR 7 billion of so-called institutional capital - large swathes of cash, controlled by professional money managers - chasing apartment stock in Ireland.  These investors can afford to outbid individual buyers as well. One industry analysis shows that for a notional development of 50 apartments in Dublin, a builder could expect to make just short of EUR 17 million in sales. However, if an investor could extract an average rent from each apartment of EUR 2,000 a month, it could afford to pay a builder EUR 24 million. It is no contest, and recent sales have seen large homebuilders such as Cairn Homes and Glenveagh sell entire apartment developments in one fell swoop. Overall, large institutional landlords such as Ires Reit or American investment fund Kennedy Wilson make up a tiny percentage of the national rental market. According to the residential tenancies board, less than 5 per cent of tenancies are controlled by landlords with more than 100 tenancies in total. There are only 19 landlords in the State with more than 200 tenancies each. But they are growing, and in certain segments the growth is more pronounced.  Although it is still low, the Department of Finance estimates that the number of landlords with more than 200 properties more than doubled between April 2014 and December 2016. The same research suggests that corporate landlords are being concentrated geographically.  In 20 areas in Dublin city, more than 20 per cent of apartments were rented out by companies. In 2017 more than 40 per cent of all new apartments in the State were bought by firms categorised as being in the financial and insurance or real estate sectors. Meanwhile, investors benefit from specially designed tax structures such as the Reit (Real Estate Investment Trust) regime. John Moran, who helped design the scheme, says criticisms of it are poorly founded, but nonetheless it is expected that the Department of Finance will review the scheme in advance of the budget this year, benchmarking its generosity against other jurisdictions. There are concerns that an overconcentration of ownership of the rental stock could lead to ""monopolistic or oligopolistic"" pricing power, the crowding out of first-time buyers, or a sort of inverse ghettoisation, where rich people are concentrated in enclaves of luxury apartments owned by international investors. Although it is early days, and the impact can easily be overstated by eye-catching examples, it is clear that Ireland's shift towards rental is extremely lucrative for some. A time bomb For a society like Ireland, perhaps it is unsurprising that trends  such as those described above can rankle. However, there is a persuasive case to be made for institutional investment and moving away from property ownership. ""The advantages of institutional investment are manifold, broad-based and beginning to yield positive outcomes for the Irish housing system,"" the Department of Finance has argued.  The construction and purchase of homes by these players supports a host of goals the Government has, from increasing density to switching the source of funds for Irish property development away from banks and towards international money markets. Ireland, it is suggested, may end up being more like Germany, with long-term leases at affordable rents offered by large-scale professional landlords. The problem, critics say, is not necessarily with the shift towards rental, or who you might be renting from, but with the structure of Irish wealth itself. And the fear is that we may be storing up serious problems for the future. ""We've seen a revolution in the housing sector of renting long term, if not for ever, without addressing the socioeconomic context to see whether that is feasible or not,"" according to Lorcan Sirr, a lecturer in housing studies and urban economics at the Technological University in Dublin. ""And right now, it's simply not."" ""About half of Ireland's wealth per capita is tied up in housing. Each of us is worth about EUR 140,000, and EUR 70,000 is in housing. We have to rely on the value of those assets to see us through the ups and downs of life."" The Irish experience of a house standing in for the welfare state counts for pensions, too, according to Moran. In other jurisdictions people can often expect a high percentage of their salary in pension, enabling them to keep paying some form of rent until they die. ""The way Irish people tended to deal with that is through high home ownership,"" he says. Basically, housing in retirement was free once a mortgage was paid off, allowing for a massive drop in income. The problem is that with an underfunded pension scheme, and dwindling levels of home ownership, a whole generation of Irish people face the possibility of spending their working life paying high rents with nothing to show for it when they retire - and no income to fund the roof over their heads. In the interim, many of the benefits of home ownership - such as releasing equity to fund a child's education - will remain out of the reach of renters, who will also see other parts of their lives curtailed as large chunks of their income is handed over to a landlord each month. ""It's very hard to see anything emerging apart from higher levels of renting. It's problematic socially and it's problematic economically,"" says Michelle Norris. One possible solution is to engage in large-scale development of so-called ""cost rental"", where rents are determined by the cost of providing the home, rather than what the market will command. Such developments have been successful around Europe, most notably in Vienna. Earlier this week a week-long exhibition was launched by Dublin City Council and the Housing Agency on this very model. However, these models have been common in cities like Vienna for generations. There is no guarantee that Ireland can deftly, and rapidly, make the switch. What is clear is that the dramatic shift away from property ownership will need equally dramatic policy solutions.  ""We've gone down a route that is promoting renting without fully analysing the potential impact of having fewer people owning their own properties,"" says Lorcan Sirr. ""If we don't start housing people affordably, we are going to have a ticking time bomb when the current generation of 25-to 40-year-olds hit retirement.""",1
The Irish Times,Apr-08,2005,"April 8, 2005",UK rates stay at 4.75% until election at least,"The Bank of England kept interest rates at 4.75 per cent for the eighth month running, but many economists expect another rise once the May 5th general election is out of the way. The decision follows recent reports suggesting that typically free-spending British consumers are feeling the pinch from five rate hikes in one and a half years and a slowing housing market. 20050407232625 Data out shortly before the Monetary Policy Committee's decision also underlined the fragility of the British manufacturing recovery. Output fell for the first time in six months in February. But economists said the bank might still raise borrowing costs at either its May or June meetings to ensure that inflation does not rise above its 2.0 per cent target as the overall economy keeps growing strongly. Two MPC members had already voted for a hike in February. ""We still think a quarter point rise will come by June,"" said Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. ""But the situation is uncertain and when taken together with the general election campaign, (it) probably nudged the MPC towards leaving interest rates on hold. The MPC decides rates free from government influence but is keen to avoid any accusation of political bias. It has rescheduled next month's rate announcement from election day to May 9th.",1
The Irish Times,Apr-08,2015,"April 8, 2015",Twinkles in a ministerial eye; Childcare,"Few would deny that money devoted to early childcare and parental support is well spent. Studies by the OECD have found that Irish child-minding costs inhibit participation by mothers in the workforce and contribute to relative child poverty and disadvantage. But successive governments have been reluctant to provide the necessary financial resources to tackle that situation or disturb the view that a mother's primary place is in the home. Now, as an election approaches, long and short-term political aspirations are being unveiled.  TÃ¡naiste and Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton got in first by promising two weeks of paid paternity leave for fathers in the coming Budget. That has been trumped by the recommendations of an expert group established by Minister for Children James Reilly. It has proposed the introduction of a full year's paid leave, shared between both parents. Not only that, an additional free, preschool year is also under consideration, along with improvement of after-school care services.  This year-long parental leave scheme and an additional preschool year are just twinkles in the Minister's eye. They stand no chance of being funded this year. Instead, they are likely to appear in a general election manifesto. Two years ago, the Government decided in principle to fund an additional preschool year but baulked over its cost and the uncertain quality of the care being provided. The notion of couples sharing 12 months of social welfare-funded parental leave has not been discussed by Cabinet and could take at least five years to implement. A doubling of existing costs was mentioned. But what the hell, the changes would appeal to some young families. After years of complaint, the cost of childcare in Ireland remains the highest in the EU. In terms of family disposable income, it is double that of the UK and three times that of France. The Government actually reduced funding for this sector four years ago. Unemployment has since fallen from 15 to 10 per cent and jobs are being created at an impressive rate.  If women are to share fully in the economic recovery, long-term unemployment is tackled, and children given a good start in life, the Government will have to shift its focus from short-term tax cuts and public pay restoration to long-term social planning.  Now is the time to provide adequate funding for after-school care services and for a second, free preschool year. The cost of providing childcare and the need for rigorous oversight is so great that progress is likely to be slow. That should not inhibit the Government from taking action. As for parents caring equally for children in the home: it is a positive, forward-looking idea. But it fails to recognise the tyranny of day-to-day financial demands. Pie in the sky should remain there. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-09,2010,"April 9, 2010",Publishers must keep a grip on economics when eyeing up iPad,"WIRED:Caution should be the watchword when trying to create profitable content for a new device LIKE ANY other geek with a pulse, I was glued last week to watching the first, excited demonstrations of software available for the Apple iPad. Drooling at the rather beautiful animated and interactive iPad adaptation of Theodore Gray s Elementscoffee-table book, however, I suddenly flashed back to a previous age of exciting new computing media. I thought of the CD-rom age of the 1990s, of the money thrown into interactive media sinkholes by publishers and the market carnage that followed, and wondered if it was all about to begin again. I fear the iPad will lure traditional publishing houses, just as the CD-rom did 20 years ago, and they will make the same mistakes: mistakes they can now ill-afford. CD-roms were the last-but-one great hope for publishing houses at the tail-end of the 20th century struggling to understand what they might be doing in the 21st. Companies from Dorling-Kindersley to News Corp threw millions into developing electronic books : software burned onto the first CD discs and designed to run on Apple or PC hardware. These companies got back very little return on their investment. Their early projects boiled down to fancy-schmancy but clunky David Bowie vanity projects, incredibly complex and labour-intensive animated reworkings of their existing bestsellers. Each one won more awards than it sold copies, and eventually those interactive divisions were rolled into the online media departments, where their designers would struggle to take their 700MB visions and use them within the drastic limits of the first web pages. In the inevitable postmortem, people muttered about how it was the internet that killed the CD-rom but I think that, as ever, the real murderer was economics. A professional CD-rom was just too expensive to produce, relative to the format it was generally parasitical upon. I would marvel at the incredible lopsided nature of CD-roms given free in magazines. The CD-rom could hold close to a gigabyte of data, including programs, movies and graphics all of which had to be commissioned, collated, edited, checked for viruses, cleared for copyright, mastered and burned. If done well, a front-mounted CD-rom was a far more expensive venture than actually putting out a magazine and yet they usually paid a single person to do it all, didn t charge for the CD, and probably got little advertising revenue from it. Most started attempting to flash up their CD products with incredibly fancy interactive environments that would quickly consume their annual budget. The ones that survived would ultimately collapse into padding the CD-rom out with cheap, throwaway software. Professional product got thrown out of the window in an attempt to feed the ever-hungry maw of interactive content. This, to me, is the flipside of the digital technology makes everything cheaper argument. It makes a lot of work cheaper, but it can also make professional-quality media fantastically more expensive than its analogue equivalents. Elementswill do very well, because it benefits from that fresh platform smell the iPad exudes. But can you re-gear a newspaper or a publishing house to produce the level of interactive complexity that even the simplest app is going to demand, when it is competing with games and films? Of course, this time around, it may be very different. The audience is far, far bigger. Our price-points for digital media are all over the shop. We ll pay more for a ringtone than a full MP3. We pay $10 for a stream of alphanumeric characters on our Amazon Kindle if it s written by Stephen King, and a dollar for a pocket application that plays farts. Who knows what we might pay for an iPad version of Timemagazine? But if you believe, as Timedoes, that iPad owners are going to pay $5 every week for an exciting new interactive Timeapplication, I think you re running against the clock. No matter how you innovate, other applications are going to make yours look ridiculously clumsy in a matter of months. In a year people will be amazed anyone paid $14 for something as old-fashioned as Elements. I know old media companies will seize on the iPad, with its payment system and closed environment, as a life raft in this uncertain age. And publishing companies will be tempted to go for the all-singing, all-dancing iPad application. But they risk doing what many companies did in the CD-rom era: spending money on a prestige project, when what they need is an incoming revenue stream. The goldrush economics of the iPad will hide this for a little while, because everything will be briefly profitable. But to be sustainable in the digital world, you need the same conditions as the real world. You can t just make some single wonderful shiny demo product. You need to keep producing them: you need some way of economising that process. And you need to stop others from making their shiny thing cheaper than, yet interchangeable with, yours. Despite what Steve Jobs says, sometimes everything isn t magically, revolutionarily, different, no matter how shiny the product.",0
The Irish Times,Apr-09,2011,"April 9, 2011",A plan to save Smithfield square,"It was supposed to be a bustling cultural quarter but instead it s seen as a barren, intimidating space. Plans are now afoot to reinvigorate the district, writes CARL O'BRIEN, Chief Reporter WHATEVER ABOUT the plan s shortcomings, they didn t lack ambition. The 12 giant gas braziers would light up the night sky, acting as beacons to attract people to Smithfield. The large square would host all of Dublin s major civic events, from rock concerts and the St Patrick s Day parade to the marathon. The horse fair would be moved elsewhere, while the arrival of the Luas and high-end apartments would transform one of the city s most neglected areas into a bustling, dynamic urban quarter. Today, just over a decade after the regeneration of Smithfield began, many of these aims either have been derailed or are still waiting to be realised. The gas braziers aren t lit any more (the official reason is they re not considered eco-friendy; it also happens to cost upwards of EUR 500 an hour to run them). Dozens of shops are lying empty and the square is seldom used as a civic amenity. Key pieces of the regeneration jigsaw, such as the relocation of Dublin Institute of Technology to Grangegorman and the renovation of the city markets, have stalled. At a time when the area needed a lift, a shooting at last month s horse fair was yet another blow to its faltering reputation. But disappointing as the the pace of development at the square has been, there is another layer to the story of Smithfield s regeneration that is less evident. Some traders are quietly growing, while cultural and theatre groups are taking over empty commercial premises and beginning to transform parts of the area into an alternative, artistic community reminiscent of Temple Bar in the 1980s. Slowly, the vision of Smithfield as a cultural quarter is becoming a reality, though in a way that few envisaged. Overall, planners insist it is far too early to say the regeneration plans have failed. They acknowledge that the pace of growth has been much slower than expected, and that mistakes were made in the design of the area, but fresh plans are afoot to try to tap into the full potential of the area in dramatically changed economic circumstances. IN A DARK, cavernous, empty retail space fronting on to Smithfield square is the Complex, a venue that s quickly developing a reputation for live performances and festivals. Despite the industrial appearance, it feels oddly appropriate for a theatre. The building was recently transferred to Nama, so it s fitting that yesterday it began hosting performances of The Merchant of Venice. A classic Shakespearean tale of love and hate with a moral all too familiar in the current clime all that glisters is not gold , say the promotional posters. Down the street, Block T is based in what was an old, dingy Chinese market. It hosts art exhibitions, Berlin-style underground gigs and poetry readings.  We ve 17 resident artists, studios where they work, and we re hosting performances and workshops and exhibitions, says Laura Downs, who helped establish the venue and who also runs a creative agency, Talented Minds.  Just this weekend we re launching a gallery, and the response has been brilliant. We re beginning to get a lot of attention from the press, who are beginning to realise what s happening here.  We re tapping into a strong creative ethos here in Smithfield and beyond, in places like Stoneybatter, Ormond Quay, the Liberties. There are so many talented people living here: photographers, actors, designers. Remember, the vision for Smithfield was for it to become a cultural quarter.  Another of Smithfield s key tenants is the Light House Cinema. Maretta Dillon and Neil Connolly operated the original two-screen Light House on Abbey Street from 1988 to 1996. The new cinema at Smithfield, with its plush, multicoloured seats, caters mainly for an art-house audience. Business has not been easy, although the owners say box-office receipts have improved since the start of 2011. January and February of this year were its busiest two months to date, with successful screenings of the French film Of Gods and Men and the Oscar-winning The King s Speech. Depsite this, the Light House faces an uncertain future. The owners are in dispute with their landlord, who has brought a winding-up petition against the cinema, over the doubling of their rent. The petition has been adjourned until Friday.  We remain hopeful that common sense will prevail and that we ll manage to reach a resolution with the landlord in advance of the hearing, says Connolly.  It s been a very challenging environment for us to attempt to survive in. The vision for Smithfield that everyone imagined back in 2007 when we signed the lease has been gravely disappointing. This was supposed to be a bustling, vibrant area with a lot going on, but that hasn t been realised. The public perception is that it s an intimidating, dark space that s far away from the city centre with not enough people. The only reason we re succeeding is that we re a destination venue.  What people don t always realise, he says, is that there is ample parking in the area (there s a multistorey close by) and that the venue is a short walk from the Luas stop.  We re confident there is still huge potential. If we can resolve the rent issue, we still have big ambitions for the place, and there is a huge amount of goodwill towards us.  THE AREA STILL has its problems. These days Smithfield s centrepiece, the cobbled and granite-paved square, which is the size of two GAA pitches, feels empty and forbidding. Local gardaí say petty theft and car robberies are a major problem. New CCTV cameras were installed on the square following a mini-riot outside the Children s Court last year. Ramanathan Murugesu, who is his 30s and has been running the kiosk at the Smithfield Luas stop for two years, was beset with vandalism and theft in the early days.  People were afraid to come and run the kiosk because of the reputation for robberies, break-ins, vandalism. he says. Yes, I have had my trouble here, but it s fading away a bit now. You begin to know trouble makers. Mostly, it s just kids trying to impress their friends.  Some locals say the lack of commerce and people around at night can make it feel intimidating. In addition, people still regard the monthly horse fair as a problem, although there are significant numbers who say it should be retained and better managed.  It s a Dublin fair. It s our tradition, and it should stay, says Dessie Hughes from Co Meath, who was selling horses with his two sons last Sunday. If there was more support for it, this would be a big success. And look at all the tourists around here.  Gus Smyth, another horse trader from Meath, says the reputation for the mistreatment of horses is unfair on the majority of responsible traders. I ve sold well and bought well here, says Smyth, holding a traditional Irish cob by a piece of rope. Most horses are in very good condition, but a small number aren t. They are the exception. The same thing is true of any farm around the country.  Dublin City Council has long sought the removal of the fair but has been blocked by an ancient market right of horse traders to hold their sales on the land. In the meantime planners say they are working to kick-start the regeneration plans with a series of enhancement works to the area. These include providing access to the square for tour buses, redeveloping the southern end of the square close to the quays, which was never completed, as a children s play area and softening the open square with grass and planters.  We don t see the present works as re-envisaging Smithfield. It still has the grandiose vision to it; this is more to do with supporting the elements that haven t been working, says Brian Swan, Dublin City Council s deputy city architect.  This reworked Smithfield will have a more constant level of activity. There ll be greater scope to have smaller-scale events on a regular basis, like food markets, book markets, clothes markets. The square needs a life 365 days a year instead of it being used just once in a blue moon.  Already there are encouraging signs. The old Chief O Neill s hotel is to be taken over by Generator Hostels, which is fitting out a 500-bed budget hotel. Some empty shops are expected to be occupied again in the summer. The tour buses that ferry 750,000 tourists around the city will begin to arrive soon. Perhaps the most optimistic of all for Smithfield s future is Paddy Kelly, the developer whose consortium was involved in building much of the west side of the square and some of whose retail properties were recently transferred to Nama. He says the scheme shows that apartment living can work and that families in Ireland, as on the Continent, are happy to live in high-quality schemes.  Overall, I think it s been 95 per cent positive, he says. The apartments are fully occupied, you have a hotel, a supermarket, a medical clinic. There s a lot in the area that s right. All we re missing is retail on the ground. When rents comes down, and we get rid of upward-only rent reviews, we ll begin to see a lot of progress. I m sure of that. ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-09,2014,"April 9, 2014",State visit puts seal on the end of an era for Ireland; Reciprocal state visits suggest Britain and the Republic finally see each other as separate but equal,"After the Treaty of 1921 the Irish poet and mystic George Russell (""AE"") pointed out, with his habitual shrewdness, that the reasons why Ireland had to separate from Britain lay in ""the psychological factor"" rather than oppressive government - which was, by the time of the revolution, no longer an issue. But history and psychology made the Irish regard any kind of government by the British as ""a tyranny inflicted on them by aliens"" who were incapable of understanding their aspirations to a less material, complacent world than the model of Anglicisation on offer.  The same message can be read through the Anglophobic reactions of many of the revolutionary generation; independence was necessary, one of them remarked, so the English would have to stop talking down to the Irish with their ""damned superior smiles"". The subject of England's condescension to its Celtic neighbours, currently back in focus as the Scottish referendum approaches, is a rich one. But as regards Ireland, the current state visit by President Michael D Higgins puts the seal on the end of an era.  The incomplete and uncertain way that Ireland left the union may have contributed to the continuance of ancien regime attitudes. After a civil war fought over the question of allegiance to the crown, the country remained from 1922 to 1948 a restive member of the commonwealth, while establishing many of the institutions and appurtenances of an independent state. The surprise declaration of a 26-county republic in 1948 clarified some things about the relationship, but not all: certain reciprocal and non-reciprocal rights remained (the Irish in Britain retaining voting rights not awarded to the British in Ireland for many years). The continuing flow of emigration from Ireland to its larger neighbour was a constant. And official attitudes tended, in some ways, to view Ireland as not quite separate and certainly not equal. In the mid-20th century the Anglo-Irish novelist Elizabeth Bowen remarked that the two countries regarded each other with ""a mixture of showing off and suspicion, nearly as bad as sex"".  The status of Northern IrelandThe change in approach signified by the first official Irish state visit comes in the wake not only of Queen Elizabeth's extraordinary state visit nearly three years ago but of decades when British- Irish relations have become closer and closer. Paradoxical as it may seem, part of the reason lies in the very issue that bedevilled British-Irish relations through the decades since independence: the status of Northern Ireland. So long as the official view on each side of the Irish Sea adhered to the mutually exclusive fantasies that Northern Ireland was either as British as Yorkshire or platonically part of a visionary 32-county Republic there was little hope of advance.  The process of recognising where the problems of identity and allegiance really lay was recognised from early on by talented and imaginative civil servants and diplomats in both Ireland and Britain who forged strong bonds with each other; it came to fruition in the series of statements and manifestos that began with the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and proceeded through the Downing Street Declaration to the Belfast Agreement. For Britain and Ireland to follow a joint line on the status and future of Northern Ireland, delegating to its inhabitants the autonomy to shape their future, seems in 2014 only a matter of sense; but 30-odd years ago it looked like very long odds indeed.  Accompanying this process, and the mutual respect of mandarins, diplomats and politicians that survived the litany of crises and horrors through the 1970s and 1980s, were other, unconnected phenomena. One was Ireland's enthusiastic embrace of Europe, and the transformed status this brought in terms of diplomatic and political relations. Another was the growing confidence, fashionability and influence of the Irish cultural presence in Britain. Irish actors, novelists, musicians, playwrights have scooped major prizes and awards and at certain points seemed to dominate the London scene (as anyone recently trying to get tickets for the revival of The Weir or Olwen Fou^8r^8's performance of riverrun can testify).  Changed profile of the Irish in BritainThis was a syndrome established long before, when Irish cultural entrepreneurs wielded surprising influence in the worlds of Victorian theatre and journalism - very far from any stereotype of ""Paddy the entertainer"". But from the 1990s, in conjunction with the less laudable and less enduring effects of the economic boom years, it entered a new dimension, and the export of Irish culture, along with the inrush of Irish money, changed the profile of the Irish in Britain for good.  The President's visit also speaks to, and reflects, the sense of identity among the Irish living in Britain. For those of us in London the atmosphere at receptions in the Irish Embassy, local gatherings in the Irish centres such as those in Camden and Hammersmith, or the Fleadh in Finsbury Park, is not that of mournful diaspora or the regrets of a disadvantaged community in exile. The ease with which Irish people settle in Britain - and vice versa - reflects not only a long and shared, if tangled, history. The kind of Anglo-Irish relations that are symbolised by reciprocal state visits, that are as enthusiastically embraced as the queen's and the President's, suggest the two countries finally see each other as indeed separate but equal, in a mutually fulfilling relationship. Nearly as good as sex.   Roy Foster is Carroll Professor of Irish history at the University of Oxford ",0
The Irish Times,Apr-09,2016,"April 9, 2016","THE MASAI CONUNDRUM; Preserving the Masai way of life in Tanzania is a complicated task, especially where it conflicts with environmental concerns and women's rights","At the Paris climate talks before Christmas, the former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern heralded the end of what he called the fake horse race between the twin goals of tackling climate change on the one hand and eradicating poverty on the other. In his conceptually neat view the COP21 agreement, in which 195 nations, led by the United States and China, agreed to cut emissions in order to limit global warming, will involve no economic cost. In the savannah and highlands of northern Tanzania, reducing poverty while preserving the environment is a high-wire act.  Twelve million Tanzanians live in dire poverty despite economic growth of 7 per cent last year. A large population - 47 million people - a high birth rate, and an economy based largely on subsistence farming mean that pastoralists, smallholders, commercial farmers and game reserves are competing for land. This is all happening amid rising temperatures brought about by global trends, uncertain rains and vanishing tree cover.  In 2012 Nasa warned that the ice cap that crowns Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro, could disappear by 2020. The volcanic Mount Meru, 80km to the west, has been mostly ice free since the 1960s. Today the people who live and work on its slopes feel the heat very keenly indeed. ""It's much warmer around here now than in the 1970s, even in the early 1990s,"" says Ernest Kaaya. A small farmer in the Luguruki ward of Arumeru district, with two wives and 10 children, the 66-year-old is a genial, paternal figure in the small community. ""The snow on the mountain disappeared decades ago,"" he says. ""Until recently a lot of the trees on the mountains were being cleared by the villagers, but the government stopped it."" While climate change affects the mountains' ice caps, forestry has been blamed for robbing the slopes of moisture. Kaaya started a small tree nursery in 2011, selling jacaranda saplings for about 8 cent each, after being trained by Cedesota, a community organisation funded by Irish Aid, via Care International. ""After the seminar I started growing trees so locals could plant on their farms on the mountain, to help the soil,"" he says. ""Now the conflict with the government is over. It's my ambition to spread the training, because it's good for everybody. It's very easy to erode the soil on the mountain without trees, and the trees provide shade."" Kaaya is also part of a co-op that exports avocados, papayas, coffee, beans and timber. In addition to nurseries and cash crops, Cedesota has helped the locals, who come from the Meru and Masai tribes, to mitigate the depredations of drought by keeping poultry and goats. ""It opened my mind: chickens are like insurance when there's no rain,"" says Rosemary Mosembise, a 37-year-old who runs a small restaurant from a tiny shack. ""My firstborn is in secondary school because of the money I get from selling chickens."" The tuition costs 1.2million Tanzanian shillings a year, about EUR 500 - a sizeable sum. Northern highlands  Compared with the tropical south and the arid interior, Tanzania's northern highlands are blessed with rich soils and a superb, relatively cool climate despite being just shy of the equator.  In the area around Luguruki village, where I visit small irrigated plots of coffee, avocados, papayas and bananas, I pass oxen pulling ploughs, fields teeming with corn, and plantations of beans and peas.  ""They are poor people here - they live in the mountains - but they know how to use the land,"" says Jackson Muro of Cedesota. ""They take their cows' manure to fertilise the crops, and the cows eat fodder. There is no grazing here, because there is no space to graze. It's mainly agroforestry."" Here, at least, among Meru tribespeople, economic development seems to go hand in hand with looking after the land. Farther north and west, near the vast Serengeti plain, Masai communities practise pastoralism. Although the government officially encourages agriculture as more economically and environmentally sound, no crops or trees are planted on the plains to the west and north of Arusha, the regional centre. Instead Masai pastoralists drive cattle across them in ever-increasing numbers. Although the vast majority of Irish Government aid to Tanzania goes on health services and nutrition, Irish Aid policy is to support the pastoralist way of life. To experience it at first hand I travel to Loliondo, in the heartland of Masai territory, on the border with Kenya. The 360km journey takes about 10 hours - the route includes deeply rutted tracks - but we sweep through the sunlit uplands of Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a Unesco World Heritage site where Masai herdsmen share green pasture with wildebeest, zebras, giraffes and elands. The vast lands north of the conservation area, around Loliondo, are also populated by Masai tribes, although wildlife is not afforded the same protection here. In the boma, or fenced village, of Enguserosambu I meet Masai widows who, in 2014, were part of a group that received 100 cows funded by Irish Aid via Palisep, a local group. Robert Kamakia of Palisep explains how they help the women produce and market their dairy produce.  A Masai, Kamakia admits that work among the tribe to combat female genital mutilation, forced marriage and a widespread denial of the existence of sexually transmitted diseases has a long way to go. Customarily forbidden from remarrying or owning land, Masai widows are usually shunned by the community and even by their own families. Nanyikai-Sironet, who is 48, says that her late husband's alcoholism frittered away their resources and that she suffered dire social exclusion for not owning cattle. ""When I received the cow from Ireland I was so happy. It was the end of a very dark time. It was the first time I ever owned livestock. Things are changing, but very slowly,"" she says of the deeply patriarchical Masai society. After another hour's drive we come to the boma of Ngarwa, about 10 huts overlooking a marshy plain. I meet Noosupuia-Kosiom, a 24-year-old who was widowed five years ago, when her husband died in battle. After she sold her remaining livestock to feed her two children she was forced to work part-time as a labourer, collecting firewood and water. ""It was very difficult having nothing. Since receiving my cow from Irish Aid"" - via Oxfam - ""people here treat me completely differently."" Sagging, grey, grassless land  Although flies swarm around us and the cattle, the land is lush and green up here in the far north, and some areas show bursts of agriculture. Not so between Karatu and Arusha, where the sagging, grey and often grassless land shows, even at the end of the rainy season, the effects of overgrazing.  Local officials say that pure pastoralism is unsustainable in the long term, as nomadic herders require much more land than the agroforesters of the Arumeru region. Given the Masai's staggering birth rate - the population has more than doubled in less than 30 years - there is huge pressure on the land in many areas. Oxfam has called for the Masai lifestyle to be embraced as a response to climate change, because of the Masai's experience of living in arid bushland. Yet the rapid growth in the Masai population, and subsequent overgrazing, is one reason why some previously fertile lands have turned to desert.  This article was supported by the Simon Cumbers Media Fund Mental health: the culture is to repress and suppress  The population pressure in northern Tanzania is especially evident in Arusha, whose population estimates put at anything from 500,000 to two million. A city who bustle is partly due to its status as a safari staging post, Arusha consists mostly of slum dwellings, wooden or earthen shacks with neither running water nor electricity. The area around Esso Road is among the fastest-growing slums in east Africa. Evanna Lyons, a Meath woman, sees the problems first hand in her work as a psychotherapist at Arusha Mental Health Trust, the city's sole mental-health clinic. ""The patients we see have no words for depression, anxiety or stress. Emotive words like 'sad', 'hurt' and 'angry' are not used a lot,"" she says. ""The culture is to repress and suppress; a lot of members of the community can by silenced for the greater good. ""They find it hard to express feelings and report a lot of psychosomatic symptoms. You might have someone say they have a pain in their head, and then you find out their father died in front of them a few weeks beforehand."" Arusha Mental Health Trust was founded in 2000 by another Irishwoman, Dr Sheila Devane. Last year Minister of State Sean Sherlock awarded EUR 10,000 to fund a psychotherapy education programme on sexual abuse. ""As part of the programme we train ward officers, social workers, nurses, teachers, religious workers and orphanage staff on the dangers of various physical, mental and emotional abuse,"" says Lyons, ""as well as abuse related to child development.""",0
The Irish Times,Aug-01,2007,01-Aug-07,Brown pushes aid for Africa to top of agenda,"BRITAIN: Gordon Brown said yesterday that he had galvanised world leaders including US president George Bush and leading companies to combat what he described as the global emergency of deepening poverty in Africa.   The British prime minister disclosed that since entering No 10 he has persuaded 14 world leaders and 21 companies to sign a declaration that the world is not on track to meet its ambitious millennium development goals in 2015, and that efforts must be redoubled within a year. Mr Brown persuaded President Bush to sign up to the declaration yesterday, ensuring that he had garnered the support of all leaders of the G7 group of industrialised countries. His immediate aim is to convene a UN conference next year that brings together governments, businesses, faith groups and charities such as the Gates Foundation. He argues that this broader partnership has been one of the missing elements in the fight against poverty. Mr Brown launched his initiative in a speech at the UN in New York, hours after spending two days with Mr Bush, who has been deeply sceptical about the UN. The prime minister met former president Bill Clinton on Monday to discuss his plan, another sign that he is prepared to work with leading figures inside and outside the White House. He adopted the language of rock star Bono to tell a meeting of ambassadors in New York: ""It is time to call it what it is: a development emergency which needs emergency action. If 30,000 children died needlessly and avoidably every day in America or Britain, we would call it an emergency, and an emergency is what it is."" The UN set its millennium development goals in 2000, with targets for 2015 covering issues such as poverty, primary education and infant mortality. ""Seven years on it is already clear that our pace is too slow, our direction too uncertain and our vision at risk,"" Mr Brown said. ""The calendar says we are halfway from 2000 to 2015. But the reality is that we are a million miles away from success."" He hoped to call a meeting of the UN next year to see what progress had been made in creating what he described as ""the greatest coalition of conscience in pursuit of the greatest of causes"". Mr Brown said that he wanted to mobilise what some people called ""soft power"". ""I call it 'people power' - people power in the support of the leadership of developing countries."" Mr Brown's officials say it is not a lack of scientific, economic or development knowledge that is holding back progress, but largely a lack of political will. Mr Brown secured his first foreign policy victory last night as the UN Security Council voted unanimously to back an Anglo-French proposal to deploy a 26,000-strong international force to Darfur with a mandate to stop the killings that have displaced nearly two million people. British officials had earlier said that China's opposition had been overcome, setting in motion the dispatch of international peacekeepers that has been delayed for a year while the bloodshed in western Sudan continued. Mr Brown described it as ""the greatest humanitarian disaster the world faces today. More than 200,000 dead, two million displaced and four million on food aid."" Under the Darfur resolution, which Mr Brown hammered out with French president Nicolas Sarkozy, and for which he secured the support of Mr Bush, a joint force of 19,555 soldiers will be established by the UN and the African Union, along with more than 6,000 police officers from around the world. The force will set up an operational headquarters by the end of October and reach full strength by the end of the year, when it will take over from the small African Union force in Darfur. Crucially, the force will have a more muscular mandate than the African troops, who have been powerless to intervene in the ethnic cleansing of local people by militias sponsored by Khartoum. The force will be deployed under chapter seven of the UN charter, giving it the right to use force to carry out its mission, to deliver humanitarian supplies and protect civilians. Most of the troops will come from African countries, with Nigeria, Uganda and Rwanda among the major contributors, but elements will come from around the world, including a team of Chinese engineers who will build the base. Although Britain tabled the resolution, Mr Brown's aides said Britain would contribute few troops, but provide as much as £100 million (EUR 148 million) in logistical and economic support. Mr Brown said yesterday that if the killings continued he and others would ""redouble our efforts to impose further sanctions"".  ",0
The Irish Times,Aug-01,2008,01-Aug-08,Weighing anchor,"THE FRIDAY INTERVIEW/Michael Hanahoe, Dun Laoghaire Harbour Company :'THE HARBOUR was part of my playground when I was growing up,"" says Michael Hanahoe, chief executive of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company, gesturing toward the Harbour Lodge board room window and out into the murky day beyond. ""One of my first jobs was carrying the bags of people coming off the mail boat whose destination was my mother's guesthouse in Rosmeen Gardens. So for me, being offered the job in the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company was like coming home,"" he says. But Hanahoe is about to say goodbye to the harbour, having handed in his notice as head of the State-owned commercial entity that oversees its development and heritage. ""It's time to move on,"" says Hanahoe, 62, who has held the position since the company was set up in 1997, a result of the 1996 Harbours Act that corporatised Ireland's major harbours. The timing of his exit was prompted by the collapse of a planned major development of the harbour's Carlisle Pier, which included more than 200 apartments, a 127-bed hotel and a retail walkway. In May, Sisk Builders, one of the scheme's partners, pulled out, citing an uncertain economy and planning risks. It was ""a big disappointment"" for Hanahoe, who had agreed to stay on so that he could see the scheme through at least until the planning stage: ""When that project fell through, I decided it was time for me to go."" The plans were not without controversy. A Save Our Seafront campaign was mounted by the activist Richard Boyd Barrett, who described it as a ""shameful"" attempt to privatise a public space and make it the ""exclusive property of the super-wealthy"". It was also very expensive. A Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council special zoning objective called for both landmark architecture of international significance and a national cultural attraction to be built on the pier. ""We ended up with a scheme that was going to cost up to EUR 150 million. That meant that there had to be a sizeable commercial element to the scheme to pay for the non-commercial elements. The project was always marginal and with the downturn, it just killed it off altogether."" Downturns and controversies aside, the harbour company is looking at alternative plans for the pier, although there are no specific proposals in place yet. ""Something is definitely going to have to be done,"" says Hanahoe. So what about the objections? ""Carlisle Pier is a public space, but it's never been a publicly accessible space. For 150 years, it was a ferry terminal for the mail boat and the only people allowed on the pier were passengers from the boat. For the last 10 years, it has been a derelict site in the middle of the harbour, accessible to nobody."" The now scrapped plans had included significant public access, he adds, and any new plan will have to do the same - and wash its face financially, of course. Commercial activities in the harbour allow the company to finance improvements to public facilities, he insists. These include a EUR 5 million outlay on resurfacing the 1,300 metre-long east pier. But it is ""a balancing act"". Overcommercialisation would ""risk damaging the atmosphere, the ambience"". Last year, commercial activities generated turnover of EUR 10.7 million, up 4 per cent, but this masks a 2 per cent decline in shipping revenues from the harbour's only ferry operator, Stena Line. Shipping revenues have dropped over the last six or seven years as the cheap flights era took hold and the elimination of duty-free inspired ""booze cruises"" in 1998 didn't help. But ""a slight reversal"" is now happening and passenger numbers, at about 1 million a year, are levelling off. The future of Dún Laoghaire as a ferry port depends on more than just passenger interest, however. It depends on Stena Line. The ferry operator's contract runs out in 2011 and talks have begun. ""Our primary concern is to get a long-term commitment from Stena Line to the port that will extend to the next generation of fast ferries,"" says Hanahoe. He hopes that the contract will be renewed before he steps down at the end of next April. But with 60 per cent of the company's revenues still coming from Stena Line, its profitable future is predicated on keeping the ferries coming. ""If it's not Stena Line, then it has to be somebody else,"" he says. Hanahoe's commercial nous springs from his career history, which encompasses a 17-year spell as finance director of pharma group Warner Lambert, from where he was recruited by the harbour company's first chairman, One51's Philip Lynch. ""We had been organisationally part of the civil service and he was determined to inculcate an enterprise culture into the company... so I think he was anxious to get somebody who understood the numbers,"" says Hanahoe. As an avid reader of history, he also has a natural affinity to the company's heritage role. Construction on the harbour began in 1816 and was completed in 1840. It was originally conceived as a refuge for boats resting at anchor while they waited for the tide to allow them up the Liffey. As the steam age arrived, Dún Laoghaire developed as the Irish end for passenger and mail traffic between Ireland and Britain. ""The proud boast of the City of Dublin Steam Packet company, which ran the service at the time, was that you could travel from the second city of the empire to the first city of the empire without getting your feet wet,"" says Hanahoe. Isaac Butt and Charles Stewart Parnell used the service, while Michael Collins and his team left Ireland from Dún Laoghaire in 1922 to negotiate the Free State treaty. For most of the 20th century, the port was associated with mass emigration, when economic gloom forced people abroad. The economy's current dive into recession, while it may have helped sink the Carlisle Pier scheme, won't scuttle proposals to construct an additional 900-berth marina (there are 833 berths in the existing marina, making it the largest in Ireland). The final decision won't be taken until 2009 and it could then take up to five years to build, at which point it will be ready to ""accommodate demand from the Celtic Tiger Mark II"". Hanahoe is a member of the new Dublin Bay Task Force, a group set up in July to draw up a ""sustainable vision"" for the future use of the entire bay area, from Howth Head to Dalkey. ""It's important that we get the emphasis right. Flora and fauna is important. Bird life is important. But the Bay is also important as a public amenity. Some of the ideas, like a Sandycove to Sutton cycleway, I think are wonderful."" The big question, which will be examined by a separate Government study, is what happens to Dublin Port. Some observers believe it should be moved, perhaps to Bremore in north Dublin, where the Drogheda Port Company plans to build a new port in partnership with private interests. ""What happens to Dublin Port is not something I want to get involved in, you know. That's a matter for Dublin Port management and the Government."" With two grandchildren having just learned to walk, and consequently ""doing everything at 100 miles per hour"", Hanahoe has other things to keep him occupied. ""Lots of people would not see giving up a pensionable public service job in the middle of a recession as being a smart career move, but my focus in the future is not going to be on the jobs market."" Name:Michael Hanahoe. Position:Chief executive, Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. Age:62. Lives:Blackrock, Co Dublin. Family:Married to Margaret, they have three daughters and two grandchildren. Background and education:He was born in Northern Ireland but grew up in Dún Laoghaire, attending the Presentation College in Glasthule. He got a B.Comm at University College Dublin. Career:He trained as a certified accountant at Unilever in Britain, where he worked for six years. He was also chief accountant for the Irish Press group ""in the days that they were making money"" and was finance director for tractor makers Massey Ferguson and pharmaceutical group Warner Lambert (now part of Pfizer). He joined the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company in 1997. Interests:He plays tennis and is a big fan of the Leinster rugby team. His love of history includes a special interest in Romanesque and Gothic church architecture. Something you might expect:He is proud of the harbour's historical legacy and describes it as ""one of the finest man-made harbours in the world"" and an ""extraordinary architectural and engineering achievement"". Something that might surprise:He had no nautical experience when he was recruited as the harbour company's top man.",0
The Irish Times,Aug-01,2009,01-Aug-09,A liberal accord with Nazism?,"HISTORY:Living with Hitler: Liberal Democrats in the Third Reichby Eric Kurlander, Yale University Press, 291pp, £25. The failure of liberals to vigorously oppose the Nazis shows how easily democracy can be destroyed in a time of economic hardship MARCH 23RD, 1933, marked the day the Weimar Republic, arguably one of the most liberal states in history, ceased to exist. On that day, the German Reichstag voluntarily authorised a permanent state of emergency that would form the legal basis of the Nazi dictatorship. The infamous Enabling Law, passed with an overwhelming two-thirds majority, granted the recently appointed Reich Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, the power to enact legislation without prior consent of the parliament. Only the Social Democrats voted against the law, despite the terror and intimidation they had experienced over the previous weeks. Their honourable defiance came at a high price. Shortly after the party s chairman, Otto Wels, told the Nazi-dominated parliament that you can take our freedom and our lives, but you cannot take away our honour , he lost his German citizenship and was forced to leave the country. NOT EVERYONE HAD the courage and determination to confront the Nazis in this way, and among those who voted for the Enabling Law were the last five remaining liberal MPs. What drove these liberals to effectively abandon the Weimar constitution which they themselves had helped to create? And how did liberal democrats survive under the Nazi dictatorship? These are the questions Eric Kurlander addresses in his stimulating new book, Living With Hitler. To be sure, many prominent Weimar liberals such as Albert Einstein, Heinrich Mann, or the Nobel Peace Laureate Ludwig Quidde, chose to leave the country after Hitler s seizure of power. They knew they had no future in the New Germany. German-Jewish liberal intellectuals, in particular, fled the country in large numbers, notably to the US and to Britain. Others, less willing or able to pursue the often difficult and uncertain path into exile, chose to go into inner emigration , a complete withdrawal from public life. Although deprived of political office, the future first President of the Federal Republic, Theodor Heuss, and Germany s leading feminist of the 1920s, Gertrud Bäumer, continued to live in Nazi Germany until the bitter end. As liberal members of parliament in 1933, both of them had voted for the Enabling Law. Yet foreign exile and inner emigration were not the only possible choices facing liberals in the Third Reich. Some former democrats, such as the president of the German Reichsbank until 1939, Hjalmar Schacht, and the first head of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels, even held important offices under Hitler, although they became increasingly marginalised when the Nazis consolidated their power. In exploring the complex relationship between liberalism and Nazism, Kurlander makes a number of important observations: first, he argues that bourgeois liberals could live quite comfortably under Hitler. They encountered far less systematic repression and terror than the real or perceived enemies of Nazism: communists and socialists, or the allegedly racially inferior. As long as they remained politically inactive or indeed proved willing to collaborate with the new authorities, there was no need for the Gestapo to persecute them. Liberal democrats could be seen as misguided idealists, led astray by the evil influence of Jews. Second, and perhaps more controversially, Kurlander insists there were certain ideological continuities between German left-liberalism and Nazism, continuities that made political accommodation, and in some cases outright collaboration, with the Nazis more attractive than one might expect. Even though most German liberals were horrified by the violent implementation of Hitler s dystopian fantasies, Kurlander argues that there existed, at least initially, somecommon ground between both movements. He emphasises foreign policy particularly the goals of revising the Treaty of Versailles and restoring German hegemony in central Europe as an area in which liberals and Nazis could agree in principle. After all, one of the most prominent proponents of the geopolitical idea of a German-led economic sphere in central Europe was Friedrich Naumann, the first chairman of the German Democratic Party and author of the liberal imperialist manifesto, Mitteleuropa. Ever since the late 19th century, Kurlander suggests, German liberals had subscribed to völkisch ideas of ethnicity, an anti-universalist conception of national identity that differed substantially from British or French liberalism. Kurlander s argument that German liberalism was, in some ways, an ideological and sociological antecedent of Nazism, could be seen as an attempt to revive the old German Sonderwegthesis, the notion that Germany s deviant path towards modernity explains the rise of Nazism. Such an interpretation, based on a rigid dichotomy between universalist western liberalism and its völkischGerman counterpart, will not convince everyone. The history of British and French colonialism, which bears strong structural similarities with the kind of German domination over central Europe that Friedrich Naumann and other pre-1933 liberals had in mind, raises the question of how different German völkischliberalism really was. Both in Britain and in France, liberals could be strong advocates of civil liberties at home while strenuously denying the same rights to their colonial subjects. British liberalism may have been universalist in rhetoric, but it was hardly so in practice. Scientific racism and the drive for economic exploitation of colonial peoples were a common pattern in late-19th- and early-20th-century European history, and certainly not a German peculiarity. WHILE KURLANDER places great emphasis on the long-term continuity of liberal völkischideas, he tends to downplay the situational pressures that confronted liberal democrats in the early 1930s. Nazi terror and intimidation placed great pressures on liberal MPs whose refusal to pass the Enabling Law would have been no more than a heroic gesture without any real political consequences. More importantly, however, electoral support for liberal parties had virtually disappeared under the impact of the Great Depression. Not only in Germany, but in most of Europe, parliamentary democracy seemed an outdated model of political organisation. The future, so it seemed, belonged to the totalitarian ideologies of fascism and communism. If confronted with a choice between those two, liberals did indeed see greater commonalities with the Nazis than with the KPD. Despite his overemphasis on long-term continuities, Kurlander is right in pointing out that the history of left liberals in the Third Reich has been ignored for too long. The story of German liberalism s collapse in the wake of the Great Depression continues to be highly relevant. The failure of Weimar republicans to vigorously oppose the rise of Nazism demonstrates how easily a liberal democracy can succumb to a totalitarian movement, particularly at a time of severe economic recession when confidence in the values of liberalism and free-market capitalism is shaken to its very foundations.

The Irish Times,Aug-11,2011,11-Aug-11,Bank of England warns of 'sluggish' growth as it cuts GDP projection,"UK ECONOMY:THE CONTINUING squeeze on UK household incomes will ensure sluggish growth in the near term, the Bank of England warned yesterday as it cut its central projection for gross domestic product growth for next year from 2.5 per cent to nearer 2 per cent. In its quarterly inflation report, the central bank said there was a good chance that inflation would reach as high as 5 per cent this year, and that the timing and extent of the subsequent decline in inflation were highly uncertain. Gilts futures soared after the report s publication, in a sign that investors believe the bank s rate-setting monetary policy committee will keep the bank rate at its record low of 0.5 per cent for longer. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King was reluctant for the bank to follow the US Federal Reserve s lead in making a conditional commitment to keep rates on hold until a set date. However, he noted there was no obvious argument for the bank to do so, because markets were not pricing in a rate rise until early 2013. The governor also signalled that the bank was unlikely to raise rates until the spread between banks lending rates and the bank rate which is far wider than usual narrowed. Any narrowing of the spread is likely to be delayed by banks need to deleverage. Another round of quantitative easing was unlikely unless price pressures subsided to the point that inflation looked set to fall below target, he said. The report said the best collective judgment of the members of the monetary policy committee was that following some near-term weakness, GDP growth was likely to pick up gradually, so that by 2014 it would be more likely to be above its historical average than below it. However, Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean said there was now less margin for rapid growth before inflation picks up than before the crisis, implying that the bank believes the crisis has hit the UK economy s potential output.  The weaker growth outlook, the substantial downside risks and the sharper expected decline in inflation suggest that rates will be on hold for a lot longer, said Jens Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets. Michael Saunders of Citigroup said: The forecasts imply a long period of low interest rates, although the governor was reluctant to echo the Fed s conditional commitment.  In the medium term, inflation was about as likely to be below as above target , the report said. It said inflation had a good chance of reaching 5 per cent this year because of utility price rises and the continuing effect of the increases in VAT, oil and other import prices. Inflation was likely to fall back during 2012 and into 2013 as those effects waned and downward pressure from slack in the labour market persisted. But this decline was likely to be mitigated by some upward pressure on wages in response to the sustained period of high inflation. (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2011)",1

The company, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from outside the UK, said underlying profit rose to £32.4 million ($42.05 million) for the six months to June 30th, from £25.5 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 per cent to £714.4 million, the company said. It raised its interim dividend by 6 per cent to 4.65 pence. Its shares were up 3.6 per cent in early trade. The company said it expected full-year performance would be in line with expectations, although highlighting that it continued to trade in an ""environment of ongoing political and economic uncertainty"". It said the measures taken by the Hong Kong government to cool its property market were likely to affect volumes in the second half, while the British residential market continued to face uncertainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. ""In May 2017, the Hong Kong government implemented further cooling measures which are likely to have an impact,"" the company said. Income from residential transactions in Asia increased by 23 per cent to £20.1 million, driven by 84 per cent sales growth in Hong Kong. Underlying profits from its British residential transaction business fell by 27 per cent to £5.4 million. Overall, however, Savills' UK business reported a 7 per cent rise in revenue as its consultancy services offset the impact of reduced volumes in its residential business. The UK housing market, which has slowed since the EU referendum, has been further hit by a rise in stamp duty and an uncertain outcome in the June election. - (Reuters)",0
The Irish Times,Aug-13,2012,13-Aug-12,Nama assigns receivers to Robert Butler companies,"THE NATIONAL Asset Management Agency (Nama) has appointed receivers to a series of companies controlled by Limerick developer Robert Butler. The national agency has appointed Michael Miland and Des Lennon of Jones Lang Lasalle as statutory receivers to 15 companies in the Robert Butler construction group. Established 30 years by chairman Robert Butler, the group s development portfolio includes substantial properties in the Shannon Free Zone and the National Technology Park in Limerick. Part of the group s property portfolio is the former Anglo Irish Bank House at Limerick s Henry Street. The group s website describes itself as one of the leading Irish commercial property development firms . Earlier this year, a palatial residential property built for Mr Butler at Adare sold for EUR 1.9 million EUR 10 million less than its original asking price of EUR 12 million in 2008. The latest accounts filed by the group in May of this year showed that at the end of August 2010, 14 companies had an overall net deficit of EUR 43.7 million. The companies listed to have a receiver appointed include Robert Butler Holdings Ltd, Robert Butler (Investments) Ltd, Playa Investments Ltd, Mount Kennett Developments Ltd, Robert Butler Group Ltd, Robert Butler Realty Ltd, Dooradoyle BT Properties, Bluefort Properties and Millgrove Properties Ltd. In its latest accounts for Robert Butler Group Ltd, auditors PGL from Clonskeagh, Dublin 14, provided a disclaimer on the view given in the financial statements because of the limited audit evidence available. The auditors state: With respect to net inter-group receivables of EUR 20 million and provision thereon of EUR 10.9 million, the evidence available to us regarding recovery was limited because of the financial position of the company in view of the extent of its bank indebtedness and that of the group as a whole.  While the directors consider the carrying amounts are reasonable to the best of their ability, due to the continuing uncertain financial and economic conditions, the availability of funding from its finance providers and the adverse impact on the company s investments in its subsidiary companies and related inter-company debt, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence, particularly regarding the valuation and recovery of inter-group receivables, by using other audit procedures.  The largest loss among Mr Butler s companies was recorded by Mount Kennett Developments Ltd, which sustained a loss of EUR 14.4 million, resulting in accumulated losses of EUR 17.7 million at the end of August 2010. The loss mainly arose from a writedown in stocks from EUR 13.7 million to EUR 870,185. A note attached to the returns made by Robert Butler Group Ltd confirms that the firm had net liabilities of EUR 18 million. The figures show the firm has bank loans totalling EUR 22.3 million, and the accounts state that Mr Butler had provided a letter guaranteeing the borrower s liability for a specified amount.",1
The Irish Times,Aug-14,2019,14-Aug-19,When Boris meets Leo,"Sir, - A hard Brexit seems more probable as each day passes with the UK government hell bent on exiting the EU come hell or high water.  It seems to me that now is the time for straight talking from our Taoiseach when he meets the UK prime minister Boris Johnson. He could point out to Boris Johnson that any delay in getting an agreed withdrawal is not the fault of the EU negotiators who, for some time now, had the agreed terms done and dusted and are still awaiting ratification from the UK on the matter.  Mr Johnson could be told in no uncertain manner that if they decide to crash out without a deal that the economic hardship visited on this country will be considerable but not as great as that which the UK will have to endure.  Sooner or later a groundswell of opposition to the Brexit process will emerge and those who were mistakenly convinced or perfidiously misled into believing that Brexit is best, will have their revenge, either at the ballot box or on the streets or both. Things could get very ugly if food or medical shortages happen, with social unrest and political upheaval being the order of the day.  Our Taoiseach could explain that another referendum will most probably be demanded following a couple of years of hardship.  If they are let back into Europe the UK would then have to accept the euro as their currency and pay billions in restitution to Ireland and the EU for the economic damage done to us by the Brexit process. They would also have to agree to be bound by European laws without the derogations they now enjoy.  Straight talking might bring Boris Johnson to his senses, if only from a sense of self preservation. - Yours, etc, BOBBY CARTY,  Templeogue,  Dublin 6W.",0
The Irish Times,Aug-15,2008,15-Aug-08,Factory to close with loss of 44 jobs,"AN ANNOUNCEMENT that more than 40 staff are to lose their jobs at a manufacturing plant in south Co Tipperary has been described as another massive blow to the area by local politicians. Ardfinnan-based insulation manufacturer Moy Isover yesterday confirmed it is to close its plant in the village after 35 years with the loss of 44 jobs. In a statement, the company said it regretted the decision, which was taken as a direct result of the downturn in the construction sector. Fine Gael TD for Tipperary South Tom Hayes said it was terrible news for Ardfinnan, which has depended on Moy Isover as a major employer for many years. ""The workers have my fullest sympathy as they now have to find work in the midst of a serious recession. They face a very uncertain future with the rising cost of living and a dwindling jobs market,"" he said. Senator Phil Prendergast (Labour) said south Tipperary has been hit particularly hard by job losses recently, with lays-offs at a number of major employers in the area, such as Bulmers and radiator manufacturer Barlows. She said the numbers on the county's live register had risen by 39 per cent in the last 12 months. Ms Prendergast said the Moy Isover staff were the latest victims of the Government's mishandling of the economy. ""I am calling on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make the search for a replacement industry an absolute priority,"" she said.",0
The Irish Times,Aug-15,2012,15-Aug-12,Many charities all too dependent on State aid in an uncertain climate of shrinking resources,"ANALYSIS:BARNARDOS ISN T alone in facing financial difficulties. Many charities across the State are experiencing a double whammy of reductions in income just as demand for services is soaring. After expanding in an era where Government funding and public donations seemed plentiful, much of the sector is adjusting to an uncertain world where shrinking resources and survival are the name of the game. Many may not last the pace. That was the chilling conclusion of Grant Thornton s 2012 Not-for-Profit Survey. Based on a survey of 990 charities earlier this year, it concluded the number of charities and non-profit organisations in Ireland was likely to drop in coming years, with one in 10 at risk of folding as they did not have the funds to plan beyond the next six months. Many were dangerously dependent on State aid. Of the groups surveyed, Government funding was nearly twice as important as voluntary fundraising. Some 60 per cent said their funding mainly came from the State and 34 per cent from voluntary contributions. Aside from planning for the future, financing current activities was a significant concern for the charities surveyed. Nearly one in three cited day-to-day funding pressures as the most challenging issue facing their operation. Why does this matter? For one, many of these charities and non-profit bodies play a vital role. In all there are an estimated 7,900 charitable, community and voluntary groups of all kinds scattered around the country. In many cases they deliver public services for children, older people and those with disabilities on behalf of the State, ensuring vulnerable people have a minimum level of income and have access to the type of supports that allow them to live with dignity. The Wheel, a support organisation for hundreds of charities, community groups and social enterprises, says the sector is under increasing strain and expects to see significant changes in coming years. Chief executive Deirdre Garvey says many will need to explore new ways of cutting costs such as collaborative working and sharing of costs. This may be a blessing in disguise. Take suicide prevention charities, for example. There are hundreds of such groups, dozens of different counselling services, numerous different support phonelines and websites. The scale is impressive, but it is also deeply fragmented and isolated. Many groups are very often not sharing their experiences or working together to improve support or training, meaning State funding for suicide prevention groups about EUR 5 million this year may not be delivering the value for money it could be. Most of all, it means we are not being as effective as we could be in reducing the number of people taking their own lives. As a result, the Health Service Executive s national office for suicide prevention has been prioritising funding for groups willing to work in partnership with others. We re likely to see more of this kind of approach for State agencies in years ahead. If the economic situation is bleak, at least it s encouraging to see that we re still in relative terms a generous country. Figures released earlier this year showed Ireland was ranked the most charitable country in Europe and the second most charitable nation in the world. The World Giving index, compiled by the Charities Aid Foundation, found some 75 per cent of Irish people donated money to charity, while almost 40 per cent volunteered their time each month. There are simple steps that charities can take to help ensure they not only survive but operate more effectively. A report into fundraising in Ireland by the not-for-profit consultancy group 2into3 found charities which invested in good corporate governance were faring particularly well, despite the challenging circumstances. Its advice to other charities? Strengthen boards of management, realign fundraising strategies in line with new economic realities and invest in fundraising. Below are salaries from a selection of organisations: Amnesty International Ireland chief executive Colm O'Gorman EUR 115,832; Barnardos chief executive Fergus Finlay EUR 113,315 (in 2011 he donated EUR 35,000 in other earnings to Barnardos); Concern chief executive Tom Arnold earns EUR 132,000; Goal, outgoing chief executive John O'Shea. His salary is not known but 2010 accounts show two executives were paid some EUR 100,000; Irish Hospice Foundation chief executive Sharon Foley EUR 101,350; ISPCC chief executive Ashley Balbirnie. A board decision was made earlier this year not to release the figure; Simon Community head of national office Patrick Quinn, EUR 75,000; St Vincent de Paul national director Kieran Murphy EUR 115,000-EUR 125,000.",1
The Irish Times,Aug-16,2012,16-Aug-12,Sale of bonds positive - Fitch,"THE GOVERNMENT S recent bond sales have added to the country s positive momentum but market confidence remained extremely fragile and a deepening of the euro zone crisis could block Ireland s full return to markets, according to ratings agency Fitch. The agency does not expect losses to be imposed on sovereign bondholders if the State is unable to regain access to the bond markets in the near future. Should Ireland fail to fully regain access to the bond markets in the short term, we expect official creditors to extend fresh financing without bondholder bail-in because Ireland s programme has stayed broadly on track.  It said plans to issue sovereign annuity bonds improved the flexibility to borrow but it was still uncertain what degree of market access could be maintained when the EU-IMF bailout programme expired at the end of next year. It said there would be increased demand for Irish sovereign bonds from pension firms because the yields the country was paying made them attractive. Annuity bonds pay a steady flow of principal and interest linked to sovereign yields for up to 35 years. The National Treasury Management Agency has said it expects to raise between EUR 3 billion and EUR 5 billion over the next 18 months from sovereign annuity and inflation-linked bonds. Fitch, which has Ireland rated at investment grade of BBB+, said international investors accounted for 66 per cent of the recent bond swap and the sale of a new five-year bond and tapping of existing eight-year bonds. The Government raised EUR 4.2 billion of new money on the debt exchange in a surprise return to the bond markets and the first borrowing on longer-dated bonds since September 2010 and the bailout programme. Fitch said Ireland s credit rating and negative outlook, meaning a further downgrade is possible, reflected the fiscal deficit and the country s vulnerability as an export-driven economy to a deterioration in the euro crisis.  This contagion could come through worsening economic growth and falling demand for its debt. ",0
The Irish Times,Aug-16,2013,16-Aug-13,Shadow looms over plan to export solar power from Sahara to Europe; The Desertec project has cooled following a split over when to begin sending natural energy from Africa to Europe,"The plan was as obvious as it was daring: to harness the sun over the Sahara Desert and supply Europe with an endless supply of clean energy. But now the Desertec project is falling apart, four years after its high-profile launch in Germany. Back in happier days, the confident Desertec consortium suggested it could solve Europe's growing energy problems by tapping the searing sun of the Sahara, where it said the sand is blasted with more energy in a few hours than the planet uses in a year. Desertec's idea: to establish massive solar farms on the verge of the Saharan desert and transmit the energy generated via high-tech, low-loss electricity cables beneath the Mediterranean Sea to Spain and the rest of the Europe. Now its EUR 600 million pilot project dubbed ""Sawian"" - co-operation in Arabic - faces an uncertain future due to, ironically enough, a breakdown in the co-operation between the consortium's partners. Multiple rows over corporate governance and strategic objectives wracked the group in recent months, prompting prominent partners such as Siemens and Bosch to retreat from the project. Of the 50 initial consortium partners, around 20 have left. The latest blow is the split between the two sides of the Desertec project: the non-profit Desertec foundation that developed the idea and the Desertec Industrial Initiative (Dii) charged with realising it. Both sides insist the project can still be realised - just not with each other. ""The world's deserts are large and still haven't been recognised as a significant source of energy or, in case of being recognised, they aren't used,"" the foundation said in a statement after its withdrawal. The foundation - a civil society group headed by scientists, politicians and economists - blames the break-down on a cultural clash between their own environmental and climate goals and ""aggressive industrial politics"" at the Dii consortium, where shareholders include Deutsche Bank, Munich Re and energy giants RWE and E.ON. ""It was always clear to us that it would be no easy task - rather full of challenges - to implement the idea of producing electricity in the earth's desserts,"" said Thiemo Gropp, a co-founder of the Desertec Foundation, to the S^;ddeutsche newspaper. The foundation, which came up with the Desertec name and concept, was particularly concerned about potential reputational damage thanks to corporate in-fighting at Dii's Munich headquarters. For months Dii executives had argued over how ambitious the initial stage of the North Africa project should be. Dii chief executive Paul van Son urged consortium members to accept a more modest launch: to get the solar parks running but to hold off on energy delivery to Europe. Since the launch of the project, he argued, Europe had experienced energy over-supply. That changed the fundamentals of Saharan solar energy exports, as well as the fact that Morocco is now importing energy from Europe to fill its own growing demands. In April van Son reportedly declared ""dead"" the plan to export Saharan solar energy to Europe, but his co-director insisted the company should stick to its two-pronged strategy of energy production and export to Europe. The row has been settled with the Dutch-born van Son victorious, but observers say the collateral damage - in particular the withdrawal of the Desertec Foundation's backing - can't be underestimated. ""We're not happy about the decision, but it does not affect the realisation of desert power in the Middle East or North Africa,"" said Klaus Schmidtke, Dii communications head. He insisted the project is ""very much alive"". Even if calm returns to the Munich-based company, it still faces considerable structural problems. For instance Spain, the key transit partner for the project, has refused to sign a declaration of intent to connect high-power voltage lines between Morocco and the rest of Europe. Talks are continuing at international level between Spain, France, Morocco and Germany. Meanwhile the interest of the German government - a key early backer of the project- has begun to wane because of the gloomy global economic outlook and political concerns over the stability of northern African countries. Now it appears likely that northern African countries will realise their own version among themselves of the project envisioned by the European consortium.  Morocco, one of the proposed locations of Desertec energy farms, is pushing ahead with plans to draw over 40 per cent of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade.  Alongside wind and hydropower, Morocco is pushing an ambitious plan to install solar plants with a combined output of 2.0 GW by 2020.

Bank stocks were among the worst performers across the board amid speculation that the European Central Bank will take an aggressive line next month as it unveils stimulus to reboot the euro zone economy and inflation.  The Iseq index lost 0.9 per cent to 5,679.77, falling below the 5,700-point level for the first time in seven months, while the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 0.3 per cent to 365.09.  DUBLIN Permanent TSB slid 4.8 per cent and Bank of Ireland fell 0.9 per cent to EUR 3.13, as sector followers fretted over the global economy, Brexit and the prospect of the ECB  cutting rates next month as part of a suite of stimulus measures. Low interest rates squeeze banks' lending margins.  Aryzta was also out of sorts, dropping 5.4 per cent to close at an all-time low of 64c, after UBS analyst Joern Iffert slashed his share price target and earnings forecasts for the baked goods company, saying weakening consumer confidence could hit its sales, while the timing of savings from a cost-cutting programme is uncertain.  House builders dropped, with Glenveagh Properties off 2.5 per cent and Cairn Homes down 1.9 per cent, as the market continued to digest news on Wednesday that property-price growth had eased to its slowest rate in six years in June.  LONDON The Ftse 100 shed 1.1 per cent to close at 7,067.01. Multiple factors were weighing on the index, chiefly a gloomy global economic mood after fears were raised that the UK and countries around the world could be heading for a recession. An inverted yield curve - where short-term government bonds become less attractive than long-term notes - in the UK and US has spooked markets over the past two sessions.  Energy and mining stocks in particular incurred heavy losses as oil and metal markets dropped on fears that demand would dwindle in a downturn. In company news, Ladbrokes owner GVC pushed its profit forecasts higher as its UK high street stores performed better than expected despite the clampdown on fixed-odds betting terminals. But shares slipped by 0.3 per cent to 545.2p. Royal Bank of Scotland saw shares plummet 10.5 per cent to 177.65p after two key brokers lowered their forecasts for the lender. EUROPE Weighing on the benchmark Stoxx 600 index the most was a drop in automakers and commodity stocks, the sectors that tend to fall the most during trade uncertainties due to their reliance on exports and demand from China. In earnings news, strong numbers from beer maker Carlsberg and food retailer ICA pushed shares of both companies to the top of the pan-region index. Shares in Danish facility services provider ISS were at the bottom, extend losses following quarterly results, with analysts pointing to concerns over free cash flow. NEW YORK US stocks were trying in mid-afternoon trade to recover from a steep sell-off a day earlier, as strong retail sales data and upbeat Walmart earnings eased concerns of a recession, but mixed signals on trade and Cisco's dismal forecast capped gains. Cisco Systems dropped after the Dow component blamed the bruising US-China trade war for poor quarterly forecasts. Walmart shares rose after the retailer reported second-quarter US comparable sales that beat estimates and boosted its earnings forecast for the year. The company's strong report lifted the wider consumer staples sector, which gave the biggest boost to the market. - Additional reporting, Reuters ",1
The Irish Times,Aug-17,2011,17-Aug-11,Train ticket price rise gives an issue to rail against,"LONDON BRIEFING:Commuters are bearing the brunt of a changed policy on fares. Rises may go as high as 13% AFTER NEGOTIATING the rush hour on Britain s overcrowded and underfinanced rail network, commuters arrived at their desks yesterday morning to more bad news: from next January, they ll be paying an average of 8 per cent more for their journeys, even though Britain s rail fares are already among the highest in Europe. On some lines, the increase will be 13 per cent. For someone who commutes from Swindon to London Paddington, for example, a distance of 50 miles, that would mean the cost of an annual season ticket rising from just over £7,000 this year to £7,586 in 2012. Passengers from Reading, some 30 miles outside London, face a near-£300 a year rise, to £3,871. It gets worse. Under a new formula for calculating fares on regulated routes (including season tickets and off-peak saver fares) which make up half all tickets sold, prices will rise at the rate of inflation plus three percentage points not just in 2012, but for the next three years. Rail commuters thus face increases of as much as 30 per cent by 2014. These are the largest fare hikes since Britain s rail network was privatised in 1995 and will price some commuters off trains altogether, say consumer groups, which calculate fares are rising four times faster than wages. Protesters, including environmental campaigners, were out in force early yesterday at Waterloo station, one of the capital s busiest hubs, warning weary commuters just what lies ahead and demanding that the rail network be brought back under state control. There s even a Bring Back British Rail lobby group. Cash raised by the higher fares will go to the government to fund much-needed improvements to the rail system, extra carriages and more electrification. It will also fund new routes to link the north and south of the capital, Thameslink, and the Crossrail project which will link east and west London. The cost of the modernisation programme has largely been borne by the public purse but, as part of its austerity drive, the government is determined to reduce the burden to the taxpayer, currently running at almost £5 billion a year. The inflation figure used by the government in its annual rail fare formula is the July retail price index (RPI), which the Office for National Statistics announced yesterday as 5 per cent. But the soaring cost of living is only partly responsible for the punitive rises. Last year, the government changed the formula on regulated fares from RPI +1 (percentage point), which had been in force since 2004, to RPI +3, hence the average rise of 8 per cent. Within that, rail operators have the flexibility to raise prices on some routes by a further five percentage points, taking the increase to 13 per cent, as long as their overall rise is within target. Meanwhile, consumer price inflation (CPI), the government s target measure, climbed back up to 4.4 per cent last month, from 4.2 per cent, and is rapidly heading towards 5 per cent, bringing further misery to savers and cash-strapped households whether or not they use rail. Fuelling the increase, which was larger than City economists had expected, was January s VAT rise, together with higher bank charges, increases in commodity, clothing and footwear prices, and rises in rental costs, particularly social housing. The traditional July sales season brought little relief this year, as struggling retailers had already brought forward their sales to June. CPI remains more than double the government s 2 per cent target and will almost certainly hit 5 per cent once the recent double-digit gas and electricity price rises take effect. Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King was once again forced to write to the chancellor explaining the overshoot, as he is required to do in every quarter that the figure remains one percentage point or more adrift of target. The correspondence file between the bank and the treasury is expanding rapidly. This was the governor s seventh consecutive letter and his 12th in total. In his letter, King said he expects inflation to fall back in 2012, although he cautioned that the precise timing and extent of the drop was highly uncertain. He warned also that the big risks currently facing the UK economy come from the rest of the world. He reiterated his long-held view that the cost of living is being driven by temporary measures, such as the increase in the standard VAT rate to 20 per cent, together with past increases in global energy and import prices. Without these, he maintained, inflation would already be below the government s 2 per cent target. For those commuters contemplating another miserable and expensive journey home last night, however, the governor s words will not have brought much comfort.

The Irish Times,Aug-17,2020,17-Aug-20,Kicking pension can down the road will cost us all; Pandemic must not be allowed to stop urgently needed pension reform,"During this pandemic the Government must not ignore the urgent need for pension reform  After protracted negotiations to form a new Government, urgent attention is now required to reform the pension system and protect the retirement security of future pensioners.  The underlying issues are clear: our population continues to age; the cost of providing State pension support is growing; and the participation rates and adequacy of private pension saving remain too low.  Experience shows that longer-term issues such as these are difficult for politicians to address while working in five-year electoral cycles. As it stands, the programme for government is vague in its commitments to pension reform.  The last government set an ambitious target of 2022 to deliver a new private pension saving system based on automatic enrolment - a key tool in addressing coverage and adequacy issues.  While the programme reaffirmed a commitment to autoenrolment, the 2022 target is now highly unlikely to materialise and a new target has yet to be set. Equally importantly, the new programme for government reaffirms the coalition's commitment to the State pension, the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  This will provide reassurance and greater certainty for responsible savers planning their retirement.  However, as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recently warned, some fundamental questions remain about the sustainability of the State pension, particularly in light of the new Government's decision to defer planned increases to the State pension age.  As the council noted, the share of the population aged over 65 is forecast to increase from 14 per cent in 2020 to 27 per cent by 2050.  Clearly, our changing demographics are accelerating the problem. Without reform and cross-party support, the rising cost of the State pension, combined with our ageing population, will impose a significant financial burden on future generations and potentially cause a reduction in the living standards and financial well-being of today's workers when they come to retire.  Shorter-term issues The programme for government also ignores three important shorter-term issues. Firstly, a commitment to preserving the current system of tax-relief incentives is critical to encourage further private retirement saving.  A report released by the Central Statistics Office last year revealed that about 40 per cent of private-sector workers in Ireland still do not have any kind of private pension savings, with many citing affordability as a specific reason.  Recent Covid-19-driven market volatility has already resulted in some loss of confidence among private pension savers; any reductions to tax-relief incentives or more draconian measures such as pension levies could cause further significant damage.  Secondly, the Government must take steps to simplify and harmonise the retirement benefits products available to individual savers.  Presently there is a bewildering range of pension saving vehicles, including personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs), personal retirement bonds and retirement annuity contracts, among others.  These should all be replaced with a single, portable pension plan and made available to any individual for whom a company pension is not an option, whether in conjunction with an autoenrolment system or not.  The complexity surrounding retirement benefit options also needs reform, particularly to allow more flexibility around when and how savers can access their benefits.  The recently-flagged proposal by the Department of Finance to rethink approved retirement funds and PRSAs is certainly a step in the right direction, potentially providing additional value and simplicity for savers.  Finally, there is an opportunity to take much-needed steps to reform company pension schemes.  The introduction of the extensive new measures set out under the European Union's Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive is long overdue.  The directive aims to facilitate better outcomes for members of employer-sponsored pension schemes by mandating more robust governance and risk management of schemes.  Other than Portugal, Ireland is the only member state yet to implement the directive and is therefore exposed to potential financial sanctions from the European Commission.  It was suggested last week that this legislation will materialise this year, which would be very much welcomed.  Better governance should result in better outcomes for retirement savers. Many employers will want to retain a pension plan as part of their range of employee benefits.  However, some employers may not have the capacity to manage the additional compliance requirements that will be imposed by this new legislation.  Pension plans As such, it is anticipated that this legislation will result in the consolidation of many pension plans, particularly smaller ones, into multi-employer master trusts, following the example of places like Australia and the UK.  The master trust structure enables multiple employers to participate in a single trust, pooling governance and investment arrangements for economies of scale and streamlining of regulatory oversight.  Employers can continue to provide the same benefits and a high-quality range of investment choices for their employees, but within the structure of a professionally-run master trust to which all governance and compliance requirements are outsourced.  Transitioning to a master trust, however, remains a complex process.  Currently, employers seeking to access the full benefits of a master trust model must formally wind up their pension scheme, resulting in unnecessary additional cost and upheaval. While some preliminary work had begun under the previous government to address some of these issues, there is an opportunity for the Government to take further steps to smooth the path for those employers who may wish to go down this route.  More reform to the current legislative framework would better facilitate these transitions. Clearly, the challenges of Covid-19 will rightly preoccupy the Government in the coming months.  However, kicking the can further down the road, as previous governments have done, on key measures to address retirement savings issues in Ireland would be a mistake that would expose our future society and retirees - and the working population who will fund them - to a very uncertain and costly future.

The Irish Times,Aug-18,2016,18-Aug-16,Depfa Bank assets rise 6% despite wind-down," Depfa Bank, the Dublin-based lender rescued by German authorities during the financial crisis, saw its assets increase by 6 per cent in the first half of this year - even though it was put into wind-down in 2014.  The lender's assets rose to EUR 39.1 billion during the period. However, this was mainly attributed to foreign-exchange and interest-rate changes during the six months, Depfa said in its interim report, published this week. It did not undertake any new business. While the bank said it expected its assets, which contracted by 25 per cent during 2015, to continue to over the remainder of the year, this will be influenced by market factors, including the impact of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. While Depfa, which has 128 permanent employees in Dublin, sees little direct impact of Brexit on its business, it said the longer-term ""related impacts on asset prices and global economic conditions remain uncertain and could have an adverse impact"" on the group.  Depfa, a provider of public-sector finance, was bought by Munich-based property lender Hypo Real Estate (HRE) for EUR 5.7 billion in 2007. However, a little over a year later HRE was force to turn to the German government for help after the collapse of Lehman Brothers when Depfa was unable to fund itself in the market. HRE, which required a EUR 10 billion capital injection from Berlin during the financial crisis, agreed under an EU state-aid restructuring plan to sell Depfa by the end of 2014. While a preferred bidder - a joint offer from US investment firm Leucadia National and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance - was picked, the German government abandoned a sale two years ago saying it would get more money by running it down itself. Depfa was subsequently transferred to a German bad bank, FMS Wertmanagement (FMS-WM) at the end of 2014. The Dublin-based bank reported a pretax loss of EUR 54 million during the first six months of the year, down from a EUR 61 million shortfall for the same period in 2015. FMS-WM has sought to accelerate the wind-up of the bank this year, with Depfa having bought back EUR 5.6 billion of its bonds in the market up until the end of July. ",1
The Irish Times,Aug-19,2013,19-Aug-13,Weighing up the cost and benefits of state-funded research,"Earlier this month, economist Martin Wolf wrote an article in this newspaper titled ""Much-maligned state takes the boldest risks in innovation"". His piece reviewed a book by Mariana Mazzucato, a Sussex university professor of economics who specialises in science and technology. It noted that governments (eg in the US and UK) have funded, through their science agencies, major research breakthroughs using taxpayer funds, including the discovery of monoclonal antibodies by the UK Medical Research Council; the US National Science Foundation's funding of what became the Google search engine; and all the technologies that make Apple's smartphone ""smart"" - the internet, wireless technologies, GPS, microelectronics, touch-screen displays, and even the SIRI personal assistant.  Wolf argued that far from a symbiotic ecosystem of evolution between the state, academia and industry, rather a parasitic one has evolved in which the costs of failed research are borne by taxpayers whilst successful research is profitably exploited by the private sector.  The state's role in research has become important because of the risks and uncertain timescales of fundamental, science-based innovation. If taxpayers fail to appreciate the economic impact of publicly-funded research, then political support for science may wither. His piece concludes that a failure to acknowledge the role of state funding of science may lead to diminished funding, and consequently damage future economic prosperity. There is credence in Wolf's review. However - while I have not read Mazzucato's thesis - the elephant in the room so deftly ignored by Wolf is the public funding of science for national security. Most, if not all, of the component technologies listed above by Wolf which make Apple's smartphone ""smart"" have in fact their primary application directly in the defence of the United States. Private sector exploitation of publicly-funded science is frequently a useful consequence - ""useful"" in that governments seek to procure packaged products for national defence rather than just raw technology, and the engineering of scientific research results into operational products is most economically driven by competitive industry. Concurrently with Wolf's effusive review of Mazzucato's book, the Times Higher Education (THE) published their World Academic Summit Innovation Index. Based on their 2012-13 World University Rankings of 400 universities in 30 countries, THE divided the research income from industry for each university by the number of employed researchers. They thus derived the industry sponsorship per researcher. South Korea's six universities (in the global top 400) show an average of EUR 74,000 income per researcher. Ireland's five universities (in the 400) collectively come last out of the 30 countries involved, with an average of just EUR 6,000 per researcher. There are some obvious shortcuts in THE's analysis. Only a subset of each nation's universities are considered (just those making the global 400). Both consultancy income from business, and royalties and/or equity from commercial licensing are ignored. Nevertheless the analysis led to much critical comment, and perhaps some consternation not just here in Ireland but also elsewhere. On the other hand, although Ireland may have been last in the ranking of 30 nations for commercial funding per researcher, clearly Ireland is nevertheless doing something right: it is one of the world leaders for foreign direct investment.  Clearly Ireland's academic system is helping attract and retain global multinationals in Ireland. Thus, the real story for Ireland from the Innovation Index of THE may not be the commercial funding per researcher, but its reciprocal - the number of researchers supported for a given amount of commercial funding.  The analysis from THE then shows that it is far more cost-effective for industry to fund multiple researchers in Ireland than in many countries, and especially compared to South Korea. The fiscal efficiency of Irish researchers for multinationals - the ""roster bang for the buck"" as compared to other nations - is indicative of the relative funding of researchers by the State versus industry, on international comparisons of scientific remuneration and capital investment, and of researcher demographics.  Ireland clearly does not have the national fiscal resources of the more populous states to fund science, nor does Ireland concern itself with scientific research for national defence and security. Nevertheless, Irish taxpayers have spent a considerable sum on publicly -funded research since the creation of Science Foundation Ireland in 2003. In 2010 alone, Forf^os reported a figure for Ireland of EUR 870 million (about 0.67 per cent of GNP). One direct benefit for Irish taxpayers has indeed been the continued momentum in foreign direct investment, in part driven by well-trained researchers. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that hitherto there have yet to emerge world-leading Irish brand names based on Irish-funded scientific discovery.  Concurrently with the Wolf article and the analysis from THE, in the last fortnight two major private sector innovations received global publicity. In the United Kingdom, Reaction Engine's Skylon project is building a 27,000 km/hr highly reusable spaceplane. In the United States, Elon Musk (who founded PayPal, Tesla cars and SpaceX private space vehicles) announced details of his 1,300 km/hr Hyperloop train.

The Irish Times,Aug-02,2008,02-Aug-08,Social partnership must be made to work,"ANALYSIS:Crucial to our boom time, the partnership mechanism is needed now more than ever, writes Arthur Beesley  A STEADY succession of social partnership pay deals was achieved with relative ease in the boom years. Now that the economic tide has turned with a vengeance, the system is showing marked signs of wear and tear. Whether it breaks down definitively this weekend remains to be seen. But with little prospect of agreement in sight late yesterday, any suspension of the current talks would mean that the system has failed its biggest test since the torrid days of the late 1980s. The irony here is that social partnership - a mechanism to foster industrial peace and set fiscal parameters for the Government, business and workers - was a crucial pillar of Ireland's economic recovery and the extraordinary boom that followed it. As the threat of recession looms ever larger, it seems now that a crucial lever for tackling the complex challenges that lie ahead has come badly unstuck. While conditions worsen by the week and forecasts point to a worsening of the pain in the months ahead, fixing it will not be easy. Yet this is in the best long-term interest of all participants, notwithstanding the immediate pressures on each side. In uncertain times, a new partnership deal would offer a level of certainty over the cost of running businesses and the State itself, and a lower risk of strikes and other industrial disruption. For those charged with attracting foreign direct investment into the State to create jobs, it would show companies from abroad that there can be some control over costs in an economy more exposed to the vicissitudes of the international markets. If no agreement is reached, all of that simply fades away. This is bad news indeed for Taoiseach Brian Cowen, whose predecessor Bertie Ahern was master of the partnership process and never failed to bring home the deal. But Ahern, the great conciliator, led in happier economic times. If prosperity meant there was something for everyone from social partnership in Ahern's time and an atmosphere of co-operation, Cowen's arrival at the helm of Government has coincided with an increasingly ideological slant to the argument from employers and unions. Hence shrill demands for a cut in the minimum wage from the Small Firms Association. These seem every bit as unreasonable as arguments from some trade unionists that seem to cast pay in the private sector at large in the cloak of the handsome remuneration seen at top management. Cowen is already in the thick of an exchequer crunch that has eroded tax revenue while expenditure increases to meet the cost of rising unemployment, so the last thing he needs now is an increased threat of industrial disruption. Yet that will be in store if no agreement is reached and employers and unions return to local bargaining. With this in mind, it must be the Taoiseach's calculation that no deal is possible at present if he does not intervene to bring reluctant partners together in their mutual interest. The biggest issue here is pay and a painful inflation rate that cuts into the standard of living, hurting most those with the least. This has led to demands for a 5 per cent rise from unions, which has been met with employer pleadings of ruinous consequences. There are severe pressures indeed on both sides. Mortgage rates have risen, just as motor fuel, home heating oil, gas and electricity tariffs rise to levels that make it difficult for many families to make ends meet. As house valuations plummet, consumer confidence is on the floor. All of this serves to increase pressure on business, as dollar and sterling weakness erode revenues from abroad, and higher energy and finance costs eat into the bottom line. Thus liquidations and receiverships are on the increase, leading inexorably to redundancies and higher unemployment. As Cowen and his Ministers attempt to balance the books in these most difficult of circumstances, this cocktail of external and internal forces is greatly increasing pressure on the public finances. Hence the recent round of spending cutbacks and glaring threat of more to come. If social partnership was designed to grease the cogs of the economy, the defining hour is rapidly approaching.",0
The Irish Times,Aug-20,2010,20-Aug-10,Bank's exit could affect viability of 150 hotels,"UP TO 150 hotels are facing an uncertain future as Bank of Scotland (Ireland) yesterday announced it is to cease providing working capital to business customers by the end of the year due to the bank s withdrawal from the Irish market. It is estimated that the bank provides upwards of EUR 30 million in working capital facilities to the hotel sector. It is responsible for 20 per cent of all loans to the sector equating to more than EUR 2 billion in long-term loans. While hotels, along with retail and business customers, will be obliged to repay their loans to the bank as normal, there is concern that the decision to withdraw working capital facilities will have a serious impact on the industry. According to the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), the hotel sector is particularly dependent on working capital due to the seasonal nature of the industry. The IHF s Paul Gallagher warned that the withdrawal of working capital facilities in December would be catastrophic . He also highlighted the fact that other banks will be reluctant to take on new customers, particularly when asset securities will continue to be held by Bank of Scotland (Ireland). Business representative groups from across the board expressed concern about the impact of the closure on Irish businesses. It is estimated that up to 20 per cent of the bank s 175,000 customers are business customers. While there is no specific breakdown of Bank of Scotland s market share in terms of business accounts, research by Isme estimates that the bank has a 5 per cent share of SME customers. Isme s Mark Fielding said the closure would lead to a further deterioration in competition for SME lending. Both Isme and Chambers Ireland expressed concern about the ability of SME customers to secure credit from other financial institutions. There was a mood of muted resignation among Bank of Scotland (Ireland) employees yesterday as they left their workplace on St Stephen s Green. One 25-year-old said there had been a breakdown of trust between bank and employees as workers had been assured in February that there jobs were safe.  It s hard to believe them [now] when they say that our jobs are safe for two years.  Some workers complained that they had first heard the news through the media. The 36 workers who lost their jobs immediately were told of the job cuts by management yesterday morning, while the remaining 800 staff were told of the news via a conference call. Opposition politicians yesterday claimed that the bank s exit from Ireland was an indictment of the Government s economic and banking policy. Labour Party finance spokeswoman Joan Burton said other foreign retail banks operating in Ireland were anxious to curtail their activity here, despite assurances from the Government that the banking situation is under control. Fine Gael deputy spokesman on finance Kieran O Donnell called on the Minister for Finance and the Financial Regulator to make a full statement about when they learned of the bank s intentions. Asked about the withdrawal of the bank from the Irish market, Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan said that there had been too much lending in the Irish economy, and the cost for any foreign bank pulling out would be met by the shareholders of that bank.",1
The Irish Times,Aug-20,2011,20-Aug-11,Cantillon,"Inside the world of business Eurobonds just will not go away EUROBONDS SIMPLY won t go away. German chancellor Angela Merkel restated her opposition forcefully yesterday, telling a political rally of her Christian Democrat party that euro bonds would not allow any rights at all to intervene to force discipline on others . For his part, French president Nicolas Sarkozy, writing in Le Figaro repeated his argument that introducing eurobonds in any form without further fiscal union could threaten his country s prized AAA-rating. But there is clearly no consensus. Belgium s finance minister Didier Reynders was reported yesterday in the Financial Times as saying the common currency area should issue common euro-denominated bonds . For all Merkel and Sarkozy s common purpose, the response of the markets indicate they are more of the Belgian s view. Having recovered from an uncertain start, markets were thrown again into confusion when Merkel s comments were reported towards the end of the day. Elsewhere, comments by European economic and monetary affairs commissioner Olli Rehn in a written reply to a question in the European Parliament that EU regulators may push for joint bond sales by euro-area nations to help contain the debt crisis were reported, without the detail that Rehn s reply was made last Monday, a day before the Merkel/Sarkozy summit. Merkel s spokesman last night denied her latest remarks were directed at Rehn.  The chancellor wasnt replying to Rehn but giving the reason once again for our rejection of eurobonds, said Steffen Seibert. Regardless of what Olli Rehn is working on, without Germany, France and many others, it will amount to nothing.  The problem is that markets are unsure just what the various parties can actually agree and whether it will be robust enough to do the trick. HP luring investors into cloud computing HEWLETT-PACKARD, the once-venerable engineering powerhouse of Silicon Valley, seems to have developed an unfortunate habit of shooting itself in the foot. Since the departure of highly regarded chief executive Mark Hurd 12 months ago, the company has looked rudderless and without leadership. In March, chief executive Leo Apotheker held a media day on the company s new strategy which raised more questions than it answered. The following month, a memo from Apotheker to senior staff warning of a tough third-quarter was leaked to the press causing the company to bring forward its announcement of the results. Yesterday, after news broke of HP s $10.3 billion purchase of British software firm Autonomy, it also announced its intention to spin off its PC unit, drop plans to put the Web OS it acquired though the purchase of Palm on a range of mobile devices, and is dropping its iPad competitor, the TouchPad. Even amid the global market meltdown, the investor reaction has been stunning. Yesterday morning in New York, its stock was down by 23 per cent at one point, its biggest intraday decline since 1980. The irony is that the strategy announced by HP makes a lot of sense in the medium term even if it is likely to mean short-term pain. It is following the lead of IBM by spinning off its PC business allowing it to concentrate on products and services for business customers. It was a commodity business that never sat comfortably at HP whose founders prided themselves on engineering innovation. HP also looked like being an also-ran in the tablet market where the iPad dominates but models using Google s software are rapidly grabbing market share. Apotheker will now focus on the head-to-head battle with IBM and Oracle in the much more lucrative cloud computing space. Convincing investors to come on that journey is just the first of many hurdles he faces. NEXT WEEK The European Central Bank will release details of bond purchases in the week after the Merkel Sarkozy summit",1
The Irish Times,Aug-20,2020,20-Aug-20,Mali mutineers vow elections after takeover; Soldiers say they plan transitional government after president Keita ousted,"The soldiers who ousted Malian president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita have said they plan to set up a transitional government and hold elections in the west African country that is a key western ally in the fight against jihadism in the Sahel.  Mr Keita, widely known as IBK, had been the target of weeks of mass street protests against what critics say has been seven years of corrupt and inept rule, before a group of soldiers detained him and other senior government and military officials on Tuesday. ""If elements of the army felt compelled to intervene to bring an end to this - do I really have a choice?"" Mr Keita said in a nationally televised address announcing the dissolution of parliament and his government hours after mutineering soldiers arrested him at gunpoint. ""I don't want a single drop of blood to be shed to keep me in power."" In the wake of Mr Keita's resignation, soldiers clad in military fatigues and calling themselves the National Committee for the Salvation of the People addressed the country.  ""We are not holding on to power, but we are holding on to the stability of the country,"" said Ismael Wague, the deputy chief of staff of the air force. ""This will allow us to organise within an agreed reasonable timeframe, general elections to equip Mali with strong institutions, which are able to better manage our everyday lives and restore confidence between the government and the governed."" Condemnation  The African Union condemned the soldiers' actions, as did western allies France, US and the UN. The UN Security Council said it would hold an emergency meeting yesterday. West African regional bloc Ecowas announced sanctions that include suspending trade and closing borders to Mali.  On Tuesday, before Mr Keita's resignation, Mali's main opposition group M5-RPF suggested to Reuters that it supported the mutiny, which spurred hundreds of people to gather in central Bamako to celebrate. It remains unclear what role Mahmoud Dicko, the Salafist imam who leads the M5-RPF coalition - which has organised weeks of mass protests calling for Mr Keita's resignation - will play in any transition.  Tuesday's mutiny echoed a 2012 coup that also began at Kati military base outside Bamako and ended with the resignation of then president Amadou Toumani Touré. François Conradie, senior political economist at NKC African Economics, pointed out that it took 16 months before Mr Keita was elected following that coup, during which time jihadis captured northern Mali, prompting a French intervention that continues today with 5,000 troops on the ground in the region. ""In the short term, there is no reason to expect an improvement in the security situation - to the contrary, the jihadist networks in the north of the country will see a gap to extend their influence while the situation in Bamako is uncertain and the French do not have a civilian interlocutor,"" he said in a research note. One driving factor in public frustration with Mr Keita's government has been its failure to contain spiralling violence in central and northern Mali that has spread across the region, killing thousands and displacing millions.  France, the former colonial power, has been leading the effort to beat back a diffuse network of extremist groups that have joined forces with various ethnic militias to slaughter soldiers and civilians alike.  The military junta ""was quick to express readiness to work with France, so I don't think France's efforts are jeopardised but it will be a challenge"", wrote Arthur Boutellis, senior adviser at the International Peace Institute. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020",0

The Irish Times,Aug-22,2014,22-Aug-14,Rabobank reports drop in profits,"Rabobank has warned that the impact of Russian sanctions may hurt its business, as the Dutch mutual bank reported a drop in profits the first half of the year. Rabobank forecast a recovery in the second half of this year as private consumption picks up faster than expected, but cautioned in a statement yesterday that Russian sanctions could have an adverse impact on its business customers. ""The consequences of the trade conflict with Russia that has recently flared up represent an uncertain factor,"" the bank said, adding that sanctions could have a ""limited"" impact on its performance, in a further sign that the continuing stand-off over Ukraine is creating uncertainty for businesses across Europe. Fears of a damaging trade war between Russia and the West have grown as Moscow banned imports of a wide range of European Union and United States agricultural and food products this month and threatened possible sanctions on aerospace, shipbuilding and auto sectors. It has also banned a collection of other western food and drink products, through Rospotrebnadzor, its consumer protection agency, which on Wednesday temporarily shut down four McDonald's restaurants, including the group's flagship Moscow location. Climate of trust  ""We are assuming that the current trade conflict will not continue to escalate and that the climate of trust will not be further eroded,"" Rabobank's statement said. ""Should this happen, nonetheless, a weaker development of the economy in 2014 and 2015 cannot be excluded."" In the six months to June 30th the bank reported that net profit slipped by 3 per cent to EUR 1.1 billion, pulled down by a one-off EUR 214 million charge from the Dutch government related to the bailout of local lender SNS Reaal. As the Netherlands economy gradually recovered on the back of trade and corporate investments, Rabobank added that domestic consumer confidence was picking up as the housing market rapidly recovered. Its loan portfolio decreased by EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 433.2 billion in the period, a drop the bank said was partly explained by early repayments on residential mortgages. Solvency, measured by the common equity tier 1 ratio, dropped to 12.6 per cent in the first half of the year. The bank issued little further guidance about the potential impact of the asset quality review by the European Central Bank, the results of which are expected in October this year. Investigation  The   lender has been at the centre of an ongoing investigation into the manipulation of Libor and other key benchmark rates, paying some $1 billion to US, UK and Dutch authorities to settle the investigation in October. On Monday a former senior rate trader at Rabobank pleaded guilty of conspiring to manipulate interest rates to a court in New York. A Japanese trader who also worked for Rabobank was the first person to plead guilty in the investigation earlier this year. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2014",1
The Irish Times,Aug-22,2020,22-Aug-20,"Pandemic season shows while intercounty scene is wonderful, the club is where it's at; The broad agreement on the split-season proposal is a huge shift in attitude and vision from within the GAA","In the early days of Ireland's lockdown, when being told to stay home felt like a novelty and was accompanied by an unexpected burst of Mediterranean weather, the Cork writer and satirist Colm Tobin noted on Twitter: ""I have to say, I didn't expect the apocalypse to involve quite so much DIY."" The pandemic has forced all sorts of questions about how everyone works and lives. The GAA, perhaps the last pillar still standing, has arguably undergone the biggest change of all. For as Ireland's sports fans anxiously await the uncertain beginning of the 2020 All-Ireland championships, the pandemic has brought to a head one of the oldest fundamental questions: what is the GAA for? It already seems like a lifetime ago since GAA pundit Joe Brolly was unceremoniously axed as RTÉ's agent provocateur, a role in which he had flourished for almost two decades. Irreverence was the Derry man's calling card. He was unpredictable and occasionally over the top and he continuously used his soap box to cry foul when he believed the GAA to be going down a dangerous road - which was often.  He bemoaned what he perceived to be the joylessness of playing intercounty football. He carried the flag for the cause of the club players, who have played second fiddle to the intercounty All-Irelands. He was death on the increasingly corporate profile of the GAA. When Sky television entered the game and began to bid for the rights to broadcast the All-Ireland championship, he initiated a passionate and persuasive argument about why the GAA was wrong; why they were selling out.  Distinct danger  Inevitably, he got it in the neck in January when he signed up to work as a pundit for Eir, another commercial sports package broadcaster. ""Increasingly I was feeling I was howling into the wilderness,"" Brolly said then of his decision. ""It's clear there is going to be a whole new landscape and it is happening so quickly."" His words were prescient, if not for the right reasons. Brolly made his debut on a freezing night in Ballybofey, wrapped up in a parka and looking to all the world like one of Shackleton's travelling party. Not long after that, sport stopped.  Had you told Brolly and his colleagues on that evening that before the year was out the All-Ireland football final would be fixed for Saturday, December 19th; that there was a distinct danger that neither the football nor hurling championship would be played at all; and that there was broad agreement that a year should be split cleanly between club and championship, with the intercounty season running from January to July, they couldn't have comprehended it.  Striking a balance between the scale of the club season and the profile and demands of the intercounty league and All-Ireland championship has been a task that has vexed the best and brightest within the GAA for years. But the sudden suspension of Gaelic games gave an unexpected and unwanted answer to a question that had been muttered through the generations. Everyone gives out about the GAA but what would life be like without it? Duller, turned out to be the answer.  Club gates were locked and bolted. Morale-boosting skills sessions and challenges did the rounds on social media but that novelty soon wore out. A deluge of old games was broadcast on television but couldn't compensate for the real live thing. The absence ran deep. The GAA responded by swiftly redrafting an emergency schedule, with the club championships first up and the summer All-Irelands now re-fixed for the depths of winter. That response has given an unexpected boost to the club game. For once, it has the big stage to itself in the height of summer. It is literally the only show in town. There has never been a bigger appetite for club championship games among a national audience starved of live competition. Attendance has obviously been limited by Covid restrictions but television and streaming figures have been hugely encouraging.  The club is acknowledged as the bedrock of the GAA and its social values have been harnessed by slick advertising campaigns lauding the virtues of perseverance and togetherness and triumph over hardship. The pandemic season seems to have strengthened the idea that while the intercounty championship is wonderful, it is a luxury: that the club is where it is at. The mood was caught by Ken Hogan, the former All-Ireland-winning Tipperary goalkeeper, who this week told RTÉ's Damian Lawlor that the idea of a split season was ""a no-brainer"". Fulcrum  ""This has been a breath of fresh air, the club season. Every parish in Ireland is alive and vibrant. I was over in my own club in Lorrha and to see Bonner [Maher, the Tipperary hurler] and the lads there all involved in the training . . . the fulcrum of the whole association is the GAA pitch."" The proposal for a clean calendar split between club and county was originally mooted by the Club Players Association. Now, it has been enthusiastically endorsed by the Gaelic Players Association, the body representing intercounty players and by the GAA.  At Wednesday evening's national fixtures task force meeting, all parties re-affirmed their broad commitment to the introduction of a split season. GAA president John Horan has already stated his belief that it would be ""too risky"" to try to introduce such a sweeping, new structure before the 2022 season. Nonetheless, there are likely to be growing calls to push ahead with the reform in time for next season. It's a huge shift in attitude and vision from within the GAA. Just last month, in early July, CPA chairman Micheál Briody told RTÉ's Joanne Cantwell that his organisation had asked for clarification about the club/county fixtures issue but had yet to receive it.  He sounded faintly resigned then as he warned that returning to the old model of organising games could not work as ""the dropout rate is way too big across the association. ""2020 will be the catalyst for change overall,"" he predicted. ""Because the club season is coming before the intercounty, it is highlighting the issue. It is highlighting the lack of governance."" It is as though everyone has fallen into line with that viewpoint over the subsequent five weeks. And it brings about its own questions. There was considerable unease when the GAA revised its All-Ireland schedule to effectively finish the championships by the end of August. It meant that the GAA was voluntarily ceding what had been its sacred and prestige month: September. From a cold commercial point of view, that seemed like a huge risk. Why would an organisation competing for public and media attention readily cede the stage to opposition - and professional - sporting organisations behind soccer and rugby?  Unbroken coverage  Back when the intercounty league season was split either side of Christmas, the GAA's prestige competition was always in the mind's eye and in the headlines. Even when the leagues were compressed to begin in late January, the intercounty games enjoyed eight to nine months of unbroken coverage and profile and attendance. But the proposed split further shrinks the national profile of the GAA's premier competition. Leaving a full six-month gap without any intercounty games is a brave call. It means compressing the elite intercounty season, which commands a strong national interest, to give a fair platform to the club games, which enjoys an intense but localised audience. The split-season initiative may inadvertently also serve to dilute the sense that the intercounty scene was steaming unavoidably towards some sort of concession towards professionalism. A shorter and cleanly defined intercounty season will give both managers and players a clearer framework in which to work - and to then do other things with their lives, including giving a full and uncompromised commitment to the club. Because the other inadvertent effect of the pandemic has been to clarify what the GAA means to people. The appeal isn't really about the promise of winning one of the two big All-Ireland trophies. If it was, its influence would have disappeared decades ago as only the same few counties turn up year after year.  Collective wellbeing  There's a strong argument to be made that the old intercounty and provincial model has become so unfair that it is almost broken. Still, the public loves it. This week's revised Government protocols on the playing of sport suddenly left the idea of winter All-Ireland championships even more fragile. Within the GAA, there is an increasing feeling that playing the games, irrespective of limited or non-existent crowds, has become vital; that it is, as former president Nickey Brennan put it, important ""for the health and wellbeing of the country, who look forward to seeing the matches"".  That sense of responsibility for the collective wellbeing of its members - and casual supporters - may have contributed to the hastily worded response by the GAA to the Government advice this week. The invitation to Dr Ronan Glynn, acting chief medical officer, to come in and present the ""empirical evidence"" behind the decision did not translate well. But it also reflected the frustration, given that the organisation has been proactive and conscientious in its response to playing games through the pandemic.  The coming weeks will see the GAA come into a sharper focus, with county finals pitting big local rivalries and stars against one another. Once they are completed, the return date for the intercounty scene will loom large. Economic and social challenges are so manifold and grave at the moment that it will be impossible for the championship to hold the same grip on the imagination as it did during normal years of relative sanguinity and prosperity. That may not be a bad thing. Simply completing the championship and providing a welcome distraction for people is enough.  For there was some truth in the thread of worry that ran through Joe Brolly's various outbursts and polemics: that the whole scene had slightly lost the run of itself; that the old comparison to professionalism had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Whereas in truth, the All-Ireland championships are much lighter and far more important than that.",0
The Irish Times,Aug-23,2008,23-Aug-08,Retail sales fell 5.2% in the year to June,"THE VOLUME of retail sales fell by 5.2 per cent in the year to June, the biggest annual decline since January 1987, provisional data released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office showed. The figures, which reflects the current weakness in consumer spending, were largely driven by a 14.2 per cent annual drop in motor trades, which includes petrol and forecourt sales, and a weak 0.5 per cent increase in the non-specialised stores sector, which accounts for supermarket sales. There was also an 18.6 per cent annual fall in furniture and lighting sales, a 10.6 per cent decline in sales of electrical goods and a 10.3 per cent drop in the sector covering books, newspapers and stationery sales. The data shows that for the three-month period between March and May of this year retail sales fell in all sectors of the economy when compared with the previous quarter. However, although the June figure represents the fifth consecutive monthly drop, the rate of decline appears to have eased somewhat when compared with the steep changes recorded in the first four months of 2008. The CSO figures show that if motor trades are excluded there was an annual decrease of 1.8 per cent and the monthly change was -1.9 per cent. Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers, said a number of factors were contributing to the weak trend in consumer spending this year. ""Disposable income growth has been eroded by high consumer price inflation and the emergence of weakness in the labour market, mainly emanating from declining construction employment, but also reflecting a more generalised weakness in labour demand,"" he said. Mr McQuaid said the figures suggested the economy would, in the second quarter, post negative growth even greater than the figure of 1.5 per cent recorded in the opening quarter. ""The bottom line is that the Irish economic picture continues to deteriorate, and with consumers clearly retrenching we strongly believe that the Government should be looking at providing fiscal stimulus (tax cuts) in the December Budget to alleviate the pain on the hard-pressed personal sector,"" he said. Chief economist with National Irish Bank Dr Ronnie O'Toole said: ""What is clear from the figures is that the consumer strike that began in April has continued."" However, he said there may be some relief for the rest of the year, as purchasing power is boosted by a subdued price environment. Employers' group Ibec said sectors related to housing continue to be badly hit, with large annual declines recorded in the sales of electrical goods and furniture and lighting. Ibec economist Reetta Suonperä said: ""Given the uncertain economic climate, people are naturally becoming more cautious, postponing any discretionary large-scale purchases."" Ulster Bank economist Lynsey Clemenger said the figures added to an already dismal week for Irish economic data, when seen in combination of a marked deterioration in the labour market and weak external trade figures. Ms Clemenger said: ""Against the backdrop of a deteriorating labour market and a weakening general economy, in addition to the numerous drains on household incomes, we are likely to observe weakness in retail sales, and consumer spending in general, for some time to come.""",1
The Irish Times,Aug-24,2018,24-Aug-18,Smurfit Kappa fights back as Venezuela takes temporary control of subsidiary," Smurfit Kappa has defended itself after the Venezuelan government took temporary control of the Irish cardboard boxmaker's subsidiary in the South American country, which is in economic freefall and recording hyperinflation.  Local reports have said that the government seized Smurfit Kappa Carton de Venezuela for three months, amid complaints about prices that the company is charging for packaging products in an alleged abuse of its dominant market position. Meanwhile, sources close to Smurfit Kappa said on Thursday that there is no basis to claims from union officials, contained in a Reuters report, that the company gave employees paid holidays in July rather than keep them at work. Salaries in Venezuela are so low and inflation is running at such a level that workers in the country are widely relying on factory canteens to get enough to eat.  ""Following two days of inspections by the Venezuelan government at the group's subsidiary, Smurfit Kappa Carton de Venezuela (SKCV), a number of allegations have been made against SKCV. The group entirely refutes these allegations and believes them to be without merit,"" Smurfit Kappa said in a statement on Thursday.  Ethical standards  ""The group has operated in Venezuela since 1986 to the highest business and ethical standards. Smurfit Kappa will continue to monitor the situation closely.""  A spokesman for Smurfit Kappa declined to comment on the specific allegations that have been made by Venezuelan authorities.  Venezuela on Monday devalued its currency, the bolívar, by 95 per cent, in a desperate bid to curb hyperinflation in the country, which is running at an annual rate of 80,000 per cent and predicted by the International Monetary Fund to hit 1,000,000 per cent before the year is out.  With prices doubling every four weeks so far in 2018, life has become intolerable for millions of Venezuelans, with many going hungry or fleeing the country. The internet has become awash this week with images of products such as chickens, carrots and toilet paper that are dwarfed by the stacks of Venezuelan bank notes required to to buy the items.  Smurfit Kappa, which employs about 1,900 people in Venezuela, a market it entered in 1986, has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the economically-stricken country, even as local authorities have seized some of the company's assets in the past decade. However, a slew of other multinationals, including Kellogg's, General Mills and General Motors have abandoned assets in the country or sold them off cheaply.  Financial report  Smurfit Kappa, led by chief executive Tony Smurfit, said in its latest financial report, published earlier this month, that its shipments of corrugated cardboard from Venezuela slumped 18 per cent in the first six months of this year.  ""However, the group's operations continue to perform in extremely difficult circumstances and we continue to export paper to other SKG [Smurfit Kappa Group] operations in the region,"" the report said. ""The macro situation remains uncertainty."" Venezuela accounted for less than 1 per cent of the group's EUR 724 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) in the first half, down from 2 per cent for the corresponding period last year. The value of its Venezuelan assets fell to EUR 57 million in June from EUR 128 million in December.  The report added: ""The nationalisation of foreign owned companies or assets by the Venezuelan government remains a risk. Market value compensation is either negotiated or arbitrated under applicable laws or treaties in these cases. However, the amount and timing of such compensation is necessarily uncertain.""",0
The Irish Times,Aug-25,2007,25-Aug-07,In 1984 this man was a billionaire. Then he decided to give away most of his wealth. Why did he do it?,"In the first of two extracts from his new biography of Chuck Feeney, Conor O'Clery traces his journey from billionaire businessman to global philanthropist whose generosity favoured Ireland   Chuck Feeney, a blue-collar Irish-American from New Jersey, co-founded the first chain of duty-free shops in the Asia Pacific, just as the Japanese tourism boom was starting in the 1960s. By the 1980s his company, Duty Free Shoppers (DFS), had become the biggest retail chain in the world, and Feeney was listed in Forbes as one of the richest 25 Americans. Forbes was wrong, however. Feeney had by then transferred his vast fortune, irrevocably, in its totality and in secret, to his charitable foundation in Bermuda, a unique act in the history of philanthropy. Until recently his giving has also been secretive: beneficiaries were simply informed that the money was coming from a group of anonymous wealthy Americans. So far Feeney's foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, has made donations worldwide amounting to $4 billion and it will spend down the remaining $4 billion in the next decade. He has directed more than $1 billion, mainly to education, research and political reconciliation, to the island of Ireland alone over the past two decades. Time magazine said he may go down in history as the most generous American giver of all time. Noted for his frugality - he wears a plastic watch and flies economy class - Feeney, 76, has co-operated in his biography now, primarily to promote giving-while-living among the very wealthy. As he became more wealthy, Chuck Feeney began giving some of his money away in a piecemeal fashion. He was generous to colleagues and often paid for hospital treatment for staff or their kids. The earliest significant act of giving that he remembers was a donation of $10,000 that he sent in the 1960s to his friend and former professor, Robert A (Bob) Beck, who was dean of the Hotel School [ in Cornell University] from 1961 to 1981. The Hotel School had asked for $1,000, but ""I wanted to make a gift that was meaningful, and I reckoned $10,000 was meaningful,"" he said. He recalled with a laugh how Beck, who had lost a leg in Normandy, told him that he was so excited at getting such an amount that he held up the cheque to get a good look at it and a gust of wind came along ""and the next thing he was running across a field to catch up with it."" The first instance of active philanthropy was the provision of a sports centre for the Blanche de Castille Catholic school in Nice, which his children attended. He paid to have a sports complex carved into the slope of the hill, with indoor facilities and outdoor tennis courts that could also be used for basketball and handball. Thereafter he contributed to various charities, but he was not satisfied with being just a donor. He told a persistent correspondent from Pacific Business News who caught up with him in Honolulu in June 1980 that his idea of helping charities was not simply handing money over but personally seeing that it was effectively used to help as many people as possible. ""I am not really into money,"" he told the reporter. ""Some people get their kicks that way. That's not my style."" He was ""intensely competitive"", but his motivation was derived from the creative challenge of applying a better approach to something that already existed. His definition of success, he said, was not having all the money one desired, but being able to raise a happy, healthy family. ""There has to be a balance in life. A balance of business, family, and the opportunity to learn and teach."" He had already begun to tease out these themes in conversation with Harvey Dale. Feeney and the lawyer had become friends since Dale first advised Tourists International on restructuring company finances in the early 1960s. The New York attorney had established himself as the Feeney family consigliere, advising Chuck and Danielle, mostly on tax issues. An accomplished pianist with a passion for Mozart and a gift for mastering complex tax issues, Dale had become a partner in a number of New York law firms and was made professor of law at New York University in 1979. He was intense, focused, and legalistic, but had no operational background, a perfect foil for Feeney, who was restless and business oriented. Over a number of lunches and dinners in the late 1970s, as Feeney's estimated wealth approached a quarter of a billion dollars, he and Dale began talking about serious philanthropy. Fond of telling business associates that they should think big, Feeney applied the same advice to himself as he struggled with the concept of serious giving. It wasn't long before Dale realised that what was gestating in Feeney's mind was something radical, that while Feeney relished his continuing success in business, he wanted not just to be a generous donor but to shed the burden of wealth and assume responsibility for its charitable use. As their conversations progressed, Dale introduced Feeney to the literature of giving. He quoted to him the advice the Reverend Frederick Gates gave to his employer, John D Rockefeller, the world's first billionaire: ""Mr Rockefeller, your fortune is rolling up like an avalanche! You must distribute it faster than it grows! If you do not, it will crush you and your children and your children's children!"" They discussed the writings of Andrew Carnegie, the son of a Scottish immigrant to the United States, who accumulated a massive fortune providing iron and steel for American railways in the late 19th century, and who gave away much of it during his lifetime to fund the establishment of libraries, schools, and universities. Feeney reread several times Carnegie's famous essay, ""Wealth,"" first published in the North American Review in 1889. The philanthropist argued that there were three ways to dispose of surplus wealth: It could be left to the family, bequeathed to the government, or given away while alive, preferably to those who could use it well. The first was motivated by vanity and a misguided affection for the children, who were so burdened that it amounted to a curse; the second required the owner to die before the wealth was used and his wishes could then be thwarted; and the third ensured that surplus wealth was put to good use and not dispersed over hundreds of years in trifling amounts. The best way to use wealth, concluded Carnegie, was to provide ""the ladders upon which the aspiring can rise""- such as universities and libraries. Carnegie also cautioned that a man of wealth should set an example ""of modest, unostentatious living, shunning display or extravagance."" What Carnegie advocated was to have a profound effect on the New Jersey entrepreneur. ""I do remember somebody gave me a copy of a speech that Carnegie had given at Cornell, and for some reason I researched that speech and read two books on Carnegie,"" recalled Feeney. Harvey Dale, who is Jewish, also introduced Feeney to the writings of Maimonides, the 12th-century Jewish philosopher who taught that the highest of eight levels of tzedakah, or giving, was to help a fellow Jew to become self-sufficient through training and education, and that the second-highest level was giving in such a way that the donor did not know the donee, nor did the beneficiary know where the money came from. They discussed the fact that among all religions, the highest form of giving had always been that which was not motivated by ego, or by the prospect of political or social leverage, which relieved the beneficiary of any feeling of shame or indebtedness or the expense of a public ceremony to honour the donor. Jesus Christ advised givers in the Sermon on the Mount: ""When you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men."" The Qur'an stated, ""If you declare your charities, they are still good. But if you keep them anonymous and give them to the poor, it is better for you and remits more of your sins."" Dale guessed that Chuck wasn't initially motivated by anything that had to do with Carnegie or Maimonides, or indeed with any religious teaching. He felt it was inevitable, given Chuck's natural goodness and the culture he brought with him from his boyhood in New Jersey, that he would consider using his fortune to help others. ""He just became more and more interested in giving back and not owning,"" he recalled. Feeney also decided that whatever he did it would be done anonymously. There were two principal reasons for this, he reflected. He did not want to ""blow my own horn"" - just as his mother never let the neighbour with Lou Gehrig's disease know she was going out of her way to give him a lift - and he did not want to discourage other contributors from giving to the same deserving cause, which he thought would be the inevitable outcome of publicity. He had also been inundated with requests after giving sizeable donations to Cornell, and he did not want that to continue. Giving away large amounts required the setting up of a specific foundation in a carefully chosen location, especially if Feeney decided he wanted to transfer to such a foundation any of his business assets as he seemed to be indicating, and if he wanted his giving to be international in its scope. Harvey Dale set out to do a worldwide survey of jurisdictions that would accommodate Chuck's requirements. The United States was ruled out as a base. Anonymity would be almost impossible, and the US government was at that time moving to bar foundations from holding a concentration of business assets, as federal authorities had found evidence that many wealthy Americans were using philanthropies simply to perpetuate control of their corporate interests. Dale considered the Channel Islands and the Bahamas and finally settled on Bermuda. The 21 square miles of self-governing British territory in the middle of the Atlantic imposed no direct taxes on personal or corporate income, did not levy taxes on charities or foundations, and did not require public disclosure of foundations. Bermuda also allowed a philanthropy to fund good causes worldwide. It had a highly developed economy and financial structure, and Feeney's company, General Atlantic Group Ltd, was already registered in Bermuda, in a little office opposite a bakery delicatessen on Washington Mall in the capital, Hamilton. But to set up a foundation in Bermuda, a person had to be a resident for a year. And that meant not just Chuck but Danielle, as everything was in her name. In March 1978, Feeney bought a large villa in Bermuda with the help of a local banker, Cummings Zuill, a member of an old Bermuda family whom he had met when Zuill was working in Hong Kong for the Bank of Bermuda. The Feeney family moved there in the summer of 1978. ""Chuck will say that was my punishment visited on him,"" said Harvey Dale. ""Danielle will certainly say that!"" ******* THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN Chuck and Harvey, meanwhile, had evolved to the point where it became clear that he was intending to put everything into a foundation - the DFS shareholding, the businesses, and all his investments. He would make sure Danielle and the children were taken care of, and the houses would remain in the family, but that was all. It was a progression of his thinking, a ""slope line,"" recalled Harvey Dale, who thought Feeney reached the decision some time between 1980 and 1982. ""Chuck's time clock is different from that of anybody I know. He quite often takes important decisions and sort of lets them marinate. Time passes until he gets to some place internally where he has comfort with a direction."" Feeney himself cannot remember a ""going-over-the-cliff"" moment. Nor did he philosophise much about his decision after he reached it. ""I came to the conclusion I didn't need a lot of money because I didn't intend to live a lifestyle that required it,"" he said simply. ******* SETTING UP A registered charity with the specific provisions Feeney wanted proved complex. The foundation had, for example, to get around Bermuda's very narrow interpretation of charitable activities - which did not permit giving to sports, something that, with his love of sport, Feeney might want to do. Establishing a unique charity that could give anonymously, possess businesses, and operate worldwide required in the end a special act of the Bermuda parliament. In 1981, Harvey Dale engaged an English-born lawyer, Frank Mutch, from the island's biggest law firm, Conyers Dill & Pearman, to help draft the necessary legislation. A year later, they presented their draft bill to the Private Bills Committee in the Bermuda Assembly. It provided for setting up a charitable foundation to be called the Atlantic Foundation. To reassure the parliamentarians they were genuine, the bill empowered the Bermuda Charity Commissioners to oversee the Atlantic Foundation's operations. The committee approved the Atlantic Foundation Company Act, 1982, and it was nodded through the red-carpeted House of Assembly. The foundation documents were lodged with the company registrar at 30 Parliament Street in Hamilton, and the Atlantic Foundation was officially set up on March 1st, 1982, with an initial lodgement of $5 million and the declared aim of helping projects across the world to relieve poverty and suffering, to advance education, and to help causes such as health, children and youth, old age, and international justice. ******* ACQUAINTANCES REMARKED THAT they never heard him engage in introspection and that he used his sense of humour to keep his inner self at a distance. Instead of explaining what was going on in his mind, he would give friends and family members articles or cuttings from magazines and newspapers. They had to infer the message. Giving out copies of ""Wealth"" was a clever way of enlightening them on the essence of his giving. He also kept a copy of Carnegie's essay on his desk. Andrew Carnegie was not a precise role model for Chuck Feeney. The Scottish philanthropist made his fortune through harsh and ruthless business methods, and he loved having his name on libraries and schools, neither of which applied to Feeney. But his basic message was clear - give while alive. Those to whom Feeney handed a copy of ""Wealth"" were left in no doubt that he was intent on giving away most if not all of the fortune he had accumulated in the duty-free business, and that he meant to turn his back on the conspicuous consumption that in the 1980s was coming to characterise what would be known as the ""Decade of Greed"". All Feeney's instincts, instilled in him by the example of his parents, by the sharing culture of his blue-collar upbringing in New Jersey, by his desire not to distance himself from his boyhood neighbours and friends, and by his own innate kindness and concern for others, undoubtedly shaped his decision. In New Jersey's Elmora neighbourhood, you helped people and you didn't flaunt riches that came with success or boast about your good works. Although the mechanism had been put in place, Dale was unwilling to let Feeney commit substantial assets to the foundation until he saw that it was working in the way they intended. He counselled Feeney to run it for a couple of years as a ""pass-through entity"" with money going in and being donated out. Also, there had not been complete discussion or agreement between Chuck and Danielle about the amount that would be set aside for her and the kids. ""But Chuck was clear then that this was the only exception. Everything else was going to go in."" ******* FEENEY AND DALE had ""serious conversations"" about the enormity of what he was set to do. ""One of the things we both understood was that whatever the value of the assets was, except for the amount that was set aside for Danielle and the kids, all of that was going in, and this was a very unusual decision, probably unique in the history of the world. I said, 'You ought to be sure about this because if you change your mind in three weeks it's too bad. The assets are gone, and you can't get them back, and you can't use them', and I was very stern with him about that. That made no impact on him because he knew that he understood that, and that was exactly and precisely what he wanted."" ******* WITH THE FUTURE of DFS secured for several years after the renewal of the Hawaii and Alaska concessions, Chuck Feeney reached an agreement with Danielle that when the day came to sign everything away, $40 million and the houses would be held back for her and the children, and the money paid out over a few years. It was the figure thought necessary to take care of ""the houses and the kids and education and clothes and boats and artworks, jewellery,"" recalled Harvey Dale. The Atlantic Foundation had worked well in the two years since its creation in 1982. The Feeneys channelled $15 million through the foundation in that time, of which $14 million went to Cornell. Cornell had given him everything, his Ivy League education, his launchpad to the world, his network of loyal friends. It would always have first call on his generosity. Feeney was overwhelmingly grateful to the Ivy League university for giving him the self-confidence to prosper in business. ******* BY NOVEMBER 1984, they were ready to transfer everything into the foundation. But a wealth transfer of great magnitude in the territory of Bermuda would require the payment of stamp duty that their lawyer Frank Mutch reckoned could be in the region of $40 million. They decided to do the transaction in the Bahamas. There would be no stamp duty, if it was not a gift to the foundation but a purchase by the foundation, and if this occurred outside Bermuda. As everything was in Danielle's name, it was arranged that the foundation would issue promissory notes to purchase the assets from her, namely, the DFS shareholding and the businesses, over a specific time period. They set a date for the transaction: Friday, November 23rd, the day after American Thanksgiving. It required the presence of Chuck and Danielle and the two lawyers, Frank Mutch and Harvey Dale. The Feeneys and Mutch arrived that morning at Nassau International Airport on flights from New York and Bermuda. Dale was due to fly in from West Palm Beach, but a thunderstorm lingered over the airport and delayed his flight. When the passengers were finally boarded and the captain announced, ""I think there's a window in the weather, and we can get out if you all are willing,"" he found himself almost shouting, ""We're all ready to do it."" He remembered the occasion as being as near to a disaster as he could imagine. ""It was mid-afternoon, almost four, when I arrived,"" said Dale. ""The Trust Company closes at 5.00pm.The plane landed, I ran out of the plane, jumped into a taxi, ran up the stairs to the conference room, everybody was sitting around twiddling their fingers waiting for me. The closing had been scheduled to take two to three hours.We had one hour."" ""Good to see you,"" said Feeney as Dale entered, and they rushed through the closing. When all the documents were signed, the Atlantic Foundation had purchased the assets from Danielle by issuing non-negotiable promissory notes, through an underlying company called Exeter, for payment to her of $40 million over a number of years. In addition, Danielle retained the nonbusiness assets, principally the Feeney homes in various parts of the world, valued at $20-$30 million. With the stroke, or several strokes, of a pen in the law office, Chuck Feeney, at the age of 53, had signed away his fortune, though as chairman of his foundation he could influence what was done with it. He was by no means a pauper, and he would also still be running the businesses as chairman of General Atlantic Group Ltd and drawing an annual salary, even though his business empire was now wholly and irrevocably owned by his foundation. But he had gone from the cusp of billionaire status to someone with a net worth of less than $5 million. He would joke later: ""How to become a millionaire? Become a billionaire first!"" Although it was one of the biggest single transfers of wealth in history, not one of the people intimately involved could put a precise figure on what it was worth, even to the nearest hundred million. The foundation would later put it conservatively at $500 million. Frank Mutch believes that the total value of Feeney's assets then could have been $600 million. Harvey Dale reckons it could have been as high as $800 million, a sum equivalent to the gross domestic product of Fiji or Barbados (that if invested at an annual return of 7 per cent would be worth $3.8 billion in 2007). Paul Hannon, hired by Feeney as his general counsel two years earlier, suggested in a contemporaneous private memo that the assets were worth between $500 million and $1 billion, rivalling the capital of sizeable investment banking firms such as Bear Stearns and far outstripping Morgan Stanley. The difficulty in making a precise calculation arose from the fact that DFS was a private multinational and the value of Feeney's 38.75 per cent shareholding was ""in the eye of the beholder"", as he put it. On the basis of an offer for the company that Tony Pilaro had made that year to buy out the other owners for $610 million (in the end he couldn't raise the cash), Feeney's equity was worth some $236 million. But if DFS had been floated on the stock market, its value could have been much higher. On top of that, General Atlantic's fast-growing holdings and investments were by this stage worth several hundred million dollars, perhaps half a billion or more. Among themselves, Feeney and Dale referred to the foundation's assets as being divided into ""church"" and ""state,"" with ""church"" signifying liquid assets for making grants and ""state"" being the businesses and the DFS shareholding. With the transfer, 90 per cent of the assets were in ""state"" - an unheard of proportion among modern charitable foundations, which rarely control any businesses at all. There was no celebratory drink or meal after the signing. Everyone rushed to catch their evening flights out of Nassau, Chuck and Danielle heading to New York, Harvey Dale back to West Palm Beach, Frank Mutch to Bermuda. As far as Danielle was concerned, it was just another of her husband's business transactions, though one of great importance. She always did what her husband decided in such matters and she knew the assets weren't hers, though they had been in her name. Harvey Dale was her lawyer, too, and they were both friendly with Dale's family. She felt it was not for her to refuse, and she did not want it to become an issue in their marriage. She did not feel deprived in any way, though the $40 million was a fraction of the actual value of the assets. But she would not look back on it in time as a happy event. As the 1980s progressed, friends noted that she and Chuck were living increasingly separate lives. Feeney was always on the road, now more than ever, as his business and philanthropic interests consumed almost all his time. Some time afterward, she began to feel resentful and confused about the future. She felt something very bad and serious had happened in her life. She began to worry about the children being disinherited. Her relationship with Harvey Dale became very strained. She believed that the lawyer had too great an influence on her husband, and she made her feelings known to him in verbal exchanges in no uncertain terms on a number of occasions when they met. The Feeney children were not sure what to make of their father's relationship with the New York lawyer. They wondered among themselves about the extent of Harvey Dale's influence, whether he had manipulated their father in any way, or if it was a case of Maimonides influencing Dale and Dale influencing their father. But they had little doubt that the idea of giving while living had germinated in their father's mind for a long time. Feeney readily agreed that Harvey Dale was the most influential person in his life. ""Yes, absolutely,"" he said. ""He is impeccably honest and is also a good person as a human being. He knew my motivations. The idea never changed in my mind - use your wealth to help people, use your wealth to create institutions to help people. I think he has the same pragmatic view that I have."" ""Harvey was very influential,"" said Frank Mutch. ""He was the one behind it all, really. He espoused Chuck's ideas. The unique feature was that Chuck never made any arrangement for himself to be provided for."" Feeney's legal counsel, Paul Hannon, felt that Dale not only interpreted his wishes but ""to some extent he created Chuck's wishes."" Diane Feeney, the youngest daughter, recalled that some time after 1984, Harvey Dale explained the implications of the creation of the foundation to family members. ""I remember Harvey coming to see every single one of us,"" she said. ""I was in Cornell at the time. He dragged me out of a football game, so you knew it had to be pretty major, sat me down and explained that Dad wanted to give all his money away to charity, this was in the process of being implemented, and he wanted to tell us about it."" ******* NO ONE IN the world of philanthropy in the United States or elsewhere was aware that a major new player had come on the scene. Dale, who assumed the role of president and chief executive of the Atlantic Foundation, required everyone involved in setting up the foundation to sign a highly lawyered confidentiality agreement, drawn up by the Manhattan law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, to protect Feeney's privacy. Strict rules were formulated for the conduct of the foundation. No solicitations would be entertained. Gifts would be made anonymously, and those who received them would not be told where they came from. The recipients, too, would have to sign confidentiality agreements. If they found out anything about the Atlantic Foundation or Chuck Feeney and made it public, the money would stop. The Atlantic Foundation would be the biggest secret foundation of its size in the world. From the start, Chuck Feeney was adamant that he did not want recognition for his giving. There would be no plaques or names on buildings he funded, no black-tie ""thank-you"" dinners, no honorary degrees. People should not know that he was behind the foundation. Beneficiaries should not even be told its name. From the book The Billionaire Who Wasn't: How Chuck Feeney Secretly Made and Gave Away a Fortune by Conor O'Clery. Copyright © 2007.

The Irish Times,Aug-25,2018,25-Aug-18,Fed chairman makes case for more interest rate rises,"US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the fundamentals of the US economic expansion look strong and support the case for continued gradual interest-rate increases. ""There is good reason to expect that this strong performance will continue,"" Mr Powell said yesterday at the Kansas City Fed's annual policy symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ""I believe that this gradual process of normalisation remains appropriate."" US central bankers are raising interest rates gradually to keep inflation in check while at the same time giving the nearly decade-long expansion room to run. The Fed has signalled it will lift rates again next month, with a December move also widely expected.  The policy has attracted the ire of President Donald Trump, who said in a recent interview that he was ""not thrilled"" with the Fed's tightening. US stocks rose and the dollar slipped as investors digested Mr Powell's first speech as Fed chief at Jackson Hole. Yields on the 10-year treasury note were initially lifted before settling back to levels prior to his remarks. Mr Powell's speech discussed at length the challenges of monetary policy at a time when economic benchmarks - such as estimates of full employment or the neutral policy rate - are uncertain. The two risks faced by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are moving too fast and shortening the expansion, or moving too slowly and allowing for overheating and financial excesses, he said. Overheating  ""I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC's approach to taking seriously both of these risks,"" Mr Powell said. While unemployment is below the committee's longer-run estimate of a rate that corresponds with non-inflationary use of labour resources, ""there does not seem to be an elevated risk of overheating"".  ""This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from the ongoing normalisation process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually,"" Mr Powell said.  ""As the most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate."" Investors are pricing in another quarter-point increase from the central bank at their meeting next month. That would raise the target range for the benchmark lending rate to 2 per cent to 2.25 per cent. Odds of a second hike before year-end in December were little changed around 64 per cent. There is scant evidence that the Fed's removal of stimulus is hurting growth. Unemployment is low at 3.9 per cent, and inflation, according to the Fed's preferred benchmark, is slightly above officials' 2 per cent target.  - Bloomberg",1
