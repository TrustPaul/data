Of a total of almost 730,000 mortgages, more than 52,000, or 7%, are behind on their repayments - with almost 16,000 in long-term arrears of more than five years. In a speech to the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland yesterday, Central Bank deputy governor Ed Sibley stressed that 'resolution of long-term mortgage arrears remains a key policy priority for the Central Bank', and is 'receiving significant focus'. However, his intervention was described by housing campaigner David Hall as 'too late' for thousands of homeowners. Mr Hall, head of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, said: 'This is no surprise. The last mortgage arrears crisis is not resolved and the Central Bank has had its head in the sand, the Government has had its head in the sand and this will come back to haunt them. He's only telling the truth... many people will be homeless unless they get their act together. 'It's been ten years for the banks to do something but they've ignored it. It's a bit late now, too late to apologise.' Mr Sibley said the combination of supports offered by lenders and the Government during the coronavirus pandemic, such as repayment holidays, had been crucial in minimising the economic effects of the emergency on households and businesses. However, he warned that as Government support is reduced, some borrowers will require further financial support, and that the Central Bank expects lenders and borrowers to 'proactively engage to develop, tailor and implement solutions according to individual borrower circumstances using a wide range of solutions'. He added: 'Lenders' strategies, plans and commitments submitted to the Central Bank, together with our supervisory follow-up, provide a good degree of assurance that lenders are ready and committed to provide the necessary support to those borrowers as we move to the next phase of the pandemic. It is critically important that these plans and the engagement with borrowers are executed well and in line with our expectations. This will be a key focus of our supervisory efforts over the coming months.' On long-term mortgage arrears, he said that while significant progress has been made in resolving this crisis, much of it due to the Central Bank's interventions, solutions still need to be found those remaining borrowers in deep arrears. He also told those in arrears 'to engage with their lender or the other supports available, like MABS [the Money Advice and Budgeting Service] or the Insolvency Service, for help'. Rachel McGovern, Brokers Ireland director of financial services, said that 'restructures such as ""arrears capitalisation"" are effectively a method of kicking the can down the road'. She added: 'The taboo around debt needs to be addressed and consumers need to be encouraged to engage at an early stage when encountering issues with repayments.' christian.mccashin@dailymail.ie 'Kicking the can down the road'"

In an assessment of the likely impact of global tax reforms on Ireland, debt ratings firm DBRS Morningstar, however, describes the risks to the State as ""distant"" while noting Ireland enjoys significant non-tax benefits that should keep it competitive. It said that the proposed changes envisioned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 had two distinct pillars - a reallocation of taxing rights and a global minimum rate, ""each with possible varying effects on Ireland's budget, its existing capital stock, and future direct investment"". Consensus will, however, be difficult to achieve and implement, it said. Under pillar one of the OECD reforms a proportion of profits booked in Ireland would be reallocated and inevitably reduce Ireland's corporate tax take, DBRS said, noting the Irish Government had already budgeted for EUR 2 billion of losses arising from the this. A global minimum rate - set at 15 per cent, envisioned under pillar two, will ""be more consequential"", it said. This would require Irish domiciled corporates to ""top up"" their tax contributions. An attempt to accurately model how a new corporate tax regime would affect Ireland would need to reflect a full range of negative impacts including those on employment and incomes.  Intangible assets  ""Most impactfully, a forced change to Ireland's tax rate might spur firms to reassess their commitment to Ireland and shift activities or intangible assets to other jurisdictions that do not comply with the new global minimum standards,"" it said.  ""An exit of a handful of large multinationals could have large spillover consequences to the rest of the economy.""  The company cites recent research by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac), which warned a ""pillar 2-like shock""involving five large multinationals redomiciling their business away from Ireland could result in a direct corporate tax loss of EUR 3 billion and a direct loss of 5,000 jobs and 15,000 indirect job losses, resulting in higher unemployment and emigration. In its report, DBRS also cautioned that the concentration of corporate tax receipts in only a handful of companies - over 50 per cent of receipts come from just 10 large firm - exposes the Irish exchequer to budget risks.  ""This complicates the forecasting of revenues and the funding of permanent expenditures,"" it said. ""These concentration risks are amplified by the ongoing efforts to reform the global business tax landscape.""  Nonetheless, it described the State's corporation tax base as ""resilient"". It also noted that ""years of the multinational sector's large tax windfalls was helpful in repairing the government's public finances after the global financial crisis"". DBRS also concluded that Ireland had significant non-tax benefits that should keep it competitive, even if reforms cause more structural change to the Irish economic model. It highlighted Ireland's highly skilled labour force, its use of the English language and common law, unfettered access to the European Union, and its favourable climate for doing business."

This was apparently how the housewives of Mayo - as seemingly distinct from the housewives of any other Irish county - were operating in 1966. That's the year Ireland was included in a series of books published by the US Time-Life International company, in its World Library imprint. The series featured countries around the world: China, tropical Africa, Russian Scandinavia, Japan, eastern Europe, and many more. I have most of the set, picked up here and there over the years in second-hand bookshops.  These books featuring different countries were intended to be snapshots of the era they were written in. So what was Ireland like - as seen from an American perspective - in 1966, more than half a century ago? Well, for a start, surprise surprise, Irish women were clearly seen as inferior to men. It starts on the cover, which depicts a solitary person: an older man, fag in hand, leaning over a stone wall on Inis Mór. No women in sight, which is more or less where they remain throughout the book, reductively referred to through the text as ""housewives"" or ""mothers"". ""The father is the head of the closely knit family, and although he never pushes a perambulator or washes dishes, he takes charge of the boys when they reach the age of seven or eight."" We never learn what this father actually does with his small sons once they reach seven and eight - bring them to the pub? ""The Irishman seldom drinks at home, partly because his wife, like most middle-class Irishwomen, is likely to be a teetotaller. He prefers having his glass of stout in the male company that he finds in a pub."" Grim picture  The writer presents a grim picture of the home life of a middle-class teetotal subservient Irish housewife. ""The housewife does not eat dinner until the men have left the table. She has no part in her husband's social life; he goes off with his sons and other men to the village pub and to football and hurling matches while she stays home with her daughters."" The relationship between mothers and sons is presented as weirdly intense, and hinted at as an emotionally stronger bond than  hers with her husband. A connection with daughters is never mentioned.  ""The attachment between an Irish mother and her son is strong. She sees to it that her son gets the best cut of the meat, sometimes better than the one she serves to her husband. She secretly slips him money for a dance. She hates the thought of him leaving home to marry, and in many cases, so does he."" Is this how the ""Irish mammy"" trope started out?  The Irish mother who doesn't want to see her beloved son marry, will, however, happily part with him if he embraces God instead of a future housewife.  ""The church is the one thing that comes before obligations to the beloved family. The mother who is reluctant to see her son married will never raise her voice in protest if he decides to go off to Africa as a missionary for the rest of his life."" The church gets an entire chapter to itself, written throughout with a tone of breathless hagiography.  'Clan leader'  ""The priest is deeply involved, directly or indirectly, in everything in his town, and he is an unofficial clan leader, consulted for advice and guidance not only in matters of family trouble but also in business or legal disputes, arguments over the ownership of livestock or land boundaries and squabbles about the selection of the local football team. In certain aspects of town and county government that concern social life, the priest's word is law. ""Like a general in an army community, he belongs to a special high caste. He is too respected and honoured for his calling to be treated like other men."" There is a full-page colour picture of a priest in his clerical garb, in a  picturesque green field with a castle and four small children with their sheepdog. The caption reads: ""A priest shows a tender regard for his charges.""  Decades would pass before the population learned what some priests had been doing to the children in their charge. The writer is approving of the Irish body image, and theorises as to why that may be. ""The old-fashioned custom of eating dinner at noon and a light supper in the evening may account for the slimness of both men and women in Ireland; a foreign visitor realises after a few days that he has seen few fat people."" And so to politics.  ""The big change of the 1960s in Ireland, shaping a new course for the future, is the country's abandonment of its stubborn nationalism of the last half-century."" Well, we all know what happened next in Northern Ireland.  Ireland's possible entry into the European Common Market was mulled over. ""A provocative question is what will happen to Ireland's partition if North and South end up as fellow members of the Common Market. Inevitably, the economies of the two regions will become increasingly interrelated. If that happens, some members of the government argue, the partition will not last long."" Fifty-five years later, with Northern Ireland having since joined and then left the EU, that same discussion continues to be relevant.  As for us ""housewives"" of Ireland, thankfully we are no longer the subservient citizens we were made out to be in 1966."

I was quite comfortable with having loans for cars and using credit cards. I just earned money and spent money, and that was it. 'I But then, at the end of summer 2019, I got my annual pension document from work. I usually just filed them away and didn't pay much attention, but this time I had a read through it because I was quite curious. It said my retirement date was 2048. It was the first time I had seen the date in black and white, and it shocked me. I remember thinking, 'I'm not going to do that. I need to sort out my finances and figure out how to bring that date forward as much as possible'. It was a really hard thing to do but I printed off three months of bank statements. I rarely use cash so it was a nearly perfect view of where my money was going and it just shocked me. I never planned meals so my food bills were really high. It's only myself and my partner in the house and I was spending some months close to (EURO)1,000 on food. And it was just from not being organised and popping to the shop after work. I was also following a lot of people on social media and buying whatever they recommended. That's fine if it's once or twice a month but I was literally buying everything and it was adding up. After looking through the statements, I identified the bills that I still needed to pay and the bills that I could get rid of or reduce. I didn't cancel Netflix or Spotify, for example, but there were a lot of subscriptions that I wasn't using at all. Before that, I would see the direct debits coming out of my account every month but it was always too much hassle to cancel them. Next, I looked at my mobile and broadband bills and asked if I could get them cheaper elsewhere. Then I set myself a grocery bill budget and unfollowed a lot of influencers online because I was being influenced to part with my money and it wasn't helping matters. At the time I had two credit cards, one car loan and one personal loan. The highest interest was on the credit cards so I attacked those first with a 0pc credit transfer. Then I paid off the personal loans and the car loans. I was properly determined and it took me 18 months to pay off (EURO)27,759. After paying off the debt, I started saving about (EURO)3,000 a month for an early retirement. I'm involved in the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) meet-up group in Limerick. People from different backgrounds and of all ages share information on saving, investment moves and their plans to retire early. It's brilliant to meet like-minded people because a few years ago this information was only coming from the US. I'd like to retire by 50. My partner is 10 years older than me and he plans to retire at 55. He started saving a lot earlier than I did and he has things in place to make that happen, while I'm still catching up. We looked at our expenses and we worked out how much we'll need per year before our pension kicks in. If I reach that figure before I turn 50 then that's great, but if it's maybe a little later, then that's fine too. It's nice to have a target age because I'd like to enjoy life while I still have the time. It's really about sitting down and saying, 'How much is coming in and how much do I have to pay out in order to live?' I now save for short-term things like Christmas, birthdays and nights out. I have an emergency fund should I lose my job and another fund for laser eye surgery. And then I have longer-term savings like investment funds and individual stocks. I'm not stingy or anything like that. I still buy Charlotte Tilbury makeup and good skincare products. The only difference is that I now budget for it and I don't impulse buy anymore. Every time a new temptation comes up I think, 'Do I need it or am I just falling for marketing tricks?' I also keep a wish list of sorts. If I see something I really like or if I hear something new is coming out, I put it on the list. And by the time I've saved up for it, the chances are I've gone off it or I don't want it anymore. Meanwhile, I'm doing a few things to bring in extra money, like online surveys that pay you for taking part and matched betting, which involves using the free bets that bookies give you to bet on both outcomes of a game. Let's say it's a football match. You use your free bet to bet that Liverpool are going to win and you use your own money to pay for a bet that says Liverpool are going to lose. Of course you have to be careful of it because the next step up is gambling and when you're on the site you might see something that is too good to be true. Last October I brought out a meal planner that I sell on Etsy. I was about to follow it up with a financial planner just before the first lockdown but I decided it wasn't the right time. My friends and family support my saving. Okay, there have been some nights out where I didn't go. All my friends are in Dublin so going out means staying somewhere and that can be quite expensive. But everything else I just save up for. I haven't really changed my lifestyle all that much, albeit there's a lot more money going to savings - and a lot less deliveries from ASOS and Amazon! Paying off the loans gave me the confidence that I can manage my money and make it grow. Had I not started I'd probably have another new car or maybe a higher credit card limit. Before I started saving, I couldn't have even told you how much I owed on credit cards or how much the broadband cost each month. Everything got paid but I never knew the exact amounts. Now it's empowering to be on top of things because then you don't have to worry. I've realised that everything in society is designed to make us spend money. We were looking at cars recently and at the moment it's hard to find the outright price because all of the car companies only tell you how much it will cost per month or per week. Everything is set up to make us part with our cash and it's hard to beat that. So you almost have to consciously do the opposite of what you're being forced to do every day.""

In 64 years of competing in Europe, an Irish club has never managed to overturn a two-goal deficit from the first leg and progress, while the Hoops' opponents tonight have a 100pc record from their past encounters with Irish clubs, six games and six wins. Yet the Dublin club hope that recent history, and in particular a game where they put up some resistance against an AC Milan side containing the future player of the tournament at Euro 2020, Gianluigi Donnarumma, can feed positivity into their camp and keep alive hopes of a clash with Young Boys Berne in the second qualifying round. Donnarumma kept a clean sheet against Rovers in Dublin in the Europa League last year in a 2-0 win but while Rovers manager Stephen Bradley insists there's nothing to be learned from Slovan's 4-1 aggregate Europa League win over Dundalk in 2019, that 2020 meeting with Milan could point the way for the Hoops. ""They beat us 2-0 and were always expected to beat us. But what pleased me more than anything after the game was that we tried to play, as opposed to being safe,"" says Alan Mannus, Rovers' veteran goalkeeper. ""From goal-kicks, we tried to play out from the back, we tried to play rather than everybody going up the pitch and we'd go long. That was the pleasing thing for me. That's what we need to try to do tonight, to be brave. If we can try do it against AC Milan, we can do it against anybody. When we did it against AC, there were times when we got into the final third to create chances. It shows you that we can be good at it."" Membership of the Goalkeepers' Union means that even a famous figure like Donnarumma finds time to chat to his opposite number, and the Italian No 1 was complimentary when speaking to Mannus. ""I thought he was brilliant against us, the saves he made against Aaron Greene,"" Mannus said. ""We actually spoke about it afterwards, we talked a lot about when Aaron got in during the first half. He's one of the top of the top goalkeepers in the world,"" added Mannus, who predicted in advance of Sunday's Euro 2020 final that Donnarumma and Jordan Pickford would each save two penalties. A penalty save by Mannus late on in the first leg, denying Slovan's Euro 2020 star Vladimir Weiss a goal which would have made it 3-0 and would have all but ended Irish interest in the tie, was a key moment for Rovers. Penalties And penalties could come into the equation in Tallaght tonight, a game where Rovers can welcome a crowd of 1,500, as the away goal rule is no longer in place, but of course Rovers need to score twice to make that happen with the constant threat that a classy Slovan side, managed by veteran coach Vladimir Weiss, a man very familiar with Dublin from tests here with Slovakia and Georgia, score early to really kill off the tie. ""If they score, it makes it more difficult but ultimately we need to do whatever we can to get through. If they score, we've to score one extra on top of the two already,"" says Mannus. ""I don't think that if they score, we're out of it completely. We've shown already this season that we can come back from being in a bad position. We just need to do whatever it takes to get through."" They are missing one of their Euro 2020 stars, Hungary's Dávid Holman, through injury but Slovakian international Vladimir Weiss, son of the coach with the same name, could start for Slovan, whose experience in Europe last season was scarred by Covid-19: they were dumped out of the Champions League without a ball being kicked as they were unable to field a team against Faroe Islands opposition due to two Covid outbreaks and lost to Finnish opposition in the Europa League."

He continues to expand his enterprise, run in partnership with his son John and daughter Emer. ""Our arms were tied behind our back - buying expensive milk quotas every year, it was very difficult to build up a herd,"" he says. Today, he is president of the Irish Holstein Friesian Association, and a judge at dairy shows at home and abroad. Bucket ""I grew up on a dairy farm at Horseleap, between Moate and Kilbeggan,"" he says. ""In the early '60s up to 25 cows were being milked by hand on the farm by my brother Tommy and my mother and myself. We all had our own cows to milk and bucket. ""Then a DeLaval bucket plant was installed which was a novelty at that time, then around 1967-68 a new six-unit parlour. We kept building cows up all the time to 40 and 50 after getting more quota from Snowcream."" PJ was sent to boarding school, doing his Leaving Cert in 1971 and then on to study at Rockwell Agricultural College, with no clear career plan in mind. ""Then it all came to me that farming was exactly what I wanted to do,"" he says, explaining that a teacher suggested the Farm Apprenticeship Scheme. For his first year in the scheme he was placed at a 180-cow dairy farm in Co Wicklow belonging to Tommy Jackson - a man ""at least 50 years ahead of his time in farming practices"". He stayed there for a second year, then moved to Denis Howard's dairy and tillage farm at Killavullen, Co Cork where he developed ""a very good knowledge of herd management, grass management and tillage"". After completing his apprenticeship, he took up a position as farm manager for John Barrett at Lenaghmore, Togher, Co Cork for three years, ""where I got the real love for pedigree cows and breeding"". Returning home to Westmeath in 1977 he was given an outfarm of 65ac at Rochfortbridge and started to develop it with some tillage crops, but his ambition was to build up a good dairy herd. ""When it came to 1984 I was snookered because the milk quota was in,"" he says. ""Cows was always what I wanted but I didn't get into cows until the later '80s when Larry Goodman had taken over Westmeath Co-op for a short period. ""There was some small amount of quota transferred from my home farm to Rochfortbridge and that gave me a start. I was then eligible to buy quota."" He started with 14 cows but he couldn't expand because of the quotas. ""I spent £180,000 ((EURO)230,000) down the years because most of the quota that I had was bought - it was hard to get and expensive. With one stroke of a pen in 2015 that was taken away,"" he says. ""We had built up slowly to match the quota we had - 20 to 30 to 40 cows and so on - because that was all that could be done."" In 1999 his son John, who had completed his college education, returned to form a partnership; they could get more quota because he was a young farmer. ""It is so much easier now because suckler farmers have stock, they have sheds, and they don't need quota to pump out all the milk they want,"" PJ says. ""I'm not begrudging them that. It is a good thing. In 2015 it suited me too to expand further. We were milking 110 cows and had a quota of 140,000 gallons."" Since 2015 land has been bought and three farms leased, bringing to area farmed to around 400ac - and the dairy herd has been doubled to over 200 cows with an average yield of 2,100 gallons. All the calves are reared on the farm. The males are kept for sale as bulls for breeding and the balance sold at 20-22 months as young bull beef, with many achieving carcase weights of 360-400 kg of O/P grade. ""We just don't like selling calves for (EURO)10-30,"" says PJ. ""At any stage if they are well done, they can be sold as stores at 380-400kg to get a good return on them."" Mostly Canadian and US bulls are used for breeding, with concentration on increasing production, with a ready market for bulls for breeding each season. ""Our customers for bulls nearly always come back for more because they are getting milk from them,"" says PJ. ""Litres of milk in the tank is what they need and I find that EBI is not a major feature."" The heifers are reared for herd replacement and expansion and sale of the surplus for breeding. Cereals A considerable acreage is now devoted to growing cereals for feeding to the herd. PJ's youngest daughter Emer, who has shown an interest in farming since she was three years old, has now joined the farm partnership, having graduated with first class honours in ag science, spending her practical year milking 1,200 cows on a farm in New Zealand. On further expansion, PJ says: ""We would probably lease land now. We find it is cheaper option to expand because land purchase is very expensive and is a very big undertaking.

I would watch videos on YouTube and think, 'Wouldn't that be an amazing thing to do one day?' Then, almost three years ago, I met Adam on Bumble. From our first date we got talking and realised that we both had dreams of living in a van. It actually turned out that he had inherited a van from his mum and he was about to go off travelling for three months around Europe. On our third date I went to visit him for 10 days in Croatia when he was doing his Europe trip, then we drove down to Montenegro. That was my first taste of van life and I just loved it. I loved the idea that everything you want and need is there, yet you can park up beside mountains, lakes or a castle. When Adam and I actually got together, we very quickly decided to do van life full-time. Then we took the steps towards making it happen. It isn't the done thing to pack up all your things and live tiny so when you find someone who is willing to go off and do something like that, you definitely click. Adam is a filmmaker and my job is in advertising. Our jobs are not the easiest to do while we're off-grid. Usually I would need to be in an office to do that job in a team, so I saved up in order to be able to afford the first year of travel, before going freelance. I also moved in with Adam before the trip so that we were saving that way as well. Our van - or Jits as we call her - is very much our home now. We went back to London after our first big year of van travel where we sublet a room to ground ourselves. We took that time to save up for our next adventure, which we're on now, and which will be another year or more. Our savings go a long way in the van. We're very good at budgeting and van life is so much cheaper than living in London, and certainly cheaper than living in Dublin where the rents are ridiculous. But that's not to say that we haven't made money while on the road. We were fortunate to get a commission for Tourism Ireland to use some of our footage and we also created a film for them. That actually paid for a full two months while we were travelling around Ireland, and it also sparked a little idea. What we would like to do now is work with tourism boards and brands that are in the same sphere so that we can be making money while we're travelling. A lot of people tell us they could never do this lifestyle because they have too much stuff. But I have come from a point where I held on to loads of clothes and a bunch of things. I found it really difficult to let go of these items and I'm constantly in that process so it hasn't been second nature to me by any stretch of the imagination. What I have realised, though, is that when you rid yourself of those material possessions, you feel a lot lighter. To be honest, that was one of the learnings from last time. We packed too much stuff and you end up wearing the same thing over and over again. That now translates to the rest of our lives and making sure we're choosing quality over quantity. We're intentional with our purchases and our time. And there is not one thing that I have donated that I miss. We get asked about our relationship a lot. I think in order to live in a small space, you need to have a certain dynamic and you need to be the sort of people who are patient, who have a sense of humour and who don't take things too seriously. You also have to be okay with planning but also with being flexible. We do our workouts separately - albeit right next to the van. And there are other ways to switch off, whether it's reading a book, or working in the office area of the van while the other is in the kitchen washing up. Adam and I are both only children. We're both very independent and we both love to be alone, but because we get each other, we never have to leave the van to get some time away. In the last couple of years there has been a surge of interest in van life, in particular because of Covid. Van life allows you to travel and I guess it's the safest way to travel because you have everything you need with you. You're completely self-contained and you don't have to worry about checking into a hotel or hostel. That was one of the major advantages when we found ourselves on a Portuguese farm for three months during lockdown. When the borders opened up again and we were allowed to travel, being in the van meant that we could 100pc avoid people and the only way we came into contact with others was when we had to fill up with petrol or pick up our groceries. If Jits doesn't last - unfortunately she has lots of rust issues - we'd love to buy a bus, convert it and have a small family and travel around in the bus. Another dream would be to get some land in Mexico and build a tiny home there. It's interesting how our life plans and trajectory have changed since living in a van. Before I met Adam, I had my heart set on being really career-focussed and working my way up the corporate ladder. And while that can 100pc bring people happiness - and in a different world that would have brought me happiness - living in a van made me realise that I love the sense of adventure. I love not knowing where I'm going to sleep the next night. You realise if there is so much beauty in one little island like Ireland, then how much more beauty is there in the rest of the world and why not prioritise that now by building it into your lifestyle versus my original plan which was 'work, work, work and then, when I retire, I'll travel'. When you look at Instagram under the hashtag 'van life', you'll see a lot of amazing photos of twenty-somethings. But there are two things to consider: first, that's Instagram and the realities of van life, like having to empty your toilets, aren't always portrayed. And second, it doesn't matter how old or how young you are. Van life is for everyone. In saying that, I think it's better to start this lifestyle sooner rather than later. Nothing is certain in life and you cannot assume that you'll live to old age - and even if you do, you may not have the energy. The most heart-warming messages we receive are from people in their 50s who have seen our videos and who tell us that they have decided not to wait until they retire - it's so inspiring.""

Barr, who is chief operating officer but has taken on the main role to bridge the gap between Paul Flynn and Tom Parsons, said he has been ""surprised"" since he joined the players body at how some commentators seek to ""drive a wedge"" between the club and intercounty games. ""Inter-county games are the financial heartbeat of the Gaelic games family,"" said Barr in his address. ""They attract the attendances; they attract the media coverage; they attract the commercial revenue. ""This commercial revenue is then distributed down along the chain to all units of the GAA. It is those units that provide the volunteers, develop the facilities and nurture players, some of whom progress to intercounty level. ""The inter-county game cannot thrive without the club game; the club game cannot thrive without the inter-county game. Barr (pictured) said it ""surprises"" him that such focus is placed on the ""unsustainability"" of costs in preparing inter-county teams. ""I find it difficult to square the two. Could we all be more efficient and effective with our investments and expenditure? Undoubtedly. Are costs associated with inter-county games 'unsustainable'? That's a far more nuanced question to answer so let's look at the revenue generated in 2019 v 2020. ""In 2019, with a thriving intercounty game, the GAA generated record revenues, 83 cent in every euro of which was invested back into schools, clubs, counties and provinces. ""In 2020, revenues generated by the inter-county game fell off a cliff due to Covid-19 and GAA units across the country and overseas were left with little to no investment as the GAA just didn't have the money. The money spent on the inter-county game is not a cost, it's an investment; an investment that all units of the GAA benefit from."""

The Covid orphans of India; More than 3,000 Indian children have been orphaned during the pandemic",FALSE,"In a small, colourfully painted house on India's eastern coast, G Sonali Reddy cooks meals and feeds her younger siblings by day and rocks them to sleep at night, hoping to assuage their fears, just as her mother would.  Reddy (14) is her family's caretaker. Several years ago, her father took his own life after the failure of the family's business selling spare trolley parts. Then in May, her mother, Sabita, contracted Covid-19 as a calamitous wave of infections swept across India. Within hours of reaching the closest city hospital with medical oxygen, Sabita Reddy was dead. ""My mother kept us safe like an umbrella does, from the heat and rain of life,"" said Sonali Reddy, holding back tears. ""I imagine her being close to me. That's what keeps me going.""  Reddy and her siblings are among more than 3,000 Indian children who have been orphaned during the pandemic, according to state governments. They are a heart-rending testament to the devastation wrought on families as coronavirus erased hundreds of thousands of lives across the country. Even with all that has been lost, the orphans' plight has punctured the public consciousness, an acknowledgment of the profound challenges facing a country already full of vulnerable children. Indian states have announced compensation of about EUR 6 to EUR 57 per month for each orphan, along with promises of food and free education. Prime minister Narendra Modi vowed in a tweet to ""ensure a life of dignity and opportunity"" for the children. Neglect and exploitation But advocates fear that when the attention inevitably fades, the orphans will be left susceptible to neglect and exploitation. Already, the children, shellshocked in some cases from the loss of their entire families, have found it difficult to obtain death certificates to qualify for government benefits. Some will also find it hard to return to school. In the longer term, the many orphans from poor families in remote areas face the risk of human trafficking and child marriage. Trafficking of children is rampant in India, where they are enslaved for work or sex. And the country has the largest number of child brides in the world, according to Unicef. Adoption is not an option for many of the orphans, given cultural taboos against the practice. Older children, in particular, often cannot be matched with adoptive families.  ""The government is trying to save its face as the catastrophic tragedy ravaged India,"" said Medha Pande, a law student at Delhi University who has written about sociolegal issues arising from the pandemic. ""They came out looking unprepared,"" she said. ""They are just creating a subgroup out of a larger group of vulnerable children, saying they can easily look after them.""  On a recent morning, officials in the village of Pattapur, in Odisha state, arrived at Reddy's home, where her maternal grandmother moved in after her daughter's death. They had come to deliver an ""orphan pension"" to the children, enough money to last for the summer.  Bank accounts were opened in their names. The officials dropped off large bags of rice. Saucer-eyed, Reddy listened carefully as they rattled off a list of instructions for using her bank account. Her siblings - Jagabalia (8) and Bhabana (5) - looked on listlessly, clutching their sister's blue dress.  Even before her mother's death, the family had a meagre existence. Newly widowed, Sabita Reddy opened a small snack shop in the front room of their home. She spent what little money she had to provide after-school study for her oldest child. With her father gone, Sonali Reddy was especially close to her mother. ""My siblings beg me: 'We want to go to Mummy,'"" Reddy said as she fiddled with her thumbs. ""When our father passed away, we thought, 'At least mummy is there.' Now, the virus has taken her away too.""  Pleas Hundreds of  kilometres away in the southern city of Hyderabad, G Sathwik Reddy (13) - no relation to Sonali Reddy - hears similar pleas from his sister after their parents died during the peak of India's recent wave of infections.  When his sister, three-year-old Haanvi, asks for ""Mummy and Daddy"", he tells her simply, ""They will come home tomorrow."" Their father, Gopal Reddy, had a small business making iron fences for farms. Like millions of middle-class Indian families, they saved as much as they could to send their children to a private school. Their mother, Deepa Reddy, cooked special chicken dishes for her children every Sunday and helped Sathwik with his homework. In April, Gopal and Deepa and the children's grandmother contracted the virus within days of each other. With chronic oxygen shortages in India and hospitals turning away patients, the family worried about their chances.  Once at a hospital, Deepa became gravely ill. She remained intubated for two weeks, unconscious. Gopal's lungs, too, rapidly deteriorated.  By early May, all three were dead. At the crematory, Sathwik Reddy saw his father's face for a brief moment from behind a plastic sheet. He became numb with shock. Now, he often cries himself to sleep. ""I must stay strong for my sister,"" he said.  In the dusty plains of northern India, Shawez Saifi (18) finds himself sniffing back tears in the dark of night, when his sister jolts awake, screaming for their mother. Their parents, Shamshad and Shabnam Saifi, became sick in April, and Shawez took them to a local doctor, who recommended a coronavirus test. But with little money to go around from the dwindling work that father and son did on construction sites, Shabnam suggested they return to their home in Murad Nagar to recuperate. The children slept on the veranda outside their one-room shack while the parents locked themselves inside. After their condition quickly worsened, they moved to a relative's house. A few days later, Shabnam was dead. Her husband died a few days after that. When Shawez, who had given up his studies to work with his father, returned home without his parents, the landlord had locked them out, saying he would give them the key only after the rent was paid. His uncle borrowed money to cover some of the debt so that Shawez and his siblings could collect their belongings. Shawez's younger sister, Kahkashan (9), has been hit the hardest. Nearly every day, she picks up the phone and rings her mother, talking to her as if she were on the other end. ""Mother, when will you come? I miss you,"" she says.  Shawez said: ""My only dream is to educate my siblings. My mother would call me when I would be out for work and ask, 'Son, it is getting late. When will you come home?' Now no one will call me any more.""  In Pattapur, Sonali Reddy, too, feels as if she has lost her most powerful protector. In a thick diary, on the page next to the one on which she has noted the dates of her parents' deaths, Reddy jotted a poem dedicated to her mother. On a recent day, she read it aloud to her siblings:  ""Undergoing the ups and downs of life, Our mother brings us up. / Our mother is the tallest in this world, She is the one who can keep us well. / This world is barren without mother, This world is not the same place without her. / Mother bears the pain on our behalf, But we fail to bear the pain on mother's behalf. - New York Times"

His decision to install solar panels on the roof of a calving shed two years ago was financially motivated. The dairy farmer from Mullagh in Co Cavan milks 110 cows and was attracted to the idea by the opportunity to significantly reduce his electricity bill. After consulting with Pat Smith, of renewable energy company Local Power Ltd, he opted for PV solar panels. ""We ended up putting 30 panels on a calving shed. They produce around 9KW on a good day,"" Douglas explains. ""That's enough to power a cooler in a small milk tank all day."" Since the primary periods of electricity usage on the Kinkade farm are in the morning and evening during milking, it was decided to install batteries to store the power generated by the panels. Douglas describes the installation and wiring process for the panels as ""pretty simple"", with the work completed in two days, and there is very little ongoing maintenance. The full investment for the panels and the batteries was (EURO)20,000 but Douglas is confident that the savings generated will cover this cost in around four years. While the installation of solar panels is now covered under TAMS, these grants were not available to Douglas when he carried out the work. However, the investment did qualify for an accelerated capital allowance at the higher rate of tax, which effectively brought the capital cost down to around (EURO)10,000. Meanwhile, the solar panels have reduced Douglas's monthly electricity bill by around 25pc. ""This is roughly a saving of between (EURO)150 and (EURO)200 per month,"" he says. Looking to the future, Douglas would be open to installing more solar panels, if the capital investment was grant aided and farmers were paid a fair price for the electricity they feed into the grid.

By the end of it, I detested every brick. Even the thought of driving into that driveway,"" she shudders. ""It was nearly like a prison."" The five-bedroom house cost them some (EURO)700,000. ""We could afford it twice over,"" she says, of the payment on the mortgage that they originally secured from Bank of Scotland. ""It wasn't that we were taking a massive risk in the sense of what our earnings were compared to what the mortgage rates were going to be. We were total Celtic Tiger cubs. I always say that if there was a poster for the Celtic Tiger, we'd be on it. We thought the money trail was never going to end."" Instead, Ireland's property bubble left them more exposed than most to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, the worst slump since the Great Depression. ""It was so drastic,"" says Niamh, of the change in their circumstances, particularly following the government's bank guarantee scheme in September 2008. ""Oisín rang me, saying, 'The banks have pulled every single mortgage I have on the books and in the pipeline. They've closed the doors. They're not going to lend'."" Her first thought was that their savings would tide them over until things picked up in a few months. ""We could never have foreseen that this would go on for us for seven or eight years."" In 2007, the couple had earned over (EURO)100,000; in 2008, they earned (EURO)12,000. They couldn't pay their mortgage and the calls from the bank began. ""I understood the financial side of things, so I dealt with the banks and I didn't bury my head in the sand,"" says Oisín. ""I dealt with every call, every letter. I just contacted them continuously offering them money when I had money. We fought tooth and nail to keep that house for five years. It was coming at us for five years, losing the house. ""At the same time, we set up The Irish Fairy Door business so we thought we could save it. I was telling the banks all about that coming on stream. But to be honest, they probably heard so many stories from me that we were going to do this, we were going to that, we were going to be OK."" Their mortgage debt was sold on a number of times, including to loan-servicing groups Certus and Tanager, which the couple say compounded their stress. ""That was very tough, because you'd » » be just building a relationship with an individual and they would soften towards me,"" says Oisín. ""Then they'd just sell it on and you'd be bombarded again with letters, emails, phone calls. And you'd have to start all over again trying to build that relationship."" Niamh adds, of their various points of contact: ""They're not robots, they're humans. Oisín found a way to connect with each person that we dealt with. In the end, the girl who we actually handed the keys back to was crying for us."" It is possibly testament to Oisín's engagement with the various institutions that their case never went to court. But the threat of repossession was ever-present. ""It was like a train coming towards us on a train track,"" he says. The couple eventually decided to stop fighting and return the keys in 2014. ""The build-up towards losing the house was so hard to deal with that losing the house at the end, although it was horrendous, nearly came as a relief."" They were given four months to vacate. ""One day, Oisín was out at work and I had dropped the kids to school. When I came back there was a repossession order on the door. I remember it was yellow and it was really big. It said: 'This house has been repossessed' and the vacation date. I will never in all of my days forget it. I couldn't breathe,"" says Niamh. ""I wasn't worried that people would see it because anyone who knew us knew what was happening. It was just the coldness of it."" They were very fortunate to find a lovely rental home in nearby Tullyallen and a ""gorgeous, kind"" landlord. ""We told him our whole story - we didn't hold back, we didn't lie,"" says Oisín. ""We told him we'd lost our house. He said he wanted a family to go into it and he wanted to give us a new start. We could afford it because things were starting to pick up. When we lost the house, the irony of it all was things were starting to pick up for us because we had worked so hard through it, I suppose. Fairy Doors was starting to take off."" They founded the company in 2013 with an (EURO)8,500 loan from Niamh's mother. The following year they had a 97-second slot on The Late Late Toy Show and by 2015, they had 20 staffand sales in excess of (EURO)150,000. While their business took offand they were hailed as successful entrepreneurs, privately the picture was less rosy. ""Everyone knows the brand in Ireland and it was huge in America at one stage, and in the UK,"" says Niamh. ""Every red cent we had we pumped back in, but it gave us a wage. It hasn't made as much money as everyone thinks it has. People think, 'Oh, they must be minted' but we are far from it. It sounds corny to say it, but what it did give us was hope. I remember the Christmas of 2013 we were able to do our own shopping. We didn't have to rely on our parents as much."" Though Niamh and Oisín still have a shareholding in it, their ownership of the The Irish Fairy Door Company has ""been diluted down over the past number of years"". Niamh explains: ""It needed the investment because we got tied into an agreement for a cartoon series a couple of years ago that unfortunately stalled the whole business. It had a huge negative effect because it was just taking too long. Then, obviously, Covid-19 hit."" The company moved to a licensing model, which meant changes to supply chain, staffing and sales and marketing models that led to a contributing loss of (EURO)422,011 in 2019. But the pilot light of that original hope still flickers. Plans are afoot to launch interactive fairy trails, which will allow you to ""hold your phone up to fairy doors in, say, a town, a woodland or a park"" to 'see' inside. ""We're still there, we haven't gone anywhere, and when it comes to new products and new ideas, it's all about to kick offagain,"" says Niamh. Throughout those early years in the Fairy Door business, Oisín, a serial entrepreneur who bought his first home aged 21, was obsessed with the goal of buying another house after the repossession. Niamh adds: ""I think anyone who is in a rental situation knows, at the end of the day, you're one month away from [potentially] having to find somewhere different."" Realising the couple's mortgage chances would be better if he wasn't self-employed, Oisín took a job at Dublin brand experience company Nineyards, working his way up to chief operating officer. In March of this year, much to the couple's delight, they got mortgage approval. Was it difficult to secure, given their history? ""Yeah, is the blunt answer,"" says Oisín. ""The banks are not very forgiving. I don't know what is wrong with this country that they don't forgive and let people start again like they do in other countries. I don't know whether it is inherent in our culture or what it is."" The Irish Credit Bureau holds information about borrowers and their loans for five years after the loan is closed. ""My credit bureau is clear, so when you do a check against my name and Niamh's name, everything is right, because it takes five years for it to come offthe Credit Bureau."" Once their mortgage approval came through, the couple wasted no time in searching for a property to buy. But as anyone who is house hunting right now knows, it's a sparse market. Then they remembered that one of their neighbours had put her house on the market briefly before the pandemic. ""Niamh had the neck on her to go over and knock on the door of the house and say, 'Are you still interested in selling?'"" says Oisín. ""And they said yes. We did a private deal on it."" The house cost less than half the price of their Celtic Tiger home, and they borrowed 80pc - the maximum they could apply for. ""It is an average house price. I really did not want to put any stress on us going forward, as we had to be able to afford it no matter what. It is cheaper than our rent, so I felt we would be able to afford it going forward."" Less than six weeks later, they had the keys. Throughout their struggles, the couple shielded their young children from what was happening. ""That was my sole aim,"" says Niamh, emphatically. ""Oisín wanted to get us through financially; I wanted to protect them."" When Niamh explained her excitement at owning a house after losing their last one, her son Cian exclaimed, ""We lost that house? No way!"" ""The trauma for Cian was when we had to get the dogs rehomed,"" says Oisín. ""I think that was worse than losing the house, even for me."" One of their two dogs had been repeatedly sick, costing (EURO)900 at the vet each time. It was only when her card was declined buying food in Lidl that Niamh agreed they had to go. Drogheda Animal Rescue rehomed them together, which was a comfort. After saying goodbye to their pets: ""We sat in the utility room where they'd slept and we cried and we cried. That was definitely one of the lowest points,"" says Niamh. She has had ""a lot of therapy"" to deal with those years and is grateful that she and Oisín could tag team the bad days and were rarely despondent at the same time. ""When you feel like you're drowning and you can hold on to somebody, that helps. But when you both feel like you're drowning, it just feels so hopeless."" She has experienced a lot of healing too, she says, not least when the family welcomed a cockapoo pup called Cooper - after Dublin footballer Jonny Cooper - late last year. Another source of joy was their neighbours in the estate helping them to move across the green. ""They were absolutely brilliant. There was a stream of people coming back and forth, carrying things across, bringing wheelbarrows,"" says Oisín, and the couple has had ""unbelievable support"" from family and friends throughout the years too. They will welcome them into their ""lovely, south-facing garden"" later in the summer ""when we are all vaccinated"". There will be ""loads of food, loads to drink and loads of kids and loads of everything"". In the meantime, Niamh and Oisín particularly enjoy chilling out on the recently purchased reclining sofa in their new home. ""We're on either side, and the bowl of popcorn between us. It's the best feeling in the entire world. If you could bottle it, I tell you, you'd be a millionaire,"" Niamh smiles, and Oisín agrees. ""I don't think we ever thought we'd get here, I really don't,"" she adds. ""We always hoped. But to actually be here and to be able to close the door… Nothing is temporary any more. There are no words for how we feel. It's just incredible."" l See www.nineyards.ie I always say that if there was a poster for the Celtic Tiger, we'd be on it.

19,19,/home/paultrust/Downloads/Files(415)/'There was a big yellow notice on our door. It said_ this house is being repossessed';Despite their.DOCX,The Irish Times,2021-07-10,2857 words,SATURDAY MAGAZINE; Pg. 13,Cathal Dennehy,NA,"'They're always the loudest in the stadium'; Ireland's Olympic and Paralympic athletes are headed for Japan, but this yeartheir families and friends must stay at home, writes Cathal Dennehy",FALSE,"After all the doubt, the will-it-won't-it anxiety, Ireland's Olympic and Paralympic athletes can rest easy knowing one thing is certain: the Games are set to begin.  The procedures that will allow the greatest show on Earth to go ahead are as strict as you might imagine, with athletes told to eat alone, refrain from talking in confined spaces and forced to undergo daily testing for Covid-19 - concessions they're happy to make to reach the sporting pinnacle. While the action now looks likely to take place in front of a very limited local crowd, or none at all, the decision earlier this year to ban foreign spectators means there's one big difference for members of Team Ireland: when they step into the ring or out on the track, they won't see or hear their usual supporting cast in the stands.  Most athletes have already departed for Japan, hugging their families goodbye in recent days, and the next time they meet, their dreams could be shattered into pieces or have finally come true. We caught up with five athletes and their loved ones as the biggest festival in sport prepares for ignition.   Chloe Watkins (Hockey) Before her daughter takes off for Japan, and again after she arrives, Chloe Watkins' mother Pascal will say a prayer. ""Please God, let them walk out and let it happen for them,"" she says. ""Let them all be safe and sound."" For her, as for so many parents, this is a nervous time. No matter how grown up their offspring may be, how accomplished in the elite echelons of sport, the stress of being a parent never goes away. But the biggest emotion they feel right now is something different - pride. ""You realise the effort they put in,"" says Pascal. ""Their life really goes on hold to compete at that level. For Chloe to have that mettle and determination to stick with it, that's what I'm proud of. She certainly didn't get any of that from me."" It's a point Chloe herself would dispute. The 29-year-old Dubliner has been a key cog in the wheel of the Irish women's hockey team for over a decade, and she knows none of the success she enjoyed would have happened were it not for her family's obsession with the sport.  Her father Gordon and brother Gareth were both internationals while sister Courtney has been a long-time stalwart for Hermes-Monkstown. Chloe's mother didn't have a hockey background but she was always there, supporting, encouraging, and over the years she has developed an in-depth knowledge of the sport's intricacies.  ""They understand the game, the emotions of it,"" says Chloe. ""You can have honest conversations with them. I hate being told you did great when you didn't and I don't want to be blown up if I had a bad game."" Her parents typically travel to every international tournament, no matter how far flung, and they had everything in place to be in Tokyo last year until the Games were postponed. Now that they're unable to travel at all, Chloe knows it won't quite feel the same.  ""You can get the arm around you if you need it or the boot up the arse if you need it - that's the part we're going to miss most,"" she says. ""Anytime we're in the fourth quarter and feeling tired, it's always so nice to look up and [see] the green. It spurs you on. They're always the loudest in the stadium so it'll be a shame not to have them."" Her mother would love to gather with others at Monkstown Hockey Club to watch the games but says they will ""go with what public health tells us we can do"", which will likely mean watching at home with just the family.  Over the past few weeks, Chloe and her team-mates have been travelling to Belfast to spend time in a heat chamber, cranking workouts on a stationary bike at 35-38 degrees, preparing them for what's ahead in Tokyo. ""We know it's a huge deal, the first time ever an Irish women's hockey team has made it, so we want to put our best foot forward,"" she says. ""We're so, so excited."" That feeling will be replicated almost 10,000km away in Dublin, as her mother sits down to watch a family dream finally come to fruition.  ""The Olympic games, it's the pinnacle and I'm very proud she had the fortitude to stay with it and that it's happening,"" says Pascal. ""It's actually happening.""   Barry McClements (Swimming) For so many years, through the central vein of his youth, the routine was the same: Barry McClements would wake up at 4am and hop into a car with his father, also Barry, by 5am, the pair making the 20-minute journey to the pool in Newtownards, Co Down. He'd train until 7.30am, then get ready for school at 9am. Once that was done he was back to the pool again and - smack-bang in the middle of his adolescence - bedtime was no later than 8.30pm.  All of that, for this: a shot at his first Paralympics. The 19-year-old swimmer is set to compete in the 100m butterfly, 100m backstroke, 200m individual medley and 400m freestyle in Tokyo next month. McClements competes in the S9 category as his right leg was amputated above the knee when he was a 10-month-old baby, owing to a rare birth defect called fibular hemimelia. As a child, he found in swimming a sport where his disability mattered little, and it's been his obsession ever since.  ""His work ethic is very, very strong, especially for a young lad,"" says his father. ""He's very level-headed, humble, but he wants to achieve so much. His time will come, but it's about patience. Tokyo is a stepping stone."" The teenager's main goal is to beat his personal bests and he says ""whatever comes with that is an extra, whether that's a final or a medal."" At the age of 14, he just missed out on the 2016 Rio Games by two seconds, an agonising measure in a 400m race.  His dream was deferred but not yet denied.  His family had hoped to be in Tokyo, with his dad weighing up the exorbitant cost last year before the decision was finally taken out of their hands. They now plan to invite friends and relatives to their home in Comber, Co Down, host some late-summer barbecues and burn the midnight oil as they gather around a TV, screaming their support. ""We'll try to make it as special as possible,"" says Barry snr. ""We'll video it and send it to him.""  Having been there for every step of his son's journey, he believes few truly appreciate the commitment required for athletes who represent their country on the global stage.  ""Every one of them, even those who didn't get qualifying times, deserves a standing ovation,"" he says. ""They're young guys giving so much for their dreams. Their friends are going out and enjoying themselves and they're having to go to bed at 8 o'clock. I couldn't have done it."" Having travelled far and wide to watch his son compete, it'll feel odd not to be there on his biggest day, but Barry snr knows these Games, more than any, are not about the supporting cast.  ""It's all for the athletes,"" he says. ""For them to be able to compete is what's important. They worked their socks off."" But Barry jnr knows it's not just about him. When he gets on those starting blocks in Tokyo next month and looks at that lane stretched out in front of him, he'll be fully aware how many have helped him to make it there.  ""Recently I've realised it wasn't just me who made sacrifices,"" he says. ""My family did too. It's about going out there and making them proud."" Greta Streimikyte (Athletics) Having your family there on the biggest day of your career can be a double-edged sword. When things go well, it's glorious, the tears of joy flowing and a lifetime of golden memories banked for all concerned. But when things go wrong, the athlete can experience guilt, the effort, energy and economic investment by loved ones heightening their sense of failure. Greta Streimikyte has experienced both sides. The 25-year-old Paralympian is a 1,500-metre specialist who competes in the T13 category, for those with a moderate visual impairment, and she finished a fine fourth at the 2016 Games in Rio. But at the World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai three years later, she expected to win a medal and fell short. The first meeting with her parents after the race was a tough one.  ""I told them, 'I need some space,'"" she recalls. ""'Mom, I love you but I have to go.' When things go wrong, I like to take my 10 minutes because as an athlete, you feel guilty if things don't go your way."" But Streimikyte knows their support is unconditional, and it extends right through her family. She is a triplet and is as close to sister Emilija and brother Arnas as you'd expect. The feeling is mutual. ""If I have a chance, I'm always there to support her,"" says Arnas. ""She's very focused, very disciplined in what she's doing. Whether it's college or sport, she always puts in 110 per cent. If she falls down, gets injured, she always gets back up. It's just who she is."" The whole family hoped to be in Tokyo but now they will likely gather at home in Bettystown, Co Meath, to watch her races. Ever since Greta smashed her 1,500m personal best last month, clocking 4:29.33, her brother has believed she will return with a medal. ""I expect her to get at least third place,"" he says. Greta grew up in Vilnius, Lithuania, moving to Ireland at the age of 15 to live with her father, who had relocated here in 2006 for work. She gained Irish citizenship in 2016 and since then has proudly worn the green at championships across the globe. Coached by Feidhlim Kelly, she has ascended to a new level over the past year, training alongside Olympic team members such as Michelle Finn, Andrew Coscoran and Mark English at the Dublin Track Club.  ""We all do the work, we have our coffees after and have the craic,"" she says. ""That sense of community is important. When I joined I was very inspired. Everyone was about being the best we can be."" Although this will be a heavily restricted Games, she doesn't feel she'll miss out given she had the typical Paralympics experience in Rio. ""The main point for me is I'm there to compete and to race,"" she says.  When the Paralympics get under way on August 24th, she'll certainly miss having her family in the stands, but Streimikyte will nonetheless give it everything. Their absence could even work in her favour, lessening any sense of pressure as she toes the line.  ""The goal is to perform as best as I can and to have no regrets,"" she says. ""If I can do that, whatever comes out of it is a bonus."" Emmet Brennan (Boxing) On the night he qualified for Tokyo, Emmet Brennan's mother Bernie was pacing through Fairview Park on the north side of Dublin. It's what she always does when he fights, feeling it's a bad luck omen to tune in, knowing she'd experience a level of anxiety she could really do without. ""I do anything just to avoid it,"" she says.  And so that Monday night in early June, she and her daughter Caoimhe left their home in North Strand, where the rest of the family had gathered to watch the 30-year-old Dubliner's key qualifying bout in Paris. It was a close fight, with four judges ruling it a 28-28 draw, but the fifth gave it to Brennan, 29-27. Seconds later, the call came through from Bernie's other daughter, Christine.  Emmet was going to the Olympics.  ""We were running up and down, with people looking at us wondering, 'What's wrong with them?'"" recalls Bernie. ""We were crying, throwing our arms around one another, then we had to try run home."" Meanwhile, Emmet's father, Christy, had retreated to the backyard.  ""As soon as his hand went up it was euphoria, the whole place went crazy,"" says Christy. ""There was nobody in the backyard but I was just screaming. My other son was bawling his eyes out, my daughter didn't know where she was. It was absolutely brilliant."" Before the pandemic, Christy had gone to almost all of Emmet's fights, both at home and abroad. The family all planned to be in Tokyo, along with about a dozen of Emmet's friends, but the light-heavyweight boxer now has to go it alone.  ""It won't change anything in terms of performance, but it'll change the experience,"" says Emmet. ""I would have loved to experience it with my family, to have them all out there."" Nonetheless, he'll soak up what he can, a dream realised that had once seemed so unlikely. To get to this point, Brennan had to take a punt on his ability. In 2019, he was one of a horde of Irish light-heavyweights with the potential to make the Games but he knew it would require full-time commitment.  He was flat broke so he took a loan from the credit union, living at home with his parents where his mother did the cooking and laundry, his father the de facto taxi driver.  ""Other people had grants, he didn't have anything,"" says Christy. ""To go through all that and come through was amazing."" It had been a tough period for the family, with Christy suffering a major heart attack last year. ""He probably shouldn't be here but he is and he's after turning his life around,"" says Emmet. ""He lost four or five stone, he's out exercising, so I want to dedicate getting to the Olympics to him and the rest of my family for pulling around."" Emmet is also quick to credit the influence of his brother, Greg. ""He gives me constant encouragement, constant motivation, he always has my back. His two sons, Ollie and Harry, are part of the reason I do this. I want to be a good role model for them."" When he stepped out of the ring in Paris after securing qualification, Emmet called them all immediately on Zoom and saw just what it meant. ""I was incredibly proud, more for them because I repaid the faith they put into me,"" he says. ""I wouldn't be boxing if it wasn't for them."" But now that he's made it to Tokyo, he has realigned his ambitions. He wants a medal.  ""I'm not naive, it's going to be a very, very tough task,"" he says. ""You're going to have to be on your A-game every single fight, but I'm looking to go all the way and get a medal."" Back in Dublin, his mother will have to make those same nervous walks in the witching hours, given the eight-hour difference with Tokyo, while his father and siblings will again be planted in the livingroom. They'll be on the other side of the world yet they'll also be right there with Emmet for every bob and weave, every duck and jab. ""I'm so proud,"" says Christy. ""Really, so proud.""  Thomas Barr (Athletics) One of the big things he'll miss is the post-race meeting. At just about every championship he's been to, Thomas Barr walks off the track, gathers his gear, and the first call he makes is to his parents, Tommy and Martina.  Usually they'll be roaming around outside the stadium, trying to co-ordinate a meeting point, and no matter how the race went they're the two people Barr wants to see first.  ""It'll be really strange not to have that in Tokyo,"" he says. ""Whether it goes good or bad, it's always nice to have my mum or dad there to comfort or celebrate after the rounds."" They were there at the Rio Games in 2016, the entire family enjoying a dizzying whirlwind adventure as Barr ran the three best races of his life in four days, becoming the first Irish athlete in 84 years to reach an Olympic sprint final. He finished fourth in the 400m hurdles, just one 20th of a second outside the medals.  ""Rio was wonderful,"" says Martina. ""It's something Tommy or myself will never forget. The night of the semi-final [which Thomas won] we were at the very top in the stands, nobody around us, and we were wildly excited. That's why it's a shame we won't experience it again. We hadn't a clue what was going on at home when we were in Rio, it was only when we came home we realised the buzz it created."" Martina is typically a nervous wreck when her son races, a feeling she expects to be heightened when she's forced to watch the action in Tokyo from her home in Dunmore East, Waterford.  ""I hate watching him on a screen,"" she says. ""When you're out there you get caught up in the whole thing - I'm still an idiot when we're sitting in the stands - but I don't know how it'll be watching on TV. I know one thing: I want it to be just our own family so we can stress and react any way we need to."" Thomas won't be alone in terms of family support, though, as his sister Jessie - an Olympian herself in 2012 - will be there as a Team Ireland psychologist.  ""We're delighted about that,"" says Martina. ""It's reassuring."" Thomas's parents were both booked to travel to Tokyo before the Games were postponed, and they held out hope for much of 2021 they might still make it. ""Gutted,"" says Martina of the decision in March to ban foreign spectators. ""Not to be there for the Olympics, we're sickened. But on the other side, we're just glad they're going ahead."" Thomas will feel their absence, but his disappointment is more for them than for him. ""I'm hoping they'll get just as much out of it for themselves watching at home,"" he says. ""I'll miss them, but I'm glad it's going ahead as it is."" The usual Olympic experience will inevitably be diluted, with little interaction between athletes and plexiglass screens between them in the dining hall. But beyond all that, Barr knows the magic of the Games will remain. ""It's the biggest stage of sport,"" he says. ""Because such a small percentage of athletes, let alone people, get to make it, it has that prestige. It captures the imagination and attention of the entire world."""

Nervous days for the Government. It would love nothing more than to throw open the doors for everyone to drink, dine, dance and do whatever they used to do before the shutters came down. Ministers and backbenchers are getting it in the neck all year from angry lobby groups and cheesed-off constituents, and they hate it. Enforcing Covid-19 restrictions is a continuing nightmare for politicians desperate to be in the good news business. But, argue the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, what is the alternative? ""How long have you got?"" chorus the Opposition.  But now, after what seems like forever, pubs and restaurants (no news of the other weakened Irish businesses overlooked because they don't sell drink) are on course to pick up the pieces by July 26th at the latest as the Coalition goes hell for leather down the road to reopening. Even the famously raucous seagulls of Leinster House are drowned out by the sounds of feverish hammering coming from Government Buildings. And an evolving plan has been produced. It involves awarding a EU Digital Covid Certificate or Tony Ticket to fully vaccinated people or those who have recovered from Covid-19 in the past six months. This golden certificate to indoor carousing will be required to get entry to establishments. How the system will work is still a bit hazy. While a Tony Ticket carries the imprimatur of the chief medical officer (the Government wouldn't issue it otherwise), there won't be a fancy Holohan hologram on it or anything like that. It can be emailed to the holder or posted out and then printed or photographed or saved onto your phone or screen-printed onto a T-shirt or written in biro on your arm. Certain proofs are needed to get your hands on a coveted Tony Ticket, although it seems the requirements are flexible.  People who have recovered from the infection are subject to a 180-day Lazarus clause which means they will no longer be covered by the certificate after that period. And then there is the very important part that GPs might or might not play in assisting the rollout, once the confusion over identifying the formerly infectious goes away. Categories of cert There are also different categories of cert. This set the tone of befuddlement  yesterday morning when Minister for Tourism and Light Entertainment Catherine Martin said on radio that family doctors would be drafting letters to confirm patients had tested positive for Covid-19. ""News to us,"" roared the exhausted GPs of Ireland, affronted by this sudden imposition without as much as a courtesy phone call to their representative body.  The junior Minister at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Catherine's Green Party colleague, Ossian Smyth, was rapidly rolled out on the next radio programme to clear up the ""misunderstanding"". The doctors will not be dispatching reverse sick notes after all. ""I will be issuing the recovery certificates,"" announced Ossian, who is an IT specialist. ""If anyone has tested positive, they should not involve their GP."" Then the Minister for Light Entertainment issued a clarification some time later. It was just a little mix-up over a memo. She had been talking about the European travel certificate and not the Tony Ticket for indoor gallivanting. ""News to us,"" roared the GPs again, refusing to open their notepads in protest. And there the matter stands, or wobbles.  At least the Opposition was delighted to see things going so well and promising signs of light at the end of the tunnel. ""A really crazy situation,"" railed Paul Murphy from the Leinster House plinth. ""Flawed. It's a mess. A complete mess,"" wailed Alan Kelly, also from the plinth, before heading across the Liffey to repeat himself. ""Discriminatory and unenforceable,"" cried Mary Lou McDonald, continuing the theme when the Dáil commenced its last week before the summer break.  Under fire for his Government's efforts to get business going again in the indoor hospitality sector after nearly two years of lost trade, the Taoiseach was losing patience. He put it up to the majority of Opposition TDs who have been calling for the reopening. What do they want him to do now? ""We can decide not to open indoor hospitality at all if that's what people want us to do, please articulate it."" Speaking of articulation, Mattie McGrath might want to see the pubs of rural Ireland open again but not if unvaccinated people are going to be barred from going inside. His Rural Independent Group compadre, Michael Healy-Rae agreed. ""I certainly wouldn't be telling you my medical records,"" he said earlier when his group outlined their opposition to the Bill on the plinth, as if bouncers on pub doors will be demanding confidential details of surgical procedures or sexual health history.  Vaccinated  ""My body, my choice,"" declared Mattie, declining to say whether or not he has been vaccinated and, in the process, gladdening the hearts of Repeal campaigners by finally accepting the basic tenet of their argument that it is a woman's right to choose on abortion. And fair enough, it is Mattie's choice to decide whether or not to be vaccinated in the interests of public health and his choice to remain outside the door of a pub. ""Is that what we've come to now? Are we back to 1933 in Germany? We'll be all tagged, and the yellow and the mark of the beast on us. Is that where we're going?"" he ranted. Because not getting into a pub without being vaccinated to protect yourself and the people around you from harm is tantamount to the worst abominations of Nazi Germany."" In the Dáil, the Taoiseach, not the first time, took McGrath to task over his references to totalitarianism. It's not on. Look up the history. ""Do you understand what the Holocaust was about?"" And Mattie howled in protest. He never said the ""H"" word, forgetting what he said earlier on the plinth.  Meanwhile, there was a warm welcome for new TD, Ivana Bacik. She entered the chamber for the first time at 2pm. By 3pm, and Mattie's latest outburst among other rows, we hear she was seeking repatriation to the Seanad."

Catherine Duggan yesterday settled a High Court action against the HSE over her husband Liam's treatment in hospital. The health service apologised to her and their two young children and paid what has been described as a 'substantial sum' to them. Mr Duggan, who ran golfing schools for children, fell ill on March 17, 2017, and went to University Hospital Kerry the following day with vomiting and diarrhoea. ""He was discharged on April 3 with the HSE admitting there was a breach of care in a failure to perform a repeat abdominal CT scan to investigate Mr Duggan's condition before his discharge from hospital,"" Rachael O'Shaughnessy, the Duggans' solicitor, said. ""Nine days later, on April 12, Liam was once again admitted via the A&E of the University Hospital Kerry with abdominal pain, vomiting with diarrhoea, high temperature, high pulse and clear evidence of sepsis. ""He was gravely ill and was transferred to Cork University Hospital two days later. Sadly, Liam's condition deteriorated further and he tragically passed away on May 9 at just 37 years of age."" At an inquest the cause of his death was given as multiple organ failure due to septic shock due to colitis. A verdict of death by natural causes was recorded. Yesterday Mrs Duggan described her late husband as ""wonderful man, husband and father who endeared himself to everyone he encountered in life, schools, teachers, parents and students alike"". She said ""the whole system and ordeal of having to face an inquest"" has been ""utterly devastating for me and my children"". ""We have had to fight tooth and nail to bring justice for Liam who should have been in the prime of his life."" The couple's children Jack and Amelia were aged three and one at the time of his death. ""The tragic loss of Jack and Amelia's dad at such an early age, especially when that loss should not have happened, left both children shattered,"" Mrs Duggan said. ""Children should not have to face a tragedy like this. Liam adored Jack and Amelia. He was such a family man who was loved so much. His life revolved around both of them. ""We have fought hard the last four years to get to today. Jack and Amelia have been given a letter of apology from the HSE for their actions. ""The HSE's mistakes have had a life-changing effect on Liam's family and friends who hopefully after today can get some peace from this decision and bring closure to them. After a four-year legal battle I hope that Liam gets to rest in peace. ""I hope by bringing awareness today that it might save someone else's life."" Asked if the family would wish to see a second inquest, Ms O'Shaughnessy said it was a possibility in the future they would not rule out. Mr Duggan, who was a PGA advanced golf professional, was posthumously awarded the President's Award for golf development in 2017 for developing the sport in schools and promoting inclusivity. Mrs Duggan thanked her ""wonderful family and friends"" who had stuck by her for their family's ordeal for the last four years. Ms O'Shaughnessy said she first met Mrs Duggan when she was recently widowed and her determination to get answers during what had been an uphill battle was an inspiration. ""Catherine has been relentless in her quest to find out what happened to her husband Liam,"" the solicitor said. ""It is as a result of Catherine's bravery and conviction and asking the right questions on behalf of her husband, herself and her children that I believe we are standing here today. ""It is so desperately sad that two young children have been left without a father, Catherine without a loving husband and a local community without an immense talent.""

Thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades. They chanted ""freedom"" and called for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down. ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" Mr Biden said. The protests erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, its old ally, and more recently a record surge in coronavirus infections, with people denouncing shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the pandemic. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights. Those rights, including the right of peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future, must be respected,"" Mr Biden said. ""The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than enriching themselves."" Shortly before Mr Biden issued his statement, Mr Diaz-Canel yesterday blamed US sanctions, which were tightened in recent years, for economic woes such as medicine shortages and power outages that fuelled the protests at the weekend. In what were regarded as the largest-scale demonstrations in decades, thousands of people chanting ""freedom"" and ""yes, we can"" took to the streets from Havana to Santiago de Cuba in a major new challenge to an authoritarian government struggling to cope with increasingly severe blackouts, food shortages and a spiking coronavirus outbreak. The protests, from Havana's famous Malecon to small towns and the island nation's eastern cities, spoke to the power of social media, as well as discontent that has bubbled to the surface in the worsening pandemic, during which Cuba has already witnessed growing political protests led by artists and musicians. The protests apparently started in the city of San Antonio de los Baños and spread rapidly as demonstrators shared their protests on Facebook Live. The demonstrations were so large that Mr Diaz-Canel, who succeeded Raúl Castro this year as first secretary of the Communist Party, called on Cuba's ""revolutionary"" citizens to take to the streets. ""We are prepared to do anything,"" he said in a national address. ""We will be battling in the streets."" He blamed the United States for agitating the population. Witnesses said Cuban security personnel deployed tear gas and other forms of force to disperse crowds, using vehicles to detain dozens of people. There were reports of multiple people wounded, as security forces and pro-government counterdemonstrators clashed with protesters. ""I have never seen such a protest in my life,"" Noel Alonso Ginoris (26), a writer and member of Havana's San Isidro artists movement who has sought to challenge government authority, said. He joined the protests in Havana at around 1pm on Sunday after seeing videos of demonstrations across the island. In central Havana, he said he saw a clash between protesters and about 50 pro-government demonstrators who were being guarded by police. ""That's when things got tense and violent,"" he said. The two groups, he said, started confronting each other until the police intervened. ""Everyone started running; it was like a movie scene,"" he said. ""I saw one man very close to me, an older man in a blue pullover. They threw him to the ground, tied his hands and arrested him because he shouted 'Freedom'."" José Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division, said his group had received reports that at least 20 people had been arrested. ""This is pretty massive,"" he said. ""My sense is that this is a combination of social unrest based on a lack of freedoms, and Covid, and economic conditions. ""The lack of access to electricity. The blackouts.

The British entrepreneur touched down safely in New Mexico after a hair-raising flight with his company Virgin Galactic that briefly took him and three fellow passengers beyond the reach of Earth's gravity. The spacecraft, called the VSS Unity, detached from a carrier airplane at 50,000ft and fired a hybrid rocket engine to blast up to 85,000ft, above what the United States defines as the edge of space. It was a landmark moment for Virgin Galactic's 17-year attempt to make commercial space tourism a reality, giving future customers a demonstration that its vehicle works after previously suffering fatal accidents. It was also a blow to Mr Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world's richest person, who has scheduled his own launch with his space company Blue Origin for July 20. In a ceremony after landing, Mr Branson (70) accepted a pair of astronaut's wings and hailed his flight as ""the experience of a lifetime"". He said: ""What a day, what a day. I think like most kids I have dreamt of this moment since I was a kid, and honestly nothing can prepare you for the view of Earth from space. ""Suddenly you're looking down and seeing people looking up at you - hang on, what are you doing down there? I'm just taking it all in, it's unreal. ""My mission was to turn the dream of space travel into a reality for my grandchildren, for your grandchildren, for many people who are alive today, for everybody. And having flown to space, I have seen how Virgin Galactic is the space line for Earth. ""We're here to make space accessible to all, and we want to turn the next generation of dreamers into the astronauts of today and tomorrow."" ""That was an amazing accomplishment,"" former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, a onetime commander of the International Space Station, said from the sidelines. ""I'm just so delighted at what this open door is going to lead to now. It's a great moment."" Starting at 4am local time, around 500 people gathered at a spaceport near the town of Truth or Consequences to see the launch. Camera crews and staff bustled as a master of ceremonies tried to hype up the crowd, creating an atmosphere more reminiscent of a cruise ship disco than a grave scientific milestone. The mothership, named Eve after Mr Branson's mother, took off quietly and without much ceremony, save for silence from the crowd as it accelerated and cheers when it left the ground. But when Unity detached from Eve and began its rocket burn, it was easily visible from the ground as a sudden streak of white smoke climbing rapidly into the deep sky. Mr Branson attempted to address the crowd from space, but the audio link broke. Then Unity's ""feathering"" stage - in which its twin tails swing upwards from the craft's body at a 60 degree angle to create drag and help it drift down to Earth - deployed safely, avoiding a replay of the 2014 accident that tore its sister ship Enterprise into pieces. After a brief glide back to Earth, Unity rolled to a stop and Mr Branson alighted to hug and kiss his wife and children. The journey after detaching from Eve took less than 15 minutes. Mr Bezos sent his congratulations, adding: ""Can't wait to join the club!"" - though he also took to Twitter a couple of days earlier to enumerate the ways in which be believes his company's tourist rides will be better than Virgin Galactic. Blue Origin had previously blasted Virgin for only breaking the US-defined boundary of space, which is lower than many other countries', claiming that Mr Branson would have ""an asterisk next to [his] name"" on any list of real astronauts. Mr Branson's other chief rival in the space-tourism race among the world's richest men, SPACEX's Elon Musk, came to New Mexico to watch and congratulated Mr Branson for a ""beautiful flight."" With his ""Willy Wonka hat on"", the British tycoon also announced a competition to win two seats on a Virgin Galactic flight next year. A winner will be announced in September. Virgin has about 600 ticketholders who have been waiting for their seat since before 2014 and paid between $200,000 and $250,000. Analysts have estimated future tickets will cost about $400,000.

I Rechristened as the (EURO)80bn company's ""joint headquarters"", co-founders Patrick and John Collison say that over 1,000 new jobs are coming. One reason is that it is starting to design and build full global products from Dublin. This is a rare thing among tech multinationals here. The first big one is Stripe Tax, which calculates sales tax or Vat for dozens of countries, including internally in 50 US states or different Australian states. This, Stripe says, was one of its customers' most-requested features. Will we see more of this globally influential stuff from Ireland? ""I think the answer is yes,"" says one of the company's most senior engineers and its Emea business lead, Matt Henderson. ""You'll see more products that are built, from start to finish, from Europe and in particular from our largest hub in Dublin."" Is it right to consider this as a big deal? ""You might say that it's a big deal but it's consistent with us being an Irish-American company and Dublin being one of our two headquarters,"" he says. ""We're now at a point where we've grown to more than 80 engineers in the Dublin hub already and it's still growing very, very fast. The team in Ireland has also been driving country expansion for Stripe in the region. We've launched in 13 countries. So quite a high proportion of Stripe's worldwide country expansion has come out of the same [Dublin] team."" The underlying figures give more context to why Stripe is investing heavily in its Irish and European operations. According to the company's most recent accounts, Stripe's revenue grew 51pc in Europe and Asia before the Covid outbreak. It saw an increase in turnover in Europe and Asia from $529m ((EURO)440m) to $800m in 2019. Stripe International also recorded an after-tax profit of $39m for the first time, compared to a loss of $24m the year before, because of a oneoff internal group IP transfer worth $150m. The accounts also show that the Collisons transferred all of Stripe's international intellectual property to Ireland in 2019, the year it established Dublin as its international headquarters, in a transfer valued at $10.95bn. Since then, CEO Patrick Collison has described Stripe as an ""Irish American"" company with an increasing number of leadership executive roles based in Dublin, where over 300 people are employed. to more engineers in hub' In March, Stripe announced that it would add ""at least"" 1,000 jobs in Dublin over the next five years as it ""doubles down"" on Ireland as an international headquarters. Co-founder John Collison said that Europe, which is Stripe's second-largest market behind the US, is a growing percentage of Stripe's business and that investment here was one of the reasons Stripe raised a fresh $600m in private funding this year. ""If you're a merchant anywhere using Stripe and you're selling into a customer who's in France or the UK or Ireland and using a particular local payment method, you'll likely utilise features that are built by these teams in Ireland,"" says Mr Henderson. ""They work on a combination of features for our global payments network. Each feature will typically be something that is particularly important for this region, but nevertheless it functions worldwide. This [Stripe Tax] is the first example of a product that has been done from start to finish by European team."" The company says that it will continue to build out its global payments and treasury network this year, expanding its software and services. Stripe will also soon be available to more businesses in Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand and the UAE. ""We're very bullish about the talent in Ireland,"" says Mr Henderson. ""As a result, we're expanding the office here a lot. We'll continue to do so over the coming years. ""You will continue to see a lot of the engineering, investment in payments networks, geographic expansion and just more depth in terms of performance and capabilities,"" he added. Stripe processes payments in 42 countries for customers such as Deliveroo, N26, Intercom and Donedeal. Earlier this year, it announced the rollout of card-issuing service for businesses in 20 European countries, including Ireland. Around 14pc of commerce takes place online today as the global economy accelerates its shift to online in 2020. Stripe says that its mission is to ""grow the GDP of the internet, making it easy for ambitious companies everywhere to grow their business"". The Stripe Tax feature works by matching a customer's location with the product or service being sold. It then figures out what the correct sales tax should be before applying it. It will also validate VAT IDs for European customers, applying a reverse charge or zero VAT rate when required. The feature will be charged on a percentage basis, based on when it is used. ""The idea of doing it was more of a screaming need rather than a brainstorm,"" said Mr Henderson. ""We started working on it in earnest in Ireland about 18 months ago. We talked to users and then started to build it. Four the last six months, we've had some pilot users. testing it on real transactions.' ""We're more confident now not only about the growth of the internet economy but the impact that we're having on businesses and how they're using Stripe to expand globally,"" he says.

It was, they said, to acknowledge that due to the Covid pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, people had been out driving less, so presumably fewer accidents and claims had been made. Looking out the window at our car parked in front of the house, I tried to remember the last time we'd used it. It might have been a couple of weeks earlier, on a trip to Aldi to stock up on cupboard staples. For day-to-day essentials, we were walking to Tesco, which is closer to our home - a benefit of city living. It also got me thinking about one of the most positive elements of lockdown living I'd noticed - the virtually empty roads around our home. My daily walking route through the suburbs of Phibsboro, Glasnevin and Drumcondra during those weeks was transformed from the usual all-day traffic bottlenecks to streets deserted by vehicles. It was heavenly. And now we were getting a rebate (in voucher form) from our car insurers - fantastic! However, when I checked how much we'd paid them at the beginning of the year, I wondered how they came to the princely sum of (EURO)30. Our insurance for 2020 was (EURO)655.37, for two named drivers on a 15-year-old, 1.6-litre car with no claims ever made by either of us. This, we were repeatedly assured by all the brokers and insurance companies we checked with before renewing, was a 'pretty good' deal. Well, it was better than the (EURO)757.72 we paid in 2018 and it's less than we had to pay for this year, (EURO)692.42, although we did change cars during the summer and 'upgraded' to a 2012 model. That One4all voucher, benevolently posted out to mark the fact we barely touched our car for a good chunk of 2020, came to less than 5% of what we'd handed over at the beginning of the year. Better than a slap in the face maybe, but only just. And when it was reported this week that after all the promises and work done on our behalf by the Government to tackle insurance costs, the most we can really hope for is a reduction of 10%, it hardly felt like something to celebrate. Especially given that there's no sign of premiums dropping yet, despite the amount paid out in personal injuries claims having fallen by half in the past six months. And that is the case for premiums across the wide range of those who are legally bound to buy insurance - businesses, consumers, community and voluntary groups, for instance. At the end of April, new guidelines came into effect to reduce the amount that can be awarded for some personal injuries. Preliminary data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) showed the average payout had decreased by 50% since the start of the year. It also showed that 78% of PIAB awards are now (EURO)15,000 or less, compared with 30% in 2020. Enterprise Minister Leo Varadkar hailed the figures as proof that Government measures to tackle the cost of insurance and bring it into line with other European countries were working and that people should see a 'recognisable reduction' in their premiums over the next few months. As is often the case with Varadkar, his idea of 'recognisable' appears to differ a lot from what most of the rest of us think of as 'recognisable'. The owner of Kennco Insurance, John Kennedy, was depressingly candid about what the 50% drop in awards might actually mean for consumers. He told RTÉ News that he expected premiums would reduce by 10%; nothing close to 50%. Apparently, it's because the new reforms will not reduce the biggest awards for cases of severe injury, where much of the compensation goes towards a plaintiff's expenses, such as around-the-clock care. 'We have had it actuarily assessed,' he said. 'And we feel that hopefully there will be about a 10% saving.' Hopeful of 10%? So next year we can be 'hopeful' that our car insurance will drop to (EURO)623.18? I 'recognise' that this is still a large sum of money. And my family are lucky, in that we're not trying to insure our business and we're not young drivers trying to get a car on the road. Of course, I realise the halcyon days of 2013, when we paid (EURO)339.59 to insure our car, are long gone, never to return. Insurance companies insist our premiums were far too low for far too long, given, they have claimed, the high rate of costly payouts in this country. But is there any reason to believe that Irish consumers will ever get a fair deal when it comes to mundane day-to-day living costs in this country? As recently as a few weeks ago, the European Commission stated that Irish insurers had breached EU antitrust rules by restricting competition in the country's motor market. It pointed out certain conditions of access to a data-sharing system, controlled by Insurance Ireland, which 'denied access... to companies that had a legitimate interest in joining it' It also said 'hurdles remain in place that might affect companies seeking to enter the Irish motor insurance market'. Also in June, we learned that the price of goods and services for consumers in this country was the second highest in the EU last year. The new Eurostat figures further revealed that the cost of housing and utilities bills is higher in Ireland than anywhere else in the bloc. It's a little sickening to have something you've always suspected so wantonly confirmed - housing costs, which take into account the amount spent on repairs, electricity, gas and other fuel bills, are nearly 78% higher than the EU average. We're the third most expensive EU country in which to buy a car, our public transport costs are 37% higher and our internet and telephone bills are 40% bigger than the EU average. And let's not forget how much we're charged for medicines. It's rare that once prices go up they ever truly come down again. And if the most we can 'hope' for is a 10% drop, well then, that One4all voucher is suddenly looking a lot more generous than I first thought."

She told how she is saving (EURO)3,000 every month for an early retirement and says her lifestyle has not changed all that much since she started budgeting. Ms Farrell is obviously very disciplined and determined, but can the rest of us do something similar, especially those with mortgages and childcare costs? Here are 10 ways that will, at the very least, go some of the way to ditching your debts and achieving financial freedom. Overpay your mortgage You could knock tens of thousands of euro off your borrowing and become mortgage-free much earlier than originally planned by overpaying it. You can pay a ""lump sum overpayment"". Alternatively, you can pay more each month. This is known as regular overpayments. A useful way to work out how much money you could save and how many years you could shave off your mortgage term is to input some figures into the ""Extra mortgage payment calculator"" on the website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. Suppose you have 25 years left on your mortgage. You have (EURO)180,000 left to pay. If you overpay by (EURO)350 each month, you could shave close to 10 years off the mortgage term and save almost (EURO)26,000 in interest repayments. Now that is worth considering. Bash your credit card debt away One way to do this is to apply for a personal loan with a credit union. Typical annual interest rates on a credit union loan are 9pc. Speak with your local credit union. Once you meet the criteria and demonstrate your ability to repay any loan, it should be able to help and can work out a payment schedule that works for your budget, says Kevin Johnson, chief executive of the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA). Ditch the brands Pre-pandemic research found that the average household spends around (EURO)100 on food at home. Doubtless, this figure will have risen since. Brands are the problem. If you buy supermarkets' own labels they are often up to 50pc cheaper than premium labels and often you are not compromising on quality, says Paul Bailey of the Irish League of Credit Unions. Look at your shopping list and see where you can trade down. The league reckons the potential saving could be up to (EURO)1,000 over a year. Avoid food waste The average family could save (EURO)700 a year by taking simple steps to reduce their food waste, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Vegetables, fruit and salad are most often binned. Top tips include storing potatoes in a dry, dark place; keeping tomatoes in the open air; storing carrots loose in the bottom drawer of the fridge; and keeping strawberries in the fridge with their green tops on. Save on energy costs Household energy bills are set to rise by up to (EURO)300 over the next couple of months. We may have 11 suppliers competing for our custom in this market, but almost all of them have raised their prices, with some announcing two rises. Your best bet is to make sure you are not on a high tariff. Households should switch to a cheaper supplier to save money, especially with those price rises being announced. It is quick and easy to switch and can be done online in minutes. Someone paying standard rates and who switches supplier could save well over (EURO)400 a year on average on their combined gas and electricity costs. Switch motor insurance provider When it comes to insurance, loyalty is punished rather than rewarded. That is why it is imperative that people don't simply accept the renewal price given by their current insurer. Pricing and quotes can vary wildly from person to person and insurer to insurer, says Jonathan Hehir of brokerage www.Coverinaclick.ie. Either call all of the direct insurers for a quote or get a broker to get quotes from them on your behalf. You can easily save (EURO)200 or more by getting better value cover. Make simple energy-saving switches in the home Turn off lights when you're not using them, get into the habit of only using the heating when you need it. Only wash your clothes on full loads and turn appliances off rather than leaving them on standby. The Irish League of Credit Unions reckons you could take (EURO)200 off your annual electricity bill by being more conscious of the electricity you are using. Ease up on the takeaways The lockdowns have shown us how much we spend on indulgences. Of course, we need to treat ourselves now and again and support local businesses, but we also need to make sure we don't spend too much on the likes of takeaways. Studies from before the pandemic show the average household spends (EURO)90 a month on takeaways and fast food. Focusing more on dining in could yield significant savings over time. Some estimates indicate potential annual savings of (EURO)1,000 by cutting down on takeaways. Draw up a budget Every household should have some form of financial plan or budget in place. However, the form and/ or detail of this plan will change depending on the household. Set a budget based on how often you get paid and stick to it. Don't underestimate the power of a good budget, says Kevin Johnson of CUDA. Stop paying money for stuff you don't need We're talking here about coffee, bottled water and lunches. There are cheaper alternatives to takeaway coffees and bought lunches. Throw into the mix gym membership that's not used. Cutting down here could save you over (EURO)600 a year."

While 86% of estate agents expect national property prices to increase by an average of 6% over the next 12 months, a similar number say the main reason for the increase is lack of supply. Agents in Munster and Connacht/Ulster expect prices to increase by 7% over the next 12 months. The figure in Leinster is 6% while in Dublin, where prices are highest, it is forecast at 4%. The sharp rises are among the key findings of a survey of more than 200 estate agents by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland (SCSI) released yesterday. Estate agents said the higher price forecast for properties outside Dublin was due to the Covid effect of a dramatic rise in the numbers of people working from home. Yet, despite Covid, eight out of ten respondents reported an increase in enquiries and viewings over the past three months. The SCSI/Central Bank of Ireland Residential Property Price Survey is a threemonthly sentiment survey of SCSI members, consisting mainly of estate agents, auctioneers and surveyors. SCSI president TJ Cronin the said lack of supply, construction lockdowns and steep increases in the cost of materials, meant prices would continue to rise. 'We had a supply crisis pre- Covid and that has simply deepened due to Covid. While 45% of respondents in the survey reported a fall in selling instructions in the second quarter of 2021, 81% reported an increase in enquiries. 'In addition, eight out of ten agents are reporting low stock levels. And that's why so many agents were seeing a consistent increase in enquiries even during the worst of Covid. 'While prospective sellers were reluctant to put their property on the market, buyers, who in many cases were in a position to increase their savings, were left chasing a reducing number of properties. 'While it's a sellers' market right now, the rate of price increases we are seeing currently is not sustainable in the long term. Agents believe the only way to address the affordsions ability challenge is to increase housing supply. 'Over the last 16 months the construction sector was closed down several times and the cumulative impact of the slowdown on new home construction will be with us until 2023 at least. 'Increases in the price of steel, timber, plastic and insulation products - due to supply chain and transportation issues - and labour shortages across a number of trades will also lead to higher prices for new homes.' Meanwhile, housing campaigner David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation said the forecasted price rises were down to a lack of supply, so developers with planning permission should use it and build straight away or risk it being withdrawn. 'How are we going to resolve it? Simple, build more houses. We need to hire all the builders directly, declare a State of Emergency, lock everything down for three years, don't give out any planning permis- unless they're for houses that people can start building straight away. 'Any planning permission that is not utilised by the end of this year automatically expires. Use it or lose it.' SCSI chief Shirley Coulter said the Covid pandemic had deepened the housing crisis and extraordinary measures were now needed. 'We believe 400,000 new homes - social, affordable and private builds - will need to be built over the next ten years to meet pent-up demand and the needs of our growing population. 'Current output is around 20,000 units, so a doubling of that will require a massive increase in funding and collaboration between the private and public sector. That is why we support the ESRI's recent recommendation to Government to double its current investment in housing by borrowing between (EURO)4billion and (EURO)7billion a year while availing of low interest rates. 'The ESRI estimates that if the state doubled its spend on housing from (EURO)2billion to (EURO)4billion it could deliver 18,000 units a year.

In the coming months Paschal Donohoe and Michael McGrath will have to decide whether to tell the public tax rises are required to bring borrowing under control. Could October bring an 'austerity' budget that opposition parties will no doubt seize upon to pressure the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party Coalition in the opinion polls? Most independent institutions seem to think a cautious budget is warranted. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) and Central Bank of Ireland have recently warned revenue raising measures may be required, especially if the Government plans to follow through on its spending commitments. There is a long list of promises to fund; the cost of the ageing population, climate change targets, the National Development Plan, the rollout of Sláintecare and social housing delivery - while at the same time aiming to bring down the deficit from close to (EURO)20bn in 2021. The Ministers for Finance and Expenditure have both been tightlipped on whether revenue raising measures will be required. Some have asserted an 'austerity' budget is out of the question. However, this week's National Economic Dialogue struck a different tone; the Taoiseach asserting current spending levels are unsustainable. Is the political ground now being prepared for tax rises in October? THE DELICATE JOB OF ROLLING BACK EMERGENCY SPENDING The immediate priority will be rolling back the emergency Covid-19 income supports such as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Emergency Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). This will be a very politically sensitive issue, highlighted by the frustration on the delayed re-opening of indoor hospitality until at least July 19. The long-term damage from the pandemic will soon become clearer to see. Specifically, the extent of lingering unemployment and how many small businesses will be no longer viable, absent of government support. The latest data are not particularly encouraging. The Department of Social Protection announced PUP claims had declined to 228,000 this week - the lowest level since October. However, this still means the Covid-19 adjusted unemployment rate was 18pc at end-June. That said, this measure is unreliable, overstating the damage, if not the cost, of the PUP supports. For example, 8pc of PUP recipients are full-time students who are not normally considered unemployed by the CSO. Worryingly, just 11,200 persons closed their PUP claim to return to work last week. This is a relatively small decline, compared to the halving of PUP claims from 440,000 in early April. It could indicate the substantial job gains since the economy began to re-open are starting to wane. This raises the fear of lingering unemployment. There were still 20,000 PUP claims from construction workers and 35,000 from wholesale/retail last week, despite Covid-19 restrictions on activity in these sectors being relaxed in April and May. Also, the pay of 302,000 employees was subsidised by the EWSS scheme in May, costing (EURO)2.2bn so far in 2021. PUP payments have cost (EURO)3.1bn this year and (EURO)370m has been paid out to small/medium enterprises under the Coronavirus Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). These emergency supports now exceed the (EURO)5.4bn of unallocated funds set aside in last year's Budget to meet unforeseen www.costs.NO ROOM FOR NEW POLICY MOVES WITHOUT TAX HIKES April's Stability Programme update projections presented a very benign view of the public finances. The Department of Finance's forecasts were for the (EURO)18bn deficit, worth 4.7pc of GDP in 2021, but was expected to gradually narrow, close to a balanced budget by 2025, on a 'no-policy change' basis. The expectation the deficit would naturally close without consolidation measures seemed particularly odd given last year's Budget for 2021 had announced (EURO)5.4bn of permanent spending increases. This spending was predominately on health and housing, but without any commensurate effort to raise revenue. It was as if the government had been given a 'free-lunch' - raising core spending by 8pc, but with no need to raise taxes to pay for it. In May, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) delivered an unusually scathing review of the official projections for the public finances - saying they did not reflect the full cost of price inflation and the ageing population and that income tax receipts were assumed to grow at an unrealistically fast pace. Ifac's view was that the deficit would likely exceed (EURO)3bn in 2025, criticising the Government for not providing realistic fiscal targets. Ifac asserted it is important the State takes advantage of current low interest rates, temporarily keeping the deficit low, to improve debt-metrics. It argued there is a 15-20pc risk that our debt ratio might be on an unsustainable path by 2025 under current plans. Also, given the (EURO)5.4bn of permanent spending rises in last year's budget, Ifac said there is no room for new policy measures, unless funded by tax hikes. Suffice to say this is an unwelcome message for a government heading into a budget. MORE TO DO TO BRING DOWN DEBT LEVELS It's worth bearing in mind the scale of government debt, now forecast to rise to close to (EURO)250bn by end-2022 up from (EURO)204bn in 2019. Ireland's debt/ GDP ratio looks to remain at respectable levels close to 60pc of GDP. However, expressed as a proportion of Gross National Income (GNI*), which excludes multinational sector profits, the debt ratio is expected to rise to 107pc in 2022 - suggesting Ireland has work to do to put the public finances on a sound footing. Also, the amount of government debt per person will likely have grown from (EURO)41,000 in 2019 towards (EURO)50,000 by 2022 - one of the highest levels across the OECD. Just this week, the Central Bank of Ireland warned a credible plan to reduce the public debt ratio is required in October's Budget. One reason for caution is the OECD's programme of tax reforms currently being negotiated. The Department for Finance has estimated these reforms might ultimately cost Ireland (EURO)2bn of revenues per annum. The danger is that profits, currently allocated towards Ireland, could move away. Ireland may be exposed because the top ten multinationals now account for over 40pc of the (EURO)12bn of corporate tax revenues collected. In this context, it was slightly surprising to see the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) breaking the consensus, eschewing the caution expressed by other institutions. In its most recent Quarterly Economic Commentary, Kieran Mc- Quinn argued Ireland's GDP growth will likely outstrip the cost of government borrowing for some time. Hence, his view is that the Government may be able to borrow up (EURO)4bn-(EURO)7bn more going forward to fund public investment in housing. The obvious critique is that borrowing costs may rise sharply if public debt moves onto an unsustainable path. Also, a marked rise in spending on social housing could well prove inflationary given limited capacity in the construction sector - failing to secure the desired increase in output. A more conventional view would be that greater levels of investment are required in social housing but that they should be funded from general taxation. SO WHERE WILL THE TAX AXE EVENTUALLY FALL? If Paschal Donohoe does choose to raise taxes, where will they land? The Minister for Finance has highlighted the role of the new Commission on Taxation and Welfare. Specifically, greater levels of household income support during the pandemic may warrant commensurate rises in pay-related-social-insurance (PRSI) contributions? However, a broad-based rise in income taxes, via the PRSI rate, may not prove popular. Left-leaning voices would no doubt accuse the Government of hitting the low paid. The fact that effective tax rates on low-income earners in Ireland are among the lowest in the OECD will likely do little to temper any negative reaction. That could place the onus on the 'squeezed middle' or the top 52pc marginal rate. What is clear is that a realistic discussion with the Irish public on how to bring deficit under control has barely started.

Now a leading academic is heading a battle against the clock to save our beaches from erosion,FALSE,"THEY are the jewel in our tourist crown. But according to Ireland's leading researcher on coastal erosion, unless action is taken soon, beaches around our dramatic coastline will be tarnished for decades to come. Professor Derek Jackson warns we are lagging years behind other countries in taking steps to protecting our coast. Almost three decades of research around the world, which bizarrely led to involvement in a mission to search for life on Mars, has resulted in Professor Jackson from Ulster University landing a seat at the top table of Irish academics. Admitted to the Royal Irish Academy (RIA), Ireland's most prestigious academic body, he is one of only 27 members elected this year. ""Personally it's a huge accolade to get your work recognised at this level but it also helps showcase some of the excellent geoscience being undertaken at Ulster University,"" he said. Derek Jackson exudes enthusiasm as Professor of Coastal Geomorphology in the School of Geography and Environmental Sciences on the university's Coleraine campus. And while involvement with the European Space Agency's mission to Mars in 2022 has caught worldwide attention, he is hoping authorities closer to home will now start to make serious inroads in protecting beaches before it is too late. His team is conducting regular surveys of Co Down's Newcastle to Dundrum (Murlough Bay) beach system to find out how and why our coastline changes. The work is part of the (EURO)6.4m European environment project MarPAMM (Marine Protected Area Management and Monitoring), which will help develop tools and plans to protect vulnerable marine habitats and species in the waters between Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Murlough Bay beach study explores how climate-related processes, including sea-level rises and storms, may alter the physical environment that supports protected species and habitats on our coasts. Overdevelopment and erosion along the Ards Peninsula, from Bangor along the coast to Portaferry, has also caused beaches to shrink over time. Map evidence shows the outer Ards peninsula has undergone a ""coastal squeeze"" - the distance between the high water mark and the low water mark has reduced over the last century, primarily because you have nowhere for the coast to flex in and out. Beaches like those at Mil- lisle and Ballywalter have been affected. But Northern Ireland is still lagging well behind the rest of the UK in terms of how coasts are managed, according to Professor Jackson. ""A lot of that is down to better, more informed planning to be frank,"" he said. ""In Northern Ireland, infrastructure placed within a naturally dynamic and moving coastal system has left us with a legacy issue where we are forced to defend properties or structures from coastal storms that probably shouldn't have been built. ""A general lack of environmental data/knowledge of physical processes at the coast is also a serious, fundamental problem for those trying to manage it. ""We're seeing larger, more frequent storms as a direct result of human activities accelerating changes to our climate. Unfortunately, we're far behind other nations in how we plan to manage these accelerated changes on our coasts. ""We don't have the scientific schemes in place to properly monitor what's happening. As with Covid-19, we need to follow the data and have a scientific plan in place for our coasts. ""But that requires regular data gathering over sufficient time periods, both on land and nearshore. England and Wales have established coastal observatories along their entire coastlines, a system of regular environmental monitoring programmes creating long term data sets which can be analysed and acted upon to advise in the management of the coast. ""Embarrassingly, Northern Ireland (and the Republic) are at least 15-20 years behind, which is concerning as our coastline is our one of our best assets in attracting investment from tourism."" There is cause for optimism though. ""Recent efforts by DAERA in commissioning a new 3D airborne coastline mapping project is a significant first step as it will provide an up-to-date assessment of the physical coastal (and marine) environments in Northern Ireland and will act as a great base to build from,"" he explained. ""But we still need that coastal observatory to help establish and maintain regular gathering of environmental data. ""I have been fortunate to have travelled all around the world, and by comparison we have some of the most beautiful coastlines right here on our doorstep, but we want to continue to be in that position in decades to come."" Professor Jackson said the last thing Northern Ireland needs it to is build more unnecessary sea defences to protect inappropriate and ill-informed planning decisions. ""Through a lack of understanding rock armouring our coastline has been allowed where it did not need defending by hard engineering,"" he said. ""In many instances, waves reflect off these types of structures to strip away the beach sand, resulting in a longer term impact of beach erosion. ""It's a fool's paradise to over-defend by engineering when nature has its own way of adjusting, just on a little longer timescale,"" he said. ""Planning needs to be better informed by the science and by those who understand how natural coastal systems behave over time. Only then will decisions on planned developments at the coast be on safer ground."" Professor Jackson now feels that the body of knowledge established at Ulster University puts it in an important position to advise future efforts to manage coastlines. ""Adequate government funding is still required if this is to be addressed seriously. Only then, will we be in a better position to manage our coastal resources properly. Climate change impacts have hugely accelerated this funding need,"" he said. The National Trust is responsible for around a quarter of the beaches in Northern Ireland, and Climate and Environment Adviser Sean Maxwell agreed that a new drive to protect beaches is needed more than ever. ""Our dynamic and ever-changing landscape is a home for nature, a place for people to enjoy, and it needs protecting,"" he said. ""Given the importance of Northern Ireland's coastline to the environment, economy and culture, long term investment is needed to increase understanding of how it is changing, and to enable coastal decision makers and landowners to make informed choices in the face of increasing climate pressures. ""Some good progress has been made, with the creation of the NI Coastal Forum, and commitments from its two lead Departments (DAERA and DFI) to develop a Coastal Observatory - something National Trust has been calling for. ""But already National Trust has witnessed unprecedented storm damage to fragile coastal environments at Strangford Lough and Murlough National Nature Reserve,"" he added. ""Coastal squeeze due to sea level rise could lead to the complete loss of important coastal habitats, some of which are vital to our understanding of nature based solutions to climate change,"" he said. ""We must act now to better understand Northern Ireland's coastal erosion risk in the context of a changing climate. ""We desperately need climate change legislation to secure the policies, systems, knowledge, and funding that allows decision makers to plan for future change."" Back at Ulster University, Professor Jackson's expertise will next see him working on high energy storm events and in particular on the effects of Hurricane Irma, an extremely rare category 5 hurricane that decimated Antigua and Barbuda in 2017. ""Our research will contribute to future emergency planning with our findings showing where storm wave impact was highest and where it is likely to be in the future,"" he explained, hoping to research on site in the Caribbean next year. ""Over the last 10-15 years, environmental issues and climate change have accelerated so much that it is now becoming part of our social conscience, and we're in a great position here at Ulster University to show those who need to know, what it will take to change that, even if politicians have come to it late in the day. ""We've seen how investment in science has helped bring a Covid-19 vaccine to the world in such a short period of time. The same can be done to address the environment, particularly at our coasts in a rapidly changing climate."" Then it's all eyes on Mars as his research plays a part in the 2022 mission by the European Space Agency. ""Several years ago we received research funding for another separate study, examining the airflow over coastal dunes at Magilligan Point. In that work, we used aeronautical computer modelling software usually used in Formula 1 car design and instead replaced cars with sand dunes to simulate the wind coming across the surface of the dunes at Magilligan. It worked brilliantly."" he explained. ""We then applied these techniques to the surface of Mars which revealed new insights into how winds helped shape the surface of Mars."" That work, which was subsequently published in the prestigious Nature Communications journal, then grew from there. He added: ""We currently hold research funding from the UK Space Agency, that will feed into the European Space Agency's rover mission to Mars in 2022, specifically examining the winds at the landing site and surrounding areas.

As the threat posed by Covid-19 continues to recede in parallel with the rollout of the HSE's vaccine programme, BNP Paribas Bank and US pharmaceutical giant ResMed Inc have executed their respective long-term leases on a combined 60,000sq ft of office accommodation at the newly-developed Termini. The quoting rent for the two transactions was EUR 35 per sq ft, and both deals are understood to have transacted at close to this level with a combined commitment for a term certain in excess of 10 years.  Europe's largest bank, BNP Paribas, have signed up to a long lease on the fourth floor extending to more than 40,000sq ft, and were represented by Keith O'Neill of BNP Paribas Real Estate.  Commenting on the move, head of BNP Paribas Ireland Derek Kehoe said: ""BNP Paribas are delighted to participate in the Termini project. This exciting new building fits very well with our new flex working model. It will greatly enhance our employee experience and our ability to work collaboratively and sustainably."" ResMed have signed up to a long lease of just over 20,000sq ft on part of the fifth floor and were represented by commercial real estate advisors Avison Young. ResMed is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, operates in 140 countries and has revenues of more than $3 billion (EUR 2.5bn).  'Best-in-class'  Referring to its decision to locate at the Termini, a spokesperson for the company said: ""ResMed, a global leader in digital health, is looking forward to building a next-gen site for its growing Irish team in best-in-class offices."" Completed by Aldgate Developments in December 2020, the A3 BER-rated Termini building comprises 224,000sq ft of LEED 'Gold' V4-accredited space. Designed by Reddy Architecture & Urbanism, the property has finishes that joint letting agents Cushman & Wakefield and Knight Frank say surpass those available in Dublin city centre. The Termini offers efficient floor plates which typically extend to 40,000sq ft, 3m full floor-to-ceiling glazing, a ground-floor wellness suite, an inhouse food and beverage station at ground-floor level, 215 bike spaces, and hotel standard shower and changing rooms.  The building's location adjacent to the Luas green line stop at Sandyford provides occupiers with direct access to Dublin city centre in 20 minutes. There are 1,400 public car parking spaces alongside the Termini, and the N11 quality bus corridor is a short distance away.  Paul Molloy, leasing director for Aldgate Developments, said: ""We are delighted to welcome these two significant multinationals to Termini. Both are impressive organisations, and worldwide leaders in their respective fields. As we have begun to emerge from the pandemic, we have seen a significant increase in enquiries and viewings in recent weeks."" Discussions are understood to be progressing with several other potential tenants around the remaining space at the Termini, with availability from 10,000sq ft upwards. Aisling Tannam of Cushman & Wakefield and Jim O'Reilly of Knight Frank represented Aldgate Developments in the latest transactions, with Eversheds Sutherland having provided legal advice."

Asked how his centenary year is going, the TUV leader’s body immediately stiffens as he begins to lament how celebrations have been “deliberately stymied” through republicans’ “malevolent intent”. Unionists “haven’t been allowed to plant as much as a rose bush at Stormont” to mark what he believes is a “very significant event”. Mr Allister, who last Wednesday evening was re-elected unopposed as his party’s leader, acknowledges too that 2021 so far hasn’t been a great year for unionism or the union. While he may have “saw off more DUP and Ulster Unionist leaders than I’d care to remember”, celebrations have been muted against what he regards as an adverse political backdrop. “This year has brought to the fore a very conscious and deliberate attempt to end the union, courtesy of the protocol,” he says. “I’m under no illusion about the union-dismantling nature of the protocol – that’s its purpose and design.” He cites Mr Justice Colton’s ruling in the recent legal challenge, the first instalment of which he and his co-applicants lost, noting how the trade border “repeals the cornerstone of the union, namely economic union”. “The protocol is in every manifestation in the process of dismantling the union and if allowed to take hold and bed in, will do that,” he says. He wasn’t surprised to lose the judicial review and doesn’t hold out much hope for the Court of Appeal, which is likely to hear the case in the autumn. However, he is more hopeful of the Supreme Court finding in the applicants’ favour, though at the earliest that’ll be next year. The TUV leader believes that if the protocol is ruled to be in conflict with UK constitutional law then “it dies”. He briefly appears wistful as he ponders the potential of a court victory. Not only do the post-Brexit trade arrangements undermine the union “overtly” by economic separation, the TUV leader argues, but also “covertly, by building an all-island economy as a stepping stone towards political unity”. The EU itself, he says, has demonstrated throughout its lifetime how political union flows progressively from economic union. He argues that businesses in the north are being forced to re-orientate supply chains away from Britain “thereby building an all-Ireland economy and causing Northern Ireland to increasingly look away from London to Dublin”. Mr Allister believes economic union and ultimately political union is the “hope and expectation of those peddling the protocol”. He likens it to a “salami-slicing of the union”, which in the process demonstrates how “fatuous and empty the so-called consent principle is” “All you have to ask consent for is the final hauling down of the Union flag at Hillsborough Castle – in other words, you make all the constitutional changes short of the ultimate handover, and you don’t need anyone’s consent,” he says. This “dismantling of the union by stealth” is the protocol’s “evil genius”, says the TUV leader, and is also what makes nationalists support it: “As nationalists, I’m sure they cannot believe how easy it’s been through the guise of the protocol to obtain objectives that the IRA tried to achieve by violence and others through political activity – and now it’s being done for them through the machinations of the protocol.” However, he says the other side of this coin is “stoking up irrepressible unionist resentment”. He speaks of the “folly” of his one-time DUP colleague Edwin Poots, whose department he says is implementing the checks on goods arriving from Britain, while at the same time objecting to the measures. “He and his party need to grow a backbone – if they don’t implement it there can be no protocol.” What Mr Allister characterises as “substantial disconnect between the DUP and much of its base” is caused by the party’s ministers “sustaining an instrument which is dismantling the union”. Uncharacteristically, there isn’t a great amount of detail when he’s asked to list the difficulties consumers and businesses are encountering as a result of the Irish Sea trade border. He cites an unnamed seed company that no longer sells its wares in the north and tells how livestock exhibitors who take their prize bulls to England cannot bring them home if unsold and therefore must either sell the animal for a reduced price or make it spend six months in quarantine. Mr Allister insists the “chaotic and dire” economic implications will worsen when the grace period ends, yet these concerns are secondary when compared to the constitutional consequences, which cannot be mitigated away. It’s clear most of his ire over the protocol is directed at the EU but he concedes that British prime minister Boris Johnson, right – “a totally untrustworthy character” – was complicit in creating the new trading conditions. However, the Tory leader appears to be afforded the benefit of doubt because he “didn’t realise what he was doing constitutionally” and was governed by the “expediency of the moment” in his desire to get Brexit done. Notably, Mr Allister believes the protocol lessens the prospect of unionists ever acquiescing to a united Ireland on a democratic basis because if the trade border prevails, they will feel unity has “been delivered by stealth in the underhand process of the protocol”. “It would create an irrepressible resentment which would not be easily assuaged and would leave, within that Ireland, a people feeling very oppressed and cheated – and I don’t think that’s a recipe for stability anywhere,” he says. “There’s a difference between the people of Northern Ireland freely and openly giving consent and the people of Northern Ireland being denied the right to consent at key stages in the process.” He argues that the SDLP is happy to eschew its democratic principles by “swallowing a state of vassalage”, while once-eurosceptic Sinn Féin is being expedient and “using the EU to advance its own ideological interests”. The DUP’s role in accommodating what became the protocol began two months after 2016’s EU referendum, the TUV leader says, when Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness penned a joint letter to Theresa May “demanding special arrangements” for the north. He sees that correspondence as the “beginning of the bandwagon for special status that became the protocol via the backstop”. The DUP’s second major error was in October 2019, according to Mr Allister, when the party assented to a regulatory border in the belief that it would be subject to a veto by the Stormont assembly. “But of course once Boris had that concession he pocketed it and shredded the piece about Stormont consent,” he adds. “They were also slow to recognise and face up to the constitutional implications of the protocol – we had some foolish talk at Christmas from Arlene Foster about the opportunities of the protocol.” Mr Allister admits that unionist disquiet around the protocol has created electoral opportunities for his party, which for the first time plans to field candidates in all 18 of the north’s constituencies in next year’s Stormont election. He says the TUV has received more than 800 party membership applications since the turn of the year, many from “rank and file DUP members” – an almost quadrupling of its membership. When it’s suggested that ardent Brexiteer and former Labour MP Kate Hoey may run as a TUV candidate, he doesn’t rule it out. “Baroness Hoey would be a credit to any party but I have to respect she has a role and a function [in the House of Lords] which I imagine is her priority,” he says. Asked whether he’ll rule out her candidacy, the TUV leader says: “It’s not for me to rule out”, before confirming that she is not a party member. “So the presumption would be no,” he adds. However, he argues that “unionist disdain [over the protocol] will be diluted at the polls because of the absurdity of the arrangements whereby we appoint a first and deputy first minister”. “This affords the DUP a false card to play, where they claim ‘vote for us to keep Sinn Féin out’ when they are in fact the very people who then bring them [Sinn Féin] in,” he says. “The DUP do this on the pretence that there’s actually a distinction between the first and deputy first minister when there isn’t – one can’t write a letter without the other.” Mr Allister says if the DUP’s objection to a Sinn Féin first minister is “more than a phoney concern or an electoral gaming concern”, then the party should refuse to nominate for the first or deputy first minister’s role after the election. He also believes that if the DUP is sincere in its opposition to the protocol it should disrupt the north-south institutions. Mr Allister also believes that Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party should make Boris Johnson choose between ditching the Irish Sea border or overseeing the collapse of the Stormont institutions. However, he argues his old party believes the devolved institutions, and “keeping Sinn Féin in power”, takes primacy over the protocol."

The spotlight has fallen on the long-term leasing system after it emerged last week investment firms would not have to pay stamp duty surcharges on bulk house purchases if they leased them to local authorities. The Government earlier this year announced plans to clamp down on house purchases by large investors by increasing stamp duty to 10 per cent on the purchase of more than 10 houses. Opposition parties accused the Government of incentivising ""cuckoo funds"" by granting the latest tax exemption. Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien insisted the exemption was necessary to avoid risking new lease deals that had been agreed with investment funds for up to 2,400 homes nationally. However, the four Dublin local authorities alone are already leasing close to 1,000 homes under such long-term leasing arrangements.  National average  While the national average cost of social housing leases is just above EUR 15,000 per home annually, in Dublin, where rents are higher, the local authorities pay more. In 2020, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council paid an average of EUR 18,698 per lease, followed by Dublin City Council (EUR 18,605), and Fingal (EUR 17,840) and South Dublin county councils (EUR 17,751). The Long Term Leasing Initiative was introduced in 2009 to allow local authorities to enter into leases paying 80 per cent of market rates for 10-20 years as a means of meeting social housing needs. In 2018 a new 25-year ""enhanced"" leasing scheme was introduced, which saw the rents increased to 95 per cent of market rates with index-linked reviews every three years. The scheme has proved popular with pension and other investment funds due to the guaranteed long-term  returns. Dublin City Council has the largest number of 25-year leases with property owners, at 587. The council said just under a quarter of these had been agreed with ""private individuals"" but the remaining 447 were with ""limited companies, Icav's or investment/pension trusts"".  Investment funds  The vast majority of the leases are for homes in Dublin 7 and Dublin 8, with 124 homes in the former and 118 in the latter. The next largest number is in the north inner city, where 47 have been leased with smaller numbers across the rest of the city and suburbs.  South Dublin County Council leases 232 properties from investment funds for social housing.  The largest number is in Tallaght, where 86 home are provided through long-term leases, followed by Clondalkin with 84, Lucan with 28, and Rathfarnham-Templeogue with 26. Just seven are leased from such firms in the Palmerstown area and one in Firhouse. Fingal County Council leases 213 properties ""for social housing purposes from investment firms"", with these homes leased ""across the county"", it said. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council said it had entered into ""nine long-term leases with investment firms, which have delivered a total of 95 properties"". The leases are in ""various location"" but all are for 25 years. "

A 'green wave' shows 41% say they are currently, or have already upgraded their windows, doors or insulation in recent years to make their homes more energy-efficient. Another 10% say they are planning similar works in the next three years while 14% of homeowners are in the process of, or have already installed, solar panels or a heat pump in their home, with a further 22% planning to do so in the next three years, according to AIB's Sustainability Index. Nearly two thirds say they are living in a home that would require a deep retrofit in order to significantly improve its energy efficiency, according to the research. The bank has also seen consumers go green in other ways, with a rise in consumers purchasing hybrid and electric cars - 28% of those who do not currently drive an electric car said they plan to switch to an electric car within the next three years. The rise in consumer spending on sustainable solutions comes at a time when pentup demand is starting to be released and large parts of the economy are reopening. People have also spent more time than ever in their homes over the past year and as home working looks to be a permanent feature of our lives into the future, consumers are making choices now that will see their bills and carbon footprint reduce. There are significant savings for consumers who make their homes more energyefficient. They can save an average of (EURO)2,150 per year on home heating, moving from a G rating at (EURO)4,000 to a D rating at (EURO)1,850 for a 100 sq m three-bedroom semi-detached home, according to figures from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. This can be done through upgrading existing heating systems and investing in new insulation or windows. Likewise, customers with a current BER rating of C can use the AIB Green Loan to upgrade their home and bring it up to a BER of B, a potential annual saving of (EURO)500 on energy bills. It also qualifies them for the AIB Green Mortgage, which allows them to make further savings. Customers can take out a Green Personal Loan for up to ten years for up to (EURO)60,000. AIB's chief sustainability officer Yvonne Holmes said: 'As the economy continues to reopen, and people are planning for new ways of working and living, we want to support our customers as they seek to be more sustainable and in turn reduce their living costs. Since the launch of our Green Loan earlier this year, we have seen strong demand from our customers to make sustainable home and vehicle upgrades.'"

Only one was a Catholic and he was temporary. The comment was intended as a statement of fact, rather than a boast, but it has dogged his memory; probably unfairly because he had no record of sectarianism, and although an Orangeman and a future grand master, he attended the funeral of the nationalist MP, Joseph Devlin, in 1934. Andrews was born 150 years ago on July 17th, 1871, to a family of Scots origin who could trace their roots in Ulster to the 17th century and had been heavily involved in the linen industry since the 18th century in and around the village of Comber, Co Down. His lineage also included William Drennan, a founder of the United Irishmen, and the author of the bitter ode to the young Presbyterian farmer William Orr who had been hanged after being falsely convicted of administering a seditious oath to a soldier and another poem, When Ireland First Arose, which contained the phrase the Emerald Isle.  John was the oldest of five children. The second brother, James, was apprenticed to Harland & Wolff and rose through the ranks mainly because of his ability, although the fact that an uncle was married to Eliza Pirrie, the sister of the chairman, Lord Pirrie, didn't harm his prospects. He was one of the principal designers of the Titanic. He sailed on that ship's ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912 and went down with it. Survivors remembered him urging passengers to enter the lifeboats rather than trying to save himself. The third brother, James, became a lord chief justice of Northern Ireland and the fourth, William, was one of the best-known personalities in Irish cricketing circles in the first half of the 20th century. Relief works  John became a member of the Ulster Unionist Council in 1910 and in 1918 he helped to found the Ulster Labour Unionist Association with the object of ensuring that the unionist working class wouldn't pivot to socialism, In June 1921, he was appointed labour minister and was praised for the efficient distribution of £500,000 for relief works in Belfast, the only positive result of the Craig-Collins pact of March 30th, 1922.  He was promoted to finance in 1937 but when he became prime minister in 1940, he was almost 70, partially deaf, and lacking the vision or energy to face the challenges of the war.  Belfast was considered safe from an attack by the Luftwaffe because it was so far north, and when the bombers arrived in April and May 1941, the city was almost entirely unprepared. It had only five anti-aircraft batteries and a tiny number of air raid shelters and very few of the children had been evacuated. Almost 1,000 people were killed, 100,000 homes destroyed and many thousands suffered great hardship. The government was widely blamed for its inertia and incompetence and there was a rumour, not entirely unfounded, that it was overly concerned with protecting Edward Carson's statue at Stormont.  Winston Churchill's decision not to introduce conscription in the North was also seen by unionists as a failure of their government and backbench MPs finally revolted in April 1943, forcing Andrews' resignation on May 1st. He was replaced by Basil Brooke, later Lord Brookeborough, but he remained leader of the party for three years and continued to represent mid-Down, unopposed, until 1956. He was succeeded there by his son Jack, a founder of the pro power-sharing Unionist Party in 1972.  Unlike the other prime ministers of Northern Ireland, Andrews didn't receive a peerage. Churchill was dissatisfied with his government's contribution to the war effort and, particularly, his failure to deal with industrial disputes that disrupted aircraft production, while his relations with the treasury were often turbulent. His insistence on parity of treatment with Britain in welfare matters was his major achievement and it benefitted both sections of the community, but it went largely unnoticed. After his death in 1956 his remains were buried in its cemetery in Comber, in land provided by one of his great-grandfathers."

Director of the Durrell Library of Corfu, he has also published widely on Lawrence Durrell's writings, as well as on Irish theatre, notably the works of Wilde and Friel.  English by origin, he is a graduate of RTÉ as well as TCD and for the past 20 years a full-time resident of Corfu. He is passionately engaged with the life of the island and the wider Greek world. Nonetheless he proudly claims the identification of ""xenos"", foreigner or outsider, and uses this vantage to deliver a frank commentary on his adopted country. There is probably a salty Greek expression for the English euphemism ""candid friend"", which would fit him closely too. In 2015 Pine published Greece through Irish Eyes, and his new collection again pinpoints ostensible similarities between the two countries: a history of struggles for independence from the resented domination of a larger neighbour; a traumatic memory of civil war; a frontier issue (in Greece's case with Macedonia) that will not go away.  Both countries have been subjected to condescending and prejudiced national cliches (Pine is very good on the ""Balkanist"" inventions of imperialist writers such as John Buchan). More subtly, there are cultural assonances in both countries' approach to history, story-telling and dramatic enactments - immortalised in Theo Angelopoulos's great film The Travelling Players, where the 20th-century Greek experience is expressed through the story of an itinerant acting company, constantly attempting to achieve a finished performance.  But Pine is equally attuned to the ways in which Greece and Ireland differ. Though both countries suffered the infliction of ""austerity"" measures after the economic crash, Greece's condition has remained critical. ""Austerity"", Pine remarks, was a way of life in Greece before the word acquired its recent connotations: ""first, the austerity of the landscape, climate and geography; second, the facts of history imposing a subsistence existence on the vast majority of the people; and third, the economic conditions under which its 'independence' has been conducted"".  Politics after the crisis have not, mercifully, enabled an Irish party to emerge equivalent to the neo-fascist Golden Dawn in Greece. Ireland does not suffer the kind of diplomatic and territorial aggression inflicted by Erdogan's Turkey. And Ireland has not been faced, like Greece, with the devastating impact of wave upon wave of refugees bringing unbearable pressure to bear upon the country's fragile economy and ecosystems.  While tourism and the exploitation of a beautiful landscape (a preoccupation of Pine's) is vital to both countries, in Ireland this is part of the economy, not - as in Greece - a devouring presence at the centre. And while criticism can be levelled at aspects of Ireland's public services, the picture Pine draws of the nepotism and corruption to be found in - inter alia - political appointments, public broadcasting, museums and the pervasive black economy suggests a deep-rooted Greek malaise.  Self-criticism is not just the privilege of the xenos, and Pine quotes some astringent Greek commentators who are equally caustic about their country's continuing crisis. One of these, the novelist Vangelis Hatziyannidis, sardonically refers to the Greek tendency to ""spend more time planning the past than planning the future"". It is a phrase that stays in the mind. The last section of the book reprints (in Greek and English) Pine's columns for the Greek journal Kathemerini, including those which led to the termination of his contract, when he denounced controversial plans to ""develop"" an unspoiled peninsula in Corfu and made too-frank connections to the political interests backing it. The xenos had gone a step too far.  But his argument holds good that, ""though the Greek people allowed an incomplete and inadequate system to evolve . . . it is in their everyday culture that their strength lies"". For all his fierce critique of the troika's policy towards Greece after the crash, and his dislike of the ""megalithic"" aspects of today's EU, Pine's sensibility is intrinsically European.  And by a sad irony, the catastrophe of Brexit has underlined his outsider status, since despite long residence in both Ireland and Greece, he is burdened with that new liability in Europe, a UK passport. As Boris Johnson's England shrinks into a self-parodic and corrupt backwater, fantasising about delusional ""sovereignty"" and a long-gone imperial role, ""planning the past"" has become a syndrome more relevant to Richard Pine's country of origin than those he has so imaginatively adopted and interpreted.

'But this looting is und­ermining our businesses here... our economy, our community. It is und­ermining everything.'

And that makes all kinds of sense when the taxi driver drops me off at a large glass-fronted house at the foot of the Dublin mountains, with split-level gardens, and a flower-lined tennis court. But in fact this is Flood's childhood home. His father, Gerard, was a partner with KPMG while his elegant mother Monica, a sister-in-law of the designer John Rocha, mentors female entrepreneurs. Inside, the house is even more impressive, with paintings by artists such as Tom Climent and Sibylle Ungers lining the walls and exquisite pieces of sculpture sitting on little plinths in the hall. ""It's a party place,"" Gerard tells me as I sip a glass of wine and look out on the jaw-dropping views of the city below us. McDreamy himself (Patrick Dempsey) - who is filming in Enniskerry as we speak - couldn't be living better than this. As if the whole tableau weren't irresistible enough, Richard's impressively bilingual (English and Italian) seven-year-old son Julio comes wandering in during our chat, bringing with him a piece of mesmerising 1980s memorabilia - or 'a toy' as he calls it. It's a He-Man figure. ""Yeah, He-Man is back,"" the 38-year-old Richard tells me as waves of nostalgia wash over us both. ""What does he say, Julio?"" Julio stabs a little arm in the air, mimicking He-Man's magic sword. ""I have the powerrrrrrr!"" It could be 1987 all over again. And like Sherman in Bonfire of the Vanities, the biggest novel of that year, Richard Flood would be forgiven for looking down at the Mattel plastic and feeling that he, too, is a Master of the Universe. This is what he calls ""a very good mo- ment"" and it has all come together so quickly. What feels like just a few minutes ago he was counting himself lucky for getting onto an Irish show, the excellent Red Rock. Now he's starring in one of the most popular series in television history. And, he explains, it happened with a strange suddenness during a lull in work. ""There's a small part of me that still can't believe it's really happening. I had been in Rome, where my wife [the Italian actor Gabriella Pession] was shooting a show in which she was in almost every scene morning till night. I barely saw her for eight or nine months. I was just being a dad and after nine months of not working I was getting edgy. ""I needed to go to LA to see if something [work] was around. So I flew out and landed on the Friday and I had an email from my agent saying 'Will you meet the Grey's Anatomy people on Tuesday?'"" He thought they wanted him to read for a potential role but instead he met Ellen Pompeo, who plays the series title character Meredith Grey, and Krista Vernoff, the series' showrunner. The three had a conversation in which it seemed to Richard as if they were offering him a part. But he knew better than to count his chickens. ""Until you're on set you can't believe it's real. But then they rang on the Thursday and made an offer to my agent."" As the negotiations between his agent and the studio on the finer points of the deal unfolded, he flew back to Italy. ""I was just feeling such relief on that journey. I've had to take that flight when things haven't worked out so I was just really grateful that this time they had."" His character on the show is Cormac Hayes, a widower who becomes the new head of paediatric surgery at Grey Sloan Memorial hospital and who almost immediately butts heads with Meredith Grey. Towards the end of the mid-season finale, Hayes makes his first appearance and jousts with Meredith over medical ethics, while a subtext of sexual tension crackles in the background. Almost immediately 'McWidow' started trending on Twitter; Richard was being cast by fans as the natural successor to McDreamy, Patrick Dempsey. He shrugs sheepishly when the heartthrob thing is mentioned. ""It's better than people saying, 'He's brutal what's he doing there.' I'll take it if it's going, but to be interesting on camera you've got to be comfortable looking ugly."" The decision was taken early on that Richard would keep his own accent, and he came up with the name of the character himself. ""The character had a random name and it was actually a Welsh name but, you know, you're new on a show and you don't want to say anything. I was emailing Krista who is the showrunner and trying to explain it to her and she was sound; she said, 'Send me a bunch of names' and Cormac Hayes was just a name that nobody else had."" The role involves a fair amount of ongoing research into medical terms and the reasons behind certain procedures. ""If there are medical procedures, they give you a pronunciation guide and they explain what the medical reasons are for each thing. There is a whole room where they have dummies and different body parts. They show you how the surgery would go. Then I have some doctor friends who break it down for me. And I look at stuff on YouTube."" The role necessitated Richard and his young family moving to Los Angeles. While people have started to recognise him on the street, he's lukewarm about the city so far. ""It's great but it's a different world. I've always found it quite a tough, unforgiving place. If you're working, people love you Continued onnext page Continued from previous page and if you're not, they don't care. There are so many homeless people now and there's a juxtaposition of people who have massive wealth, and then people who can't treat their mental health issues and live in extreme poverty."" Richard himself spent his early childhood in privilege. At eight he went to boarding school, at Headfort in Kells. He says in hindsight it was quite young to be away from home - he couldn't imagine sending Julio away - and points out that his Italian in-laws consider boarding school ""cruel and unusual punishment"". ""I had homesickness. There was a lot of bullying: 11 and 12-year-olds can be pretty nasty when they want to be. But kids are pretty resilient and you find your way."" Headfort was where he first caught the acting bug and describes how its then principal, Lingard Goulding, saw potential in him. ""He was amazing. He put on a production of To Kill a Mockingbird, which he himself had adapted from the book. We did stuff by PG Wodehouse. I loved rehearsing and from then on I was involved in aspects [of drama] the whole time."" He went on to board at Clongowes Wood College before studying English, philosophy and psychology at UCD. However, a concurrent part-time course at the Gaiety School of Acting was evidence of where his real passion lay. Dropping out of his degree, he decided to concentrate on his craft and soon enrolled in the Oxford School of Drama. Drama school was ""a great leveller"", he says. ""There were people there who had nothing and then people who were quite privileged. I learned a lot of lessons there, seeing people who were working all hours to put themselves through it. I felt like a spoofer in those years because I hadn't suffered."" At the start of his career he managed to secure a number of stage roles but television was harder to break into. ""I was a bad auditioner. Every time I would think 'This could change everything...' instead of just focusing on the role and connecting with the casting director. I'd be worried about getting the lines right, when that's not what's interesting."" Crossing Lines, a crime-thriller series, represented something of a breakthrough for him. His character, a Northern Irish police detective, had ""a bit of depth"" and while filming it in Prague he became close to his co-star and the woman who would become his wife. ""I never felt like I was playing a version of myself around her. It was easy, as though we had been like that forever."" Four months into dating they found out that Gabriella was pregnant. ""The timing was terrible, we were still in Prague and we had to find all the right doctors. We were in the south of France then we went to Dublin and she had Julio here."" Through everything, Gabriella, who he married in 2016, has been a huge support. ""Being an actor herself, she really understands the business and it's incredible to have someone like that there."" Becoming a father didn't really faze him, he says, ""but the pressure to provide was a bit terrifying. There were moments when it felt we were up against it."" He was relieved to get a starring role on Red Rock. It was a lengthy commitment in Dublin, and steady work just when he needed it. When that series ended, there followed a brief period of unemployment during which he made the decision to shave his head. ""I was having a hard time, going through a professional issue with a job I was supposed to get and didn't. I changed my agent. I had long hair at the time and it was getting a bit thin on the front and I just said, 'F**k it.' I shaved the head. That was liberating on a number of fronts. And I got Shameless two weeks later."" The adaptation of Paul Abbott's British series of the same name was a success - it's still Showtime's longest running scripted drama - and Richard, playing an Irish carpenter, was a regular from season six. His performances gained a new depth in those years and the series proved serendipitous in an even more significant way for him as it introduced him to Krista Vernoff, who would years later be key in recruiting him for Grey's Anatomy. And so his arrival on the show has been anything but an overnight success. Along the way he has also dealt with his share of loss. ""One of my best friends died very suddenly from a brain tumour. Another best friend lost his wife and I really understood that pain. When you have a kid, you see the world in a different way: you experience stress, love and fear in a different way."" The ups and downs of his career have also been tough at times, he says. ""It got so bad I was thinking of packing it in. I was thinking, 'Enough is enough.'"" And he's dealt with his fair share of egomaniacs. ""There are big egos in this business. I find the biggest egos are the actors who are nearly famous or a little bit famous. The top guys are more secure."" Both he and Gabriella have ambitions, he says, to move into writing and possibly directing or producing. ""We don't want to be sort of putting our hands up looking for work all our lives. At some point you want to be the ones making the decisions."" Like the rapper on 'You Got Me' - one of The Roots tracks which plays on his stereo system as we chat - Flood is ""the type of guy who's always catching a flight"" and he and Gabriella are not so much bi-coastal, like so many of their acting peers, as bi-continental. He's slowly learning Italian - Julio giggles at his mixing up of indefinite articles - and says that, though he has a Green Card and Gabriella has citizenship by virtue of being born in Florida, the lifestyle in Italy makes it more likely they will at some point return to live there. ""The Italian and Irish cultures are very similar in many ways. They're much less interested in money than Americans are. Your status there isn't built around your net worth. I love the long lazy days there, meeting with friends in the piazza. Very little is planned and there is a lovely ease about life."" He spent the lockdown in LA, where some of his Italian relatives stayed with himself and Gabriella. ""We were all together, which was the main thing. It forced us to engage with where we were living and we had to try to find kids for Julio to play with and make friends ourselves."" He is conscious of the privilege of his background, and perhaps that is why the success of making it leaves him feeling ""more relief than anything"". ""I am part of the first generation that hasn't outdone the one before them,"" he tells me. ""Part of your identity and selfworth is tied up in status and financial security and it's hard when you grew up with that and you haven't achieved it for yourself."" And now, he has.

Promoted to senior lecturer in 1997, he retired in 2007, remaining a very productive independent scholar. He moved to London some years later, to be near his elder brothers David and Tom, who survive him. His initial research interests focused on Marxist analysis of the class relations underlying property law in East Africa and elsewhere. A highly-regarded expert on African law and legal anthropology, in later years interest in land law naturally led him to become a legal historian, notably of 18th-century Ireland and of the law on slavery.  His publications reflected his meticulous attention to detail, conceptual rigour and clarity in writing. Land Law in Ireland (first published in 1994 and now in its fourth edition) has become the leading student textbook on the topic.  As first conceived, it demonstrated his socio-legal perspective, including chapters on planning and development and housing law. Later works reflected the turn towards legal history, notably Irish Exchequer Reports 1716-1734 (2009). He was also the author of Granville Sharp's Cases on Slavery (2017) and (with John Bergin) of The Acts of James II's Irish Parliament (2016).  He was awarded an LLD by the University of London in 1996 for his work on the law of East Africa and on Irish land law. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (2018). He developed a course in African law (later legal anthropology), delving more deeply into some topics broached in land law, and he long aspired to offer a course on the legal protection of cultural property.  While this never came to pass during his time in UCD, he would be pleased to see that this is now a major focus within UCD Sutherland School of Law's research. Andrew graduated with an LLB from University College London in 1966. He then went to East Africa with Voluntary Service Overseas and held several academic posts at University of East Africa (University of Dar es Salaam after 1970). He obtained an LLM there in 1973. He became an advocate of the High Court of Tanzania in 1971 and was called to the Bar at Gray's Inn, London in 1979.  Andrew was deeply impressed by the optimism and collective ambition he found in recently independent Tanzania.  This was reflected in his lifelong commitment to equality, the right of all to dignity and respect, human rights and social justice and his role in the Irish anti-apartheid movement. Andrew was a valued and much-loved colleague, whose many friends throughout UCD and across the world will remember him fondly. (October 6th, 1942-February 11th, 2021)  JOHN O'DOWD"

This week the offbeat financial guru predicts that so called 'meme' stocks, pumped up by organised groups on social media (GameStop famously went up 1,900pc) are set to crash and burn. A wary Wall Street pays careful attention to Burry, who says he has Asperger's Syndrome. Big international firms live in fear of his tweets since Burry emerged as one of a tiny group of investors that not only predicted the international banking collapse, but put also serious skin in the game and made a fortune from it. Burry's hedge fund, Scion Capital, shorted (bet against) the housing market for huge money. Such was the belief in the solidity of the big banks that numerous clients of Burry's completely flipped when they learned of the extent of the short he was making on their behalf and wanted their money out. Burry's 'big short' made him a personal fortune of US(EURO)100m and an estimated collective profit for his investor clients of (EURO)700m. Those who have seen the excellent movie The Big Short will recall Christian Bale's Oscar nominated performance as the guru who blasted death metal music and beat his desk with drumsticks while he worked. Michael Burry later stated that anyone could have figured that a big crash was coming based on simple analysis of the mortgage market from 2003 onwards and what was new in it. While economists make the mistake of predicting outcomes on the basis of what has gone before, Burry instead focused on what was wholly new. In 2007 it was a whole slew of financial securities products which mingled bad subprime loans in with lower risk loans. Burry and a small group of others, realised that the repackaging of subprime loans into collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) - with AAA credit ratings - would eventually lead to them bombing, collapse the world's biggest banks, and in turn the housing markets. In Ireland, the financial crisis here was worsened by the fiscal ineptitude of a succession of Fianna Fáil-led Governments. While Michael Burry was shorting the housing market, our then Government was pouring petrol on it. The Minister for Finance drastically reduced stamp duty, and maintained ridiculously favourable tax reliefs for residential development in times of heated prices. This artificially channelled investment into home building to cause a surplus (especially in apartments) to the degree that we were building homes to house the people coming here to build them. Combined with the flagrant lending of international banking, Ireland's property market fell further into the abyss than most. In Dublin 4, luxury homes which routinely sold for (EURO)12m in 2006 could be got for (EURO)2.2m four years later. All that has changed now. Last week it was revealed that a Shrewsbury Road home had sold for (EURO)11m in an off-market deal. And earlier this week, this newspaper revealed that house price inflation in Ireland has now reached levels not seen since the Celtic Tiger. The Irish Independent/ Real Estate Alliance (REA) report shows average home values rose by more than 4pc nationally in the last quarter. Increases of 1pc plus per month were typical pre-crash. However, since the last property crash, banks have largely been restricted in what they can lend. So anyone looking for a cause for the next property downturn in Ireland, should take a leaf out of Michael Burry's book and look at what's new around here since the last crash. For the last few years, aside from shorting Tesla (reputedly for $530m) and investing heavily in water, Burry has been telling anyone who will listen that ""passive investing"" is creating an international bubble. Passive investing, which has grown from strength to strength in recent years, involves investing for the long haul, often through index funds and defined formulas. Real estate is one of the prime targets of passive investors. If we take Burry's approach and look out for what is new in this cycle in Ireland, the latest arrivals on the block are the 'Cuckoo funds' busy hoovering up apartment blocks and, more recently, entire phase new house schemes. Who needs banks to throw money about for housing when you have huge funds like these to do it? Overseas investors through funds accounted for 78pc of more than (EURO)5bn pumped into commercial and residential property here from 2017 to 2018. Fund and institutional investment in Europe's residential property market hit an all-time record in 2020 with the top five funds investing as estimated (EURO)216bn in just one year. We have recently seen unrest in Sweden, Germany (Berlin), Poland and, of course, here in Ireland due to funds buying up vast chunks of residential property normally bought by punters. The complaints in other countries are the same as ours. Cuckoo funds are creating their own market momentum by excluding regular homebuyers and inflating prices. This in turn creates another market - those who can't buy homes will ultimately have to rent from them. The funds are drivers of rent increases and of capital value increases, especially when in competition with local authorities also buying up properties. At the same time, the biggest chunk of investment money coming into Ireland under the Immigrant Investor Programme (IIP) is being pumped into Irish social housing. RTE recently highlighted a spend of (EURO)249m by non-EU investors, funding the development of 3,750 social homes here. Most of these investors are from China. So the Americans and Chinese are among the biggest buyers of residential homes in Ireland today? As investors? Once again, that's pretty new isn't it? And if you told someone five years ago that the housing minister would be considering rules to allow ordinary couples the right to buy 50pc of homes being built here, you'd think that was new alright. And the big funds keep on buying. As they are structured, they have to - they are great big home-buying machines hoovering the globe on autopilot. So is it reasonable to ask whether the big spending funds might be new banks in the current equation? And might the sweetheart tax deals by Government for the big funds turn out to be the Tiger-era Section 23 'petrol' of our time? If we have learned anything from Burry, we can't afford to be passive this time out. Might the sweetheart tax deals by Government for the big funds be the new Section 23 'petrol' on a fast heating market Graphic   Marching to his own beat: Maverick hedge fund manager Michael Burry as portrayed by Christian Bale in The Big Short; Burry was one of the few to predict that subprime home loans would crash the global economy"

Auctioneer Sherry FitzGerald's finding backs up two further reports in the past week showing how pent-up demand, low interest rates and record savings are pushing up house prices by (EURO)100 a day. Ireland's largest estate agent reported that the 'ongoing supply constraints' continue to fuel the price inflation and its boss Marian Finnegan said 'our housing supply crisis is particularly acute'. The average value of secondhand homes in Ireland increased by 3% in April, May and June, with values rising 4.6% since the beginning of the year. This compares to an increase of just 0.1% to the first half of 2020 as the pandemic shut down the economy. In Dublin, prices increased by 2.1% in April, May and June, and have grown 3.1% in total since the start of the year. This is a huge increase compared to last year, when values remained unchanged in the opening six months. Average values have now increased 3.7% in the capital over the past 12 months. The rate of inflation remains stronger outside of Dublin, with average values increasing 4.2% in April, May and June and 6.6% over the first six months of the year. Ms Finnegan said that the lockdown had contributed to the sudden surge in demand. She said: 'The recent levels of heightened price inflation are primarily a result of diminished stock levels, exacerbated by the national lockdowns. That said, other factors such as increased savings have also played a role. With the lifting of restrictions, an uptick in both construction activity and homes being brought to the market has been noted. However, the market remains substantially out of kilter and further increases in supply will be needed before the rate of inflation begins to moderate.' The strong momentum continued into the opening three months of the year, with almost 12,000 home sales recorded, which is a 7% increase on the same period last year. Due to the time lag in adding properties to the Property Price Register, the figures from the first three months of the year are the most accurate available. In Dublin, almost 3,500 homes sold, a 2% rise on the first three months of 2020. The Sherry FitzGerald report said: 'Activity in Cork was particularly strong, with sales up 7% year-on-year. In the other regional centres, activity in Limerick remained steady, while there was a fall of 5% in Galway year-on-year. New home sales to the private market fell noticeably in the first three months of 2020, 10% year-on-year. However, much of this can be accounted for the significant volume of new homes acquired for social housing. 'Activity in the second-hand market was much more robust increasing 10% year-on-year... In terms of the profile of purchasers, owner occupiers remained the primary purchasing cohort, representing 78% of all purchasers with Sherry FitzGerald in the first half of 2021. Although there was a minimal increase in the proportion of investors purchasing property compared to the first six months of 2020, there continues to be a substantial mismatch between the volume of investors entering and exiting the market.' Almost a third of sellers were investors selling up, while just 14% of buyers were investors buying a property. While rental inflation has moderated, it is likely to be temporary as demand for accommodation will increase with the further reopening of the economy in the months ahead, Sherry FitzGerald said. Ms. Finnegan added: 'There has been a striking uplift in demand for housing across the globe. As such, the recent appreciation in the pace of house price inflation is not unique to Ireland, indeed double-digit growth has been recorded across many developed housing markets. That said, our housing supply crisis is particularly acute.' christian.mccashin@dailymail.ie Leo says Sinn Féin sparks 'FURY' FOR ITS SOCIAL MEDIA SINN Féin deliberately unleashes 'aggression, nastiness, fury and anger' in the Dáil so that it can post videos of it on social media, the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said during a heated debate yesterday. 'The constant display, every Thursday of aggression, nastiness, fury and anger is all preplanned for the purposes of the social media video he proposes to put out in a few minutes or an hour's time. Everyone knows that,' he said during a clash with Sinn Féin's Pearse Doherty during Leaders' Questions yesterday. Mr Doherty had been attacking the Government for excluding apartments from new rules designed to curb the bulk purchasing of homes. He said, the 'policy choice the Tánaiste and his Government made says to workers and families that this Government is not on their side, but on the side of the funds, developers and banks'. Mr Varadkar then snapped back that Sinn Féin staged its outrage for social media clicks. 'Deputy Doherty said that I need to get real. He needs to calm down,' he said.

In his annual report for last night's AGM, Barr, who now steps aside to allow Tom Parsons take over as CEO, said: ""When I see the significant revenue generated by the intercounty games, I am surprised by the focus often on the 'unsustainability' of inter-county costs. ""I find it difficult to square the two. Could we all be more efficient and effective with our investments and expenditure? Undoubtedly. ""Are costs associated with inter-county games 'unsustainable'? That's a far more nuanced question to answer so let's look at the revenue generated in 2019 v 2020. ""In 2019, with a thriving inter-county game, the GAA generated record revenues, 83 cent in every euro of which was invested back into schools, clubs, counties and provinces. ""In 2020, revenues generated by the inter-county game fell off a cliff due to Covid-19 and GAA units across the country and overseas were left with little to no investment. ""The money spent on the inter-county game is not a cost - it's an investment, an investment that all units of the GAA benefit from. ""Let's see where savings can be made but let's be careful about what we wish for at the same time. ""And where we are not getting a return for the investment, let's make those savings."" Barr also expressed other concerns, adding: ""The inter-county game cannot thrive without the club game, the club game cannot thrive without the inter-county game. ""What has surprised me since my arrival at the GPA is the insistence among some commentators to try and drive a wedge between the two."" At last night's AGM, Carlow footballer Maria Kinsella and Wexford hurler Matthew O'Hanlon were elected as co-chairs of the newly-structured GPA, which merged with the Women's GPA last December. Financially, due to operating costs dropping 52 per cent because of the pandemic, the GPA reported a surplus of (EURO)467,289 for 2020, compared to (EURO)87,674 for 2019.

Ciaran Barr is now the GPA’s Head of Operations and Finance but offered his personal opinion on how the historical divide could be bridged or narrowed further. With a few exceptions at club level – and an honourable mention to Antrim ladies of the past – hurling and camogie have been dominated by southern sides. Belfast native Barr, who went on to win a Dublin hurling crown with St Vincent’s, believes that drilling in skills is the most important element: “This is my personal opinion, this comes back to coaching. An investment in coaching at grassroots level. The GPA is part of the mechanism that allows just the GAA, not the two other NGBs [National Governing Bodies, the LGFA and Camogie Association], generate €75 million of revenue in a normal year. Now that money does get distributed right across the board to every county. “The GAA has been doing a relatively good job, as has Camogie and Ladies’ Gaelic Football, in trying to increase the level of investment in coaching from the bottom up. That’s the long-term game. In my opinion, the only game. “This is not about facilities. It’s not about infrastructure. It has to start with coaching at the youngest level. That’s what will make the difference. And that’s really hard to do. “Unfortunately, hurling is a relatively complex skilled game so we need ‘experts’ to get it right at the very beginning. And if you get that right, you get the production of really good highly-skilled players at the other end. “That transfer of resources and maybe in a sense, that technology of hurling, the engineering of hurling and camogie, that could be transferred from where it’s really rich with lots of resources to where it needs to be put. “For me that’s the issue, that’s the problem. How do you incentivise this transfer of skill from the rich skilled counties like Kilkenny, Tipp, Cork, Galway etcetera, Wexford – all the traditional ones that have loads of hurling and camogie tradition – to where it doesn’t exist?” Barr recalled his personal experience of how knowledgeable individuals can make a massive difference: “There’s little examples of it where you see clubs and teams doing well out of the blue. And people go, oh it’s because a fella… moved from Kilkenny to Dunloy. There’s a guy that came up. And there was one man or one woman who brought the intellectual property with him that changed the dynamic. “I’ll give you a real example. When I was at school, St Finian’s on the Falls Road never played hurling, [just] Gaelic football. Four De La Salle brothers from Kerry. Caherciveen. “I went to St Mary’s Christian Brothers on the Glen Road and it was two Tipperary and a Cork Christian Brother – the hurling coaches were the Tipperary and the Cork guys. “I started playing hurling at 11, but my first coaches were a Tipp brother and a Cork brother. “So you couldn’t have had better coaches to teach you how to play hurling correctly. The transfer of intellectual property. Simple. There’s the answer. But th at’s really, really hard to do.” Asked about the huge levels of games development funding still going to Dublin, Barr replied: “It’s a more complicated equation than simply looking at the amount of money invested absolutely in a county. In my view, you always have to look at the relative per capita amount that’s been invested. “If in 2040 the population and its density and its spread has changed significantly, we’re going to be having the same conversation if we stick with the old model and the old ways of doing things. “There will have to be an increase in the coaching in urban centres if the population grows in those areas. It’s a simple fact. “It’s not an equalisation driven by labels saying Antrim, Down, Kerry, Cork, but an equalisation of where the population is and where the requirement is.”"

Mr Martin has pointed out that governing parties seldom fare well in by-elections, and this is largely true. It is, perhaps, even more so the case at a time when there is deep frustration among the public a year-and-a-half into the Covid-19 pandemic, which has once again flared. The Coalition's management of the country's emergence from the pandemic, in the face of the new Delta variant of the virus, now takes on added significance. The stability of the Government will rely even more on this issue in the aftermath of the by-election. However, there are deeper issues for the Government to also consider, not least in relation to housing and the general sense of anger and disillusionment experienced by many younger people. The by-election winner, Ivana Bacik, is to be congratulated on her notable success. She was by far the most impressive candidate in the contest. After a long career in national politics as a senator, and considerable achievement as a liberal campaigner for social rights and equality, Ms Bacik's time has clearly come. She will be a genuine addition to Dáil Éireann. Her victory is shared by the Labour Party, the oldest political party in the State, which has experienced significant setbacks in recent elections. Labour's contribution to the State has also been considerable, and this success is well deserved. Ms Bacik's success is also a victory for constructive centrist politics and there may well be a lesson in that for all the parties in Leinster House. Pragmatic centrist parties will be required to work together to form future stable governments. The by-election outcome may now lead to an outbreak of internal party political in-fighting in the three Coalition parties, particularly Fianna Fáil. Fine Gael and the Greens will also undergo much soul-searching. It is doubtful the leadership of Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan will be threatened at this stage. Both are likely to lead Fine Gael and the Greens into the next general election, whenever that may be. The same cannot be said for Fianna Fáil. Once an arch-party of the centre of the political landscape in Ireland, Fianna Fáil has fallen mightily from that lofty position. The blame for this cannot be entirely laid at the feet on Micheál Martin, no more than fault for the party's by-election drubbing can be entirely apportioned to leader aspirant Jim O'Callaghan. However, the country can ill afford a bout of Fianna Fáil infighting. Mr Martin is scheduled to lead the country for the next 18 months. There is much to contend with, not least the management of the pandemic. There will be ample opportunity for Fianna Fáil to consider its future when Mr Martin transitions with the Fine Gael leader and Mr Varadkar is appointed Taoiseach. In the meantime, and after that transition, too, there is no shortage of work for the Government to get on with. The management of the economy and the task of rebuilding the country lie ahead. These challenges are great. The Government, the three parties to the Coalition - and their leaders - will be judged on how they rise to these challenges in the months and years ahead."
52,52,/home/paultrust/Downloads/Files(415)/Battle of Dublin Bay is already causing ripples.DOCX,The Irish Times,2021-07-13,1473 words,IRELAND; Pg. 6,Declan Walsh,NA,Behind the front lines: How guerrilla fighters routed Ethiopia's powerful army; Feud between prime minister Abiy Ahmed and Tigrayan leaders erupted into war last November,FALSE,"The Tigrayan fighters whooped, whistled and pointed excitedly to a puff of smoke in the sky where an Ethiopian military cargo plane trundling over the village minutes earlier had been struck by a missile. Smoke turned to flames as the stricken aircraft broke in two and hurtled toward the ground. Later, in a stony field strewn with smoking wreckage, villagers picked through twisted metal and body parts. For the Tigrayan fighters, it was a sign. ""Soon we're going to win,"" said Azeb Desalgne, a 20-year-old with an AK-47 over her shoulder. The downing of the plane on June 22nd offered bracing evidence that the conflict in the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia was about to take a seismic turn. A Tigrayan guerrilla army had been fighting to drive out the Ethiopian military for eight months in a civil war marked by atrocities and starvation. Now the fight seemed to be turning in their favour. The war erupted in November, when a simmering feud between prime minister Abiy Ahmed and Tigrayan leaders, members of a small ethnic minority who had dominated Ethiopia for much of the three previous decades, exploded into violence.  Since then, the fighting has been largely hidden from view, obscured by communications blackouts and overshadowed by international outrage over an escalating humanitarian crisis. But during a pivotal week, I went behind the front lines with a photographer, Finbarr O'Reilly, and witnessed a cascade of Tigrayan victories that culminated in their retaking the region's capital and altered the course of the war. We saw how a scrappy Tigrayan force overcame one of the largest armies in Africa through force of arms and by exploiting a wave of popular rage. Going into the war, Tigrayans were themselves divided, with many distrustful of a governing Tigrayan party seen as tired, authoritarian and corrupt. But the catalogue of horrors that has defined the war - massacres, ethnic cleansing and extensive sexual violence - united Tigrayans against Abiy's government, drawing highly motivated young recruits to a cause that now enjoys widespread support. ""It's like a flood,"" said Hailemariam Berhane, a commander, as several thousand young men and women, many in jeans and sneakers, marched past en route to a camp for new recruits. ""Everyone's coming here.""  'To hell and back' Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 and has staked his prestige on the Tigray campaign, has downplayed his losses. In a self-assured address to parliament on Tuesday of a kind that once dazzled admiring Westerners, Abiy insisted that his military's retreat from Tigray was planned  - the latest phase of a fight the government was on course to win. Seen from the ground, though, Tigray has been slipping through his fingers. In the past three weeks, Tigrayan fighters have captured a wide swath of territory; retaken the regional capital, Mekelle; and imprisoned at least 6,600 Ethiopian soldiers - and claimed to have killed about three times as many.  In recent days, Tigrayan leaders have expanded the offensive to new parts of the region, vowing to stop only when all outside forces have been expelled from their land: Ethiopians, allied troops from the neighbouring country of Eritrea and ethnic militias from the next-door Amhara region of Ethiopia. ""If we have to go to hell and back, we'll do it,"" said Getachew Reda, a senior Tigrayan leader. Press officers for Abiy and the Ethiopian military did not respond to questions for this article. We flew into Mekelle on June 22nd, a day after national elections in Ethiopia that had been heralded as a major step toward the country's transition to democracy.  In Tigray, though, there was no voting, and the Ethiopian military had just launched a sweeping offensive intended to crush for good the Tigrayan resistance, now known as the Tigray Defence Forces, commanders on both sides said.  In the countryside, the war was moving at a furious pace. Ethiopian military positions fell like dominoes. Hours after the Tigrayans shot down the military cargo plane, we reached a camp holding several thousand newly captured Ethiopian soldiers, about 50km south of Mekelle. Heavy guns Clustered behind a barbed wire fence, the prisoners erupted into applause when we stepped from our vehicle  - hoping, they later explained, that we were Red Cross workers. Some were wounded, others barefoot - Tigrayans confiscated their boots as well as their guns, they said - and many pleaded for help. ""We have badly wounded soldiers here,"" said Meseret Asratu (29), a platoon commander.  Artillery boomed in the distance. The Tigrayan offensive was continuing to the north, using captured heavy guns against the Ethiopian troops who had brought them in. A platoon of fighters walked through, bearing a wounded man on a stretcher.  Teklay Tsegay watched them pass. Before the war, Teklay (20) was a mechanic in Adigrat, 110km north. Then, last February, Eritrean soldiers fired into his aunt's house, killing her five-year-old daughter, he said. The next day, Teklay slipped out of Adigrat to join the resistance. ""I never thought I would be a soldier,"" he said. ""But here I am.""  At the recruitment camp, instructors standing under trees gave speeches about Tigrayan culture and identity and taught new recruits to fire an AK-47. The wave of recruits has included doctors, professors, white-collar professionals and diaspora Tigrayans from the United States and Europe, colleagues and friends said.  Even in government-held Mekelle, recruitment grew increasingly brazen. Two weeks ago, a TDF poster appeared on a wall beside St Gabriel's, the city's largest church. ""Those who fail to join are as good as the walking dead,"" it read. Hours later, Ethiopian soldiers arrived and tore it down.  Mulugeta Gebrehiwot Berhe (61), a senior fellow at the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, in Massachusetts, was visiting Mekelle when war erupted in November. I found him near the town of Samre, a leather-holstered pistol on his hip. ""I joined the resistance,"" said the academic, who once helped broker a peace deal for the United Nations in Darfur. ""I felt I had no other option.""  Even some Ethiopian commanders felt alienated by Abiy's approach to the conflict. Until late June, Col Hussein Mohamed, a tall man with a gold-tooth smile, commanded the 11th Infantry Division in Tigray. Now he was a prisoner, held with other Ethiopian officers in a closely guarded farmhouse. Of the 3,700 troops under his command, at least half were probably dead, said Hussein, confirming that he was speaking voluntarily.  ""The course of this war is political madness, to my mind,"" he said. He always had serious reservations about Abiy's military alliance with Eritrea, Ethiopia's old foe, he said: ""They ransack properties. They rape women. They commit atrocities. The whole army is unhappy about this marriage."" Still, Ethiopian soldiers have been accused of much the same crimes.  Even before Ethiopian forces abandoned Mekelle on June 28th, there were hints that something was afoot. The internet went down, and at the regional headquarters where Abiy had installed an interim government, I found deserted corridors and locked offices. Outside, federal police officers were slinging backpacks into a bus. Smoke rose from the Ethiopian National Defence Forces' headquarters in Mekelle - a pyre of burning documents, it turned out, piled high by detainees accused of supporting the TDF. Weeks earlier, Ethiopian intelligence officers had tortured one of them, Yohannes Haftom, with a cattle prod. ""We will burn you,"" Yohannes recalled them saying. ""We will bury you alive.""  But after he followed their orders to cart their confidential documents to the burn pit on June 28th, the Ethiopians set Yohannes free. Hours later, the first TDF fighters entered Mekelle, setting off days of raucous celebration.  The celebrations eventually reached the house where Getachew, the Tigrayan leader and TDF spokesperson, now descended from his mountain base, was staying. As the whiskey flowed, Getachew juggled calls on his satellite phone while a generator rattled in the background. Abiy had once been his political ally, even his friend, he said. Now the Ethiopian leader had cut the power and phone lines to Mekelle and issued a warrant for his arrest. Buoyed by victory, the guests excitedly discussed the next phase of their war in Tigray. One produced a cake with the Tigrayan flag that Getachew, sharing a knife with a senior commander, cut to loud cheers. For much of his career, he had been a staunch defender of the Ethiopian state. But the war made that position untenable, he said.  Now he was planning a referendum on Tigrayan independence. ""Nothing can save the Ethiopian state as we know it, except a miracle,"" he said. ""And I don't usually believe in them."" - New York Times "

From the moment it left his boot ? 50 yards out ? you knew it was going in. Audacious and ruthlessly executed. PEDRI (SPAIN) I WILL pick a player I've seen live, and this lad took my breath away. I couldn't stop watching him. Is he really 18? I'll say it now, he's a future Ballon d'Or winner. RAHEEM STERLING (ENGLAND) I DIDN'T want him in the team, based on his form of last season, and I was far from alone in that thinking. Hasn't he proven all of us wrong? A role model, on and off the park. THAT, free of the tactical constraints of the super managers at club level, international football can be a joy to behold ? I believe that is why we've seen so many crazy, wonderful games. ITALY celebrating with their supporters after the semi-final win at Wembley. To think, Roberto Mancini was worried they might not have much backing. It felt like Rome transported. BILLY GILMOUR (SCOTLAND) OK, I knew of him and knew he was good, but I didn't realise he was that good. To come in for his first Scotland start and boss that game against England was sensational. I can't wait to see him play again. DIOGO JOTA (PORTUGAL) ONLY because I tipped him to be top scorer and in the running for player of the tournament.

SIMON KJAER (DENMARK, RIGHT) THE Denmark captain's response and leadership in the wake of Christian Eriksen's collapse in their opening game against Finland was truly inspiring. VAR can operate effectively and inconspicuously without all the nonsense we have to put up with the Premier League. THE 10th minute of Denmark's game against Belgium in Copenhagen when the game was stopped to pay tribute to Christian Eriksen. He had teammates on both sides which made it all the more poignant. JEREMY DOKU (BELGIUM, RIGHT) THE teenage winger from Rennes came in for Eden Hazard in the quarter-final against Italy, and looks a sensational prospect. KYLIAN MBAPPE (FRANCE) NEVER got going in the tournament and looked way off his game long before his missed penalty against the Swiss.

RAHEEM STERLING (ENGLAND) HAS been inspired during the Euros and every contribution has been absolutely vital. He's the main reason England reached last night's final. AN honour shared among all those who helped save the life of Christian Eriksen. REFEREES are not all bad and VAR can work without all the fuss and controversy. Referees have shown how it should be done. Not blown up every time a player falls and let games flow. A lesson for the Premier League. THE celebration from Hungary's Attila Fiola when he hurdled a barrier and then scared the life out of commentator Edit Szalay, trashing her workstation in his euphoria of scoring against France. LEONARDO SPINAZZOLA (ITALY) WHAT a player he has looked during the Euros. A relentless force down Italy's left. Tournament cruelly ended by injury in the quarter-finals. BRUNO FERNANDES (PORTUGAL) CENTRAL and undroppable at Manchester United, very underwhelming for Portugal. Benched after two starts. BUKAYO SAKA (ENGLAND) THE Arsenal man has seemingly kept spirits high in the England camp. I'd take his biggest fan with me as well, pundit Ian Wright.

MANUEL LOCATELLI (ITALY v SWITZERLAND) PLAYED a fabulous pass to Domenico Berardi, then hared into the box to tap in when Berardi cut it back. PEDRI (SPAIN) WHAT a tournament for the 18-year-old Spain midfielder, who ? health permitting ? should be a global star for at least the next decade. SIMON KJAER (DENMARK) THE captain gave Eriksen CPR on the pitch before medics arrived, and then comforted the playmaker's partner as he fought for his life. THIS format is ridiculous ? like organising a kids' tournament where some teams play at their local park, but others have to walk several miles in their boots to each match. Thank goodness it will be scrapped. AS France's campaign fell apart against Switzerland, Adrien Rabiot's mother Veronique traded insults in the stands with the families of Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe. Wonderful stuff. MIKKEL DAMSGAARD (DENMARK) HOW could such a gifted playmaker spend so many games last season on the bench at Sampdoria? That is surely about to change.

PATRIK SCHICK (LEFT) (CZECH REP v SCOTLAND) PAUL POGBA'S against Switzerland runs this close but scoring from 50 yards ? wow. RAHEEM STERLING (ENGLAND) ELECTRIC throughout the tournament.

DECLAN RICE trying to join in the celebrations after Harry Kane scored the second against Germany? only to collapse in a heap due to cramp.

RAHEEM STERLING (ENGLAND) HE'S been absolutely brilliant. There's nothing wrong with debating a player's form ? and there were valid questions ? but the young man is as hard as nails. His response has been emphatic. THE doctors who saved Christian Eriksen's life. We have had a brilliant month of football but could you imagine how this tournament would have been had Eriksen slipped away in front of us? NOT so much learned but had something reinforced: never make assumptions in football, never write off teams on the basis of reputation. THE noise that accompanied England's goals against Germany. It was raucous, it was frantic, there were arms and legs everywhere but, heaven knows, it was brilliant to see a football stadium come to life again.

Plastic surgeon Yasmin Ismail gives us 10 great tips to stay safe when we're in the outdoors",FALSE,"s Covid restrictions ease, the days getting longer and the sun shining, many of us are spending more time outdoors. A Most people living in Ireland have a skin type that can burn easily and tan poorly, so we are particularly at risk from too much sun exposure. This can result in sun damage leading to skin cancer or precancerous changes in the skin. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland with over 13,000 cases diagnosed every year. This is expected to double by 2040. We are also seeing more people with skin cancer presenting at a younger age, which is quite worrying. So, whether your staycation will be spent on the balcony, back garden or beach, it is vital you take care of your skin. 1Check the label for an SPF of at least 30 There are many different types of rays in sunlight but those that are most damaging to our skin are called ultraviolet rays (UVR) and specifically ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB). When choosing a sunscreen from the array of choices in your local pharmacy or shop, it is important you choose one that has good protection from both these rays. This means an SPF of at least 30 (preferably 50) to protect from UVB rays and UVA protection of at least four stars. These sunscreens are classed as broad spectrum. UVB rays burn the skin while UVA rays cause damage and aging. So remember, protecting yourself can be great for yasmin Ismail, your skin in the long run too. plastic surgeon Beacon 2 Children need higher protection Children have skin that is more sensitive than that of adults so they need a higher lever of protection. This means an SPF of 50+ should be applied regularly and liberally. Babies under the age of six months should be kept in the shade away from direct sunlight. 3Apply lots of sunscreen and often You should apply sunscreen liberally to your body and face about 20 minutes before going out in the sun. Don't forget a top-up at least every few hours, even if the label promises longer protection. Remember, sunscreen should never be used to extend the time you spend in the sun. 4 Reapply if you sweat or the sunscreen rubs off If you are swimming, exercising, sweating or towel drying, make sure to reapply the sunscreen more often to keep yourself safe. When it comes to sunscreen, less is definitely not more. 5Don't forget those cloudy days We often think we are only at risk of burning or sun damage when it is really sunny outside. However, the reality is that 80pc of UV rays can get through the clouds so we need to wear sunscreen on those dull and overcast days. Try to get into the habit of doing this every day and all year round. 6Sunscreen is not a suit of armour While sunscreen is great protection, it is unfortunately not enough to keep us completely safe. We can't forget to wear loose cotton clothing to cover the skin of the body and a widebrimmed hat that will help to keep the sun away from the face, back of the neck and ears. These are really sensitive areas that can burn easily. The eyes are also at risk of damage so make sure to wear sunglasses with good built in UV protection. 7 Clothes, sunglasses and hats are also vital for children Our children should also be protected with wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses and loose clothes. It is often easy to forget certain areas like the scalp or miss others with sunscreen even when applied liberally, so these other types of protection are important for children as they have such sensitive skin. 8Shade can be your saviour All of the protective measures are essential, but the best way to keep safe is to find some shade, particularly between 11am and 4pm when the sun is strongest. This applies to children and adults. 9 Take proper care of sun burns If you do get sunburn, it is important to get out of the sun as soon as possible and cool the skin with a cold shower, bath or damp towel. This will also help to relieve the pain. You should apply aftersun cream or spray such as aloe vera to soothe the skin and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration. If needed, you can take a painkiller or over-the-counter antihistamine to relieve the symptoms of pain and itch. Speak to your pharmacist about this. consultant at the Hospital And critically, take extra care to cover sunburned skin from direct sunlight until it has fully healed. 10Look out for changes on the skin So now that we know how to keep safe, we should also be sure we know how to check ourselves for any worrying signs of skin cancer. There are different types of skin cancer, but the most common all start in the upper layers of the skin and result from sun exposure and sunburns from childhood or early adulthood. Remember, many occupations including farming, fishing, and construction put you at risk of exposure, as do some hobbies such as gardening or golf. It is important to look out for crusty patches, ulcers, sores or lumps over the skin which fail to heal. Similarly, changes in moles or new moles warrant attention and this can come in the form of change in colour, size and shape. You may notice symptoms such as itching, bleeding or pain. Also, get in the habit of checking yourself regularly. The best thing you can do if you notice any changes is to see your GP. They may arrange a biopsy or refer you to a specialist and if you are diagnosed, there are a variety of treatments, including surgery. While protection is always better than treatment, time is of the essence as over 90pc of skin cancers are curable if diagnosed early. Early treatment can also be life saving.

Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien yesterday announced provisions for rent increases in Rent Pressure Zones will be capped in line with inflation from mid-July. A ban on evictions of struggling tenants has also been put in place for the rest of the year under a set of new laws due to come into effect on July 19. Previously, landlords of houses in RPZs could not increase rents by more than four per cent a year. However, this will now be replaced with annual rent hikes linked to general inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices - a model followed by many EU countries. The Housing Minister yesterday claimed that this transformed scheme will result in far lower rent increases for the estimated 74 per cent of all tenancies in RPZs. Expl aining the new measures, he said: ""If you look at inflation over the last three years, that averages around 0.73 per cent per annum - so just under onequarter of one per cent. ""So instead of a four per cent increase that some tenants would have borne because that was the maximum - the maximum over the last three years would have been under one per cent. ""Currently, inflation is running a bit higher than that but we are still looking at about 1.9 per cent. ""This is a measure used in continental Europe frequently. I've listened to the advice of academics in this area and indeed tenancy advocates. That is why I'm bringing through these changes."" However, Social Democrats TD Cian O'Callaghan claimed the changes have come too late - as rents are likely to continue to rise by around two per cent this year and then higher next year. The party's housing spokesperson said last night: ""The Government's plan to link rent increases to inflation is coming a decade too late. ""They have missed the boat. It's a policy for another era. Rents have almost doubled in the last ten years. Dublin rents are among the highest in the EU. ""The Government stood back and watched as their Rent Pressure Zones exploded - their solution now is to allow rents to continue to increase even more."" He added: ""Let's be clear - people cannot afford to pay more. What is needed now is a three-year ban on rent increases. We need rents to freeze and then fall. ""The Government's new policy will see rents increase by two per cent this year, but potentially more next year if the EU inflation index increases. This is a mistake."" Under the new legislation, RPZs will be extended until 2024. The rent controls, designed to temper the overheating rental market, were first brought in by Fine Gael in December 2016. But Sinn Fein housing spokesperson Eoin O Broin lashed out at the new controls. He said: ""The Minister's plans to keep the RPZ legislation in place, while limiting increases to inflation, will do little to help tenants already struggling with high rents. ""Furthermore, what about the 26 per cent of tenants who live outside Rent Pressure Zone areas? Those tenants will still be subject to the current system, which is deeply unfair. If this Government is serious about protecting renters, it will ban rent increases for three years."" Q&A WHAT ARE RPZs? A RENT Pressure Zone is a designated area where, at present, rents cannot be increased by landlords by more than four per cent per annum. They were introduced in 2016 to help curtail a sharp rise in rents. They are located in parts of the country where rents are highest and where households have the greatest difficulty finding affordable accommodation. WHERE ARE THE RPZs? There are six Local Authority Areas and 48 Local Electoral Areas designated as RPZs. They include all of Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and the majority of the country, with an estimated 74 per cent of all tenancies in RPZs. WHAT IS HARMONISED INDEX OF CONSUMER PRICES?

Thousands of people took to the streets on Sunday to protest at the lack of medical and food supplies - an unusual display of public discontent in a country that typically quashes dissent.  In a statement, Mr Biden lauded the Cuban people for ""bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights"". ""We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime,"" the president said.  Later he called on the Cuban regime to ""refrain from violence in their attempt to silence the voices of the people of Cuba"". In a television address yesterday, Cuba's president, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermudez - who replaced Raúl Castro as the country's leader in 2018 - accused Washington of stoking discontent, while also blaming the US trade embargo for causing supply shortages. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki hit back at suggestions that the US was to blame in any way for the events in Cuba. ""There's every indication that yesterday's protests were spontaneous expressions of people who are exhausted with the Cuban government's economic mismanagement and repression,"" she said. ""These are protests inspired by the harsh reality of everyday life in Cuba, not people in another country."" She also defended Mr Biden's Cuban policy, noting that the current economic sanctions on the country included exemptions for medical and humanitarian aid. The United States was ""closely engaged"" with the situation in Cuba, she said, and was ""looking to provide support to the people of Cuba"".  Asked if the US was prepared to send Covid-19 vaccines to the country amid a slow rollout of its vaccination programme, Ms Psaki noted that Cuba had not signed up to Covax, the global initiative that allows more developed countries to share vaccines with other countries. Cuban-American members of Congress from across the political spectrum spoke out in support of the protesters, while members of the Cuban community in Florida took to the streets in solidarity with the protesters. Mr Biden has faced criticism for not moving to reverse predecessor Donald Trump's stance towards Cuba by easing trade sanctions on the country. Mexico's president was among those who called on the US to lift its embargo on the island nation. In New York a spokesman for the United Nations said that the body was following developments in Cuba, but that ""freedom of expression and peaceful assembly"" needed to be fully respected. Haiti turmoil The eruption of political unrest in Cuba comes as the Biden administration is  grappling with political turmoil in Haiti following the assassination of the country's president last week. President Jovenal Moïse was shot dead in his home in an audacious attack, which has plunged the Caribbean country into uncertainty. More than two-dozen people have been arrested in connection with the assassination, including Colombian and US nationals. Police have said they believe that Christian Emmanuel Sanon, a Haitian doctor living in Florida, was the mastermind of the attack.

F Looking through a kid's eyes, the Meath team of that era were an intimidating lot, even threatening (but failing) to unseat the great Galway outfit that won the All-Ireland three-in-a-row from 1964 to '66. The Quinns, 'Red' Collier, Bertie Cunningham, Pat Reynolds, Peter Moore, Ollie Shanley - these were names that typified football royalty. When Mayo finally brought down Galway in 1967, it wasn't the Tribe's neighbouring rivals who won the All-Ireland, it was Meath. If Galway hadn't set such high standards, beating Meath in the 1964 semi-final and '66 final, the Royals might have had two more All-Irelands before decline set in after 1970. Except for their league title win in 1975, the 1970s were disappointing for Meath as they fell behind Offaly initially and later Dublin in Leinster. Into the 1980s and things got even worse as they lost first round games to Wexford and Longford. Better And, yet, there was something about them that hinted at better times ahead. Leaders like O'Rourke, McEntee, Hayes, Lyons and Cassells were all aboard and when others emerged, it gradually began to come together under Seán Boylan. Glory days followed and, as the titles rolled in, Meath's stock soared to its highest ever value. Good footballers, big hearts, hard men, who never took a backward step and never knew when they were beaten. When age broke up that group, O'Connell, Coyle and Dowd were young enough to remain and lead new talent. Now it was the turn of Giles, Fay, McDermott, Geraghty, Murphy, Reynolds etc to build a new Meath dynasty, which yielded two more All-Irelands in 1996 and '99. And when they started the 2001 All-Ireland final as hot favourites after demolishing Kerry by 15 points in the semi-final, Galway weren't seen a major threat. Yet, something happened on that September Sunday that changed the course of Royal history. Level at half-time, they lost the second half by 0-11 to 0-2. Meath were different from that day on - the famed mental hardness had disappeared and is still missing. One Leinster title, a success facilitated by a refereeing error in the final, is all they have to show from 19 championships. That's a cold, hard fact, but it doesn't tell the full story or their demise. One season in Division 1 since 2006 and, in a dysfunctional Leinster championship, they fell so far behind that they became mere green specks in Dublin's rear view mirror. That's the most damning of all. The county of bravehearts has been reduced to trembling wrecks in front of their neighbours. Granted, Dublin are statistically the best team of all time but Mayo, Kerry, Donegal and Tyrone have remained competitive against them. Not Meath, who have lost their last four championship games with Dublin by an average of 16 points. An unsuccessful Division 2 campaign this year did nothing to suggest Meath were becoming better equipped to deal with Dublin, but then other factors are at work which gives Sunday's clash a different complexion. Or at least it should, if Meath have any pride left. Dublin can gloss over it as much as they want, but something isn't right. The manager declaring that he doesn't know what the precise situation is with the captain of eight years, points to utter dysfunction. How about a phone call? Are you coming back Stephen? Yes or no? I need a definitive www.answer.No one is bigger than the team. The unsettling impact of the Cluxton saga, other mysterious defections, plus injury concerns leave Dublin more vulnerable than at any time over the past decade. Meath have a lot of ground to make up, but this is an opportunity to make a real statement. Timid to the point of being limp against Dublin in recent years, they looked very much like a team without a shred of self-belief and no clue about how to build any. Recent events in Dublin should have changed that. Yes, the odds are still against Meath, but surely they will see this this as a chance to alter the dynamic between themselves and Dublin. If there's any Royal spirit left, Sunday is the day to unlock it by delivering a performance which, at the very least, stretches Dublin all the way.

A group called Cloud Infrastructure Ireland has formed under Ibec, the business lobby, to argue against a moratorium on data centre connections and proposals from the utilities regulator to prioritise national grid access. The group includes Amazon and Google, heavy power users with a big presence in Ireland.  ""A moratorium on processing data centre applications in Dublin is the least desirable of the current options under consideration,"" Cloud Infrastructure said in a submission to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Its intervention comes one month after the regulator warned of ""consumers facing rolling blackouts"" if the current system for connecting data centres to the grid were not changed.  With two big power stations closed for repairs that will take months to complete, anxiety about the risk to power supplies when demand peaks in winter has already prompted Government moves to provide emergency power generation in Dublin from the autumn.  The regulator has said data centres are the biggest driver of all demand for electricity, adding that they were seeking to grow their power load at a rate unprecedented in Ireland. The annual increase in demand in the last four years was equivalent to adding 140,000 households to the power system each year.  Doing nothing was not an option because it would lead to demand outstripping supply, the regulator argued, but added that a moratorium was not appropriate ""at this time"" because alternative mechanisms were available. Amsterdam has stopped issuing permits for data centres in certain parts of the city because of grid concerns and Singapore imposed a moratorium on new centres in 2019.  Instead of a moratorium, the regulator wants connections to the grid prioritised according to the ability of each data centre to bring on generation and/or storage equal or greater to their demand. It also wants connection to be based on the centre's ability to provide flexibility in demand by cutting consumption when asked.  Challenges  Although big tech companies agreed that action was needed to resolve transmission constraints and security of supply challenges, they have come out against the regulator's grid prioritisation measures.  ""The consultation proposes that data centres should invest in dispatchable generation (eg, natural gas) to receive new grid connections,"" Cloud Infrastucture said in its submission.  ""[Our] members are willing to invest in new generation, but we strongly prefer targeting those investments to renewable energy and allowing the auction and market mechanisms to procure necessary balancing, firming and peaking resources from the market."" The group argued that a related proposal to determine grid access based on location ""within a constrained region or unconstrained region"" should be ranked as a low-priority criterion.  ""This would severely restrict investments in expanding existing Dublin-based data centres, at a time when demand for digital services is growing,"" it said.  ""These data centres should still have the option to grow their existing sites in response to demand from their customers.  ""Closing the door to existing sites by deprioritising constrained regions would be unfair to existing operators and could limit Dublin's ability to respond to growing demand for cloud services. It is also unclear to [Cloud Infrastructure] what areas are considered constrained and where available capacity may exist."""

That's the land area of The Netherlands. It's also the amount of forest lost around the world in 10 years of biofuel production. That is the claim being made by environmental think-tank, Transport & Environment (T&E) which is calling on the EU to end subsides and backing for biofuels. You are likely already burning biofuel in your car. All unleaded petrol on sale in Ireland conforms to the EU's current E5 regulation, which blends a 5 per cent mix of anhydrous ethanol - an alcohol-type fuel distilled from plants - into the fuel. Diesel mostly conforms to the B7 regulation for a 7 per cent blend. The idea is that, because plants absorb carbon from the air around them as they grow, if you make ethanol from those plants, then the carbon emitted by burning it in an engine is in a closed-loop. You are simply returning carbon to the air, rather than extracting ancient carbon from the ground and burning that. E10 fuel - which allows for a 10 per cent ethanol mix - is now being rolled out. It's a nice idea (albeit one that ignores issues with emissions from producing and transporting the crops and the fuel itself - the EU does have systems in place that try to regulate those emissions too). But it has its staunch critics. Laura Buffet, energy director at T&E says: ""Ten years of this 'green' fuels law and what have we got to show for it? Rampant deforestation, habitats wiped out and worse emissions than if we had used polluting diesel instead. A policy that was supposed to save the planet is actually trashing it. We need to break the biofuels monopoly in renewable transport and put electricity at the centre of the Renewable Energy Directive instead."" Target  The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) was introduced in 2010, setting a 10 per cent renewable energy target for transport by 2020 for each EU member state. This, claims T&E, has driven up demand for cheap crop-based biodiesel, such as palm and soy oil, which is mainly sourced from Asia and South America and is reckoned to have contributed to roughly four million hectares of forests being razed.  Defending the use of biofuels, James Cogan, industry and policy adviser with Ethanol Europe, says that the problems highlighted by T&E are tarring all biofuels with one brush. ""This is a story about bad regulation,"" says Cogan. ""The European Commission created schemes to incentivise renewable energy but failed to make rules to distinguish between safe effective renewable energy and palm oil biodiesel. This is about palm oil and soy biodiesel specifically. It's not about all renewable energy or about all biofuels. This is a story about Europe offshoring its production to regions of the world where European standards are not upheld.  ""Increasing palm oil biodiesel is bad because more palm oil leads to more deforestation, in countries where conservation is not practised.  ""European demand for palm oil for biodiesel contributes significantly to deforestation and habitat loss. Palm oil supplies are closely interconnected so there's no such thing as 'sustainable palm oil' whether it's for biodiesel or for biscuits. Biofuels should be sourced from Europe where standards are upheld and where there is traceability."" Cogan says that no palm-based biofuels are used in Ireland, but that they do see heavy use in such nations as Italy, Germany, and France.  ""Ireland should demand better regulatory standards from Brussels,"" says Cogan. ""Palm oil is not the only bad apple in the barrel. Biodiesel made from used cooking oil is a great thing, so long as the used cooking oil is genuine. Much of it is not, due to weak regulation from Brussels.  ""In our company we make safe effective sustainable biofuel from EU farm crops. It is fully traceable back to the farm where the crops were grown. We are immensely proud of our sector and love to have policymakers and environmental groups visit our facilities and see how it all works."""

David Gunning, chief officer of the NPHDB, warned of 'inadvertently giving targets to the contractor that they look at with a great degree of desire to land'. Mr Gunning told the committee that contractor BAM has submitted 906 claims with a total value of (EURO)446million. 'Claims are a part of construction contracts. If the contractor considers that under the contract there should be an extension of time, or an adjustment to the contract sum, or that if the contractor has any other entitlements in connection with or under the contract, the contractor submits a claim,' he said. However, Mr Gunning said those costs are not guaranteed to be awarded to the contractor, and will be fought by the NPHDB. 'One of our main tasks, I would say, is defending each and every one of these claims,' he said, adding that 'the budget put in place' for the 'claims defence' was 'of the order of (EURO)15million'. He continued: 'We believe this money is well spent to save the State money longer term and defend each and every one of these claims.' A moratorium is currently in place on those claims, agreed by all stakeholders, with a view to focusing efforts on opening the National Children's Hospital in 2024 - some 14 months later than is set out in the contract. 'This does not remove the risk of claims, nor does it mean we will not continue to receive claims,' Mr Gunning said. The hospital, which is being built on the site of St James's Hospital in Dublin, has been beset by costs that have escalated to at least (EURO)1.433billion. The committee also heard that the coronairus pandemic and Brexit will place 'pressure on the availability of essential supplies', which will have a potential impact on the hospital project's cost and delivery timelines. 'Any elongation of the programme will lead to additional cost,' Mr Gunning said. TDs and senators criticised officials from the NPHDB and the Department of Health for their refusal to reveal the latest costs. Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy said the department had repeatedly provided cost updates in the past, including (EURO)800million in 2016, (EURO)983million in 2017 and (EURO)1.43billion in December 2019. 'Were you not cognisant of commercial sensitivities at that stage?' he asked. Fiona Prendergast, an official at the Department of Health, replied: 'At that stage, the contract either had not been signed, or we were in an early stage. 'We're midway through a contract with the main contractor, and it is not appropriate to now consider discussing this in open forum.' Mr Carthy responded: 'Do you have any idea how crazy that sounds? 'That you are able to give an estimated cost before and at the early stages of a project, but at the heart of the project, that has been severely delayed, commercial sensitivities mean the people who will be paying for this hospital, i.e. the taxpayers of Ireland, can't be informed as to what the potential maximum cost will be.' Ms Prendergast replied: 'It's very difficult to tell what the maximum cost will be given the uncertainties outlined by ourselves and Mr Gunning, in the context of Covid, Brexit, inflation, etc. There will be full and total accountability in relation to the cost of this hospital in due course.' news@dailymail.ie 'There'll be full accountability' 'This money is well spent'"

Champions Dublin lined out without All-Stars Sinéad Goldrick, Carla Rowe, Lyndsey Davey and Nicole Owens for their opening round 2-18 to 1-11 win against Tyrone, and Bohan says he has his hands full keeping the squad satisfied. 'They are a great group to deal with. They all want to play. It was actually funny the last couple of days trying to explain to people the process of this. I could see the eyes cutting into me on the bus on the way down, but sure that's the nature of the competitive group,' said Bohan. 'Some of the players we just have to be mindful of because within seven days they're out again. There's obviously people at different stages of their career.' First-half goals from Jennifer Dunne and Siobhan Killeen proved for the champions. Hannah Tyrrell continued her good scoring form for the reigning champions as she kicked seven points while Niamh O'Neill was in scintillating form for Tyrone, registering nine scores of her own in defeat. Dublin laid the foundations for victory after dominating the third quarter. Tyrrell converted her fourth free before Killeen and Niamh McEvoy both pointed, alongside scores from Dunne and Caoimhe O'Connor, all achieved while holding the Ulster side scoreless. Dublin were awarded a penalty when Dunne was fouled but McEvoy's spot kick was well saved by Tyrone goalkeeper Maeve Maxwell. In the final quarter, Niamh Hughes and Niamh O'Neill added to Tyrone's tally, but the final moments were all Dublin as they eased to a facile victory. Dublin will now secure their place in the quarterfinals with victory over Waterford in next weekend's Group 3 encounter, and in Group 2 Cork will aim to do likewise when they face Tipperary. Last year's runners-up were 1-9 to 0-10 winners against an impressive Meath side that was playing its first senior game following last year's intermediate success. Bríd O'Sullivan's goal just before the interval paved the way for Cork, who held on to win despite an impressive comeback from the Royals. 'The most important thing is the win,' said Cork manager Ephie Fitzgerald. 'We knew they are a good team and they have a system that's very difficult to break down. 'The character of the girls shone through, and they show it time after time and they needed it again there today when those few things went against them.' In the four-team Group 1, Mayo were 1-18 to 0-15 winners over Cavan, and Michael Moyles' side take on Monaghan next weekend. Rachel Kearns hit Mayo's goal, while seven Shauna Howley points meant the Ulster side were kept at arm's length, despite six Amy Rooney points in the second half. 'We're very pleased,' said Moyles. 'We were 11 players down and the young players carried the mantle and soaked up the pressure and did the right things - we have some very good, intelligent players coming through and that is a credit to the clubs and underage system.' Elsewhere, Kelly Mallon, Eve Lavery and Alex Clarke struck three quick goals in the second half as Armagh were impressive 4-17 to 1-12 winners over Monaghan. 'When we got going, we got our tails up and took some great scores so I am delighted with that,' said Armagh manager Ronan Murphy. And Galway manager Gerry Fahy admitted he was relieved to see his side claim victory after they fought off Kerry's late comeback to pick up a 2-11 to 2-10 win in Ennis. 'I didn't think we fired at all in the first half but in fairness to the players, they really did respond very well in the second half,' said Fahy. 'There was probably a couple of chances that we could have taken to make our lives a bit easier but the battling qualities of the team really shone out.' In the intermediate championship, Longford pulled off the shock of the weekend with their 3-11 to 2-11 victory over favourites Westmeath after extra-time. Sarah Dillon's late goal sent the game into the additional periods of play, but two points by Lauren Maguire gave Longford a fully deserved victory. Elsewhere, there were intermediate championship wins for Kildare over Roscommon, Natasha Ferris led the Down comeback over Offaly in their 3-14 to 2-14 win. Wexford cruised past Sligo with a 4-13 to 1-10 triumph while Leitrim had two late Michelle Guckian points to thank for their 1-12 to 1-11 win against Fermanagh.

Cattle and sheep prices increased by 10pc year to date, despite lower export volumes, new figures from Bord Bia show. Mark Zeig, Beef Sector Manager with Bord Bia, told a recent market outlook seminar that the total Irish cattle kill this year is expected to be back to 110,000 (6.2pc). In addition, a combination of lower carcase weights at home and reduced beef output in Ireland's key markets all point to increased demand for Irish meat exports. Chinese imports have helped sustain prices globally, keeping supplies tight. Mr Zeig said beef and lamb demand in China remains solid. Lower cattle numbers are expected across Europe into the back end of the year. This is likely to be mirrored in Ireland. However, market demand is forecast to remain strong during the second half of the year. While the past 12 weeks has seen some slowing in retail sales in key markets, overall sales remain 7pc higher than in 2019, and the re-opening of indoor dining is expected to drive demand during the back end of the year. Economy The positive outlook for beef sales in the autumn and into 2022 has been helped by the improved Covid-19 situation, and positive growth projections for the European economy. Growth of 4.2pc has been forecast for the EU in 2021, with 4.4pc expected for 2022. However, labour availability is becoming an issue for meat processors across Europe, and could potentially impact supplies to markets. The UK is already feeling the pinch, due to the adverse impact of Brexit and Covid. Potential labour shortages in food processing could have a big impact on food supply across Europe."

The move followed the endorsement by G20 finance ministers in Venice over the weekend of a landmark global tax deal reached by G7 nations last month to set a worldwide minimum rate and to overhaul taxing rights. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen yesterday said that the newly endorsed mechanism to allow more countries to tax large, highly profitable multinational companies may not be ready for consideration by lawmakers until spring 2022. She also said the G20 would try to bring the holdouts, including Ireland, which has a corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent, towards accepting the agreement, but added that their assent was not needed to move forward.  Developments  Ms Yellen and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe are to meet in Brussels today for a Eurogroup meeting at which the weekend's developments are likely to be discussed.  The European Commission had come under intense pressure from Ms Yellen to shelve its digital tax proposal, according to people familiar with the discussions. Brussels was due to put forward its proposals for the digital levy this week, but had pushed them back to July 20th. ""The commission is reflecting on how to support the historic G20 deal. In that context we are considering a possible postponement to the autumn of the detailed proposal on the digital tax,"" an official said. The official stressed the final decision had not yet been taken and would be subject to discussion when commission president Ursula von der Leyen meets Ms Yellen today. The US treasury secretary is expected to discuss the issue at a meeting with euro zone finance ministers. Disruption  The prospect of a delay was welcomed by Pascal Saint- Amans, head of tax administration at the OECD. ""The postponing of the EU digital levy is good news,"" he said. ""It is wiser indeed to wait for the deal to be finalised and not risk any disruption with ongoing complicated legislative processes."" Meanwhile, Ms Yellen yesterday signalled she will push multilateral development banks (MDBs) further away from fossil fuel projects, saying she would ask them to ""increase their climate ambition"" to support the Paris Agreement on carbon emissions reductions. Yellen told a news conference that development lenders including the World Bank needed to boost efforts to encourage more private-sector climate-friendly investment. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021, Reuters "

About 3,300 of them are to help soak up extra demand in a year of a record 84,526 CAO applications, coupled with the fiercest ever competition among school-leavers for highpoints courses. The package includes 440 new places in health sciences, such as nursing, pharmacy and medicine - where demand is up 15pc, 23pc and 20pc respectively as well as 450 in science subjects, 120 in education and 102 in law. There will also be a significant increase in capacity in media studies, extra places in veterinary and greater numbers in business. As well as those, there are 1,300 new places on courses to equip graduates to meet skills needs in the economy - in areas such as climate change - under a scheme known as the Human Capital Initiative, which Further and Higher Education Minister Simon Harris is bringing the package to Cabinet. At 9pc, the overall year-onyear rise in CAO applications is high, and reflects more demand from mature students and a more than doubling of demand from EU countries linked to Brexit. But many courses have seen an above average increase in demand, driven largely by expectations among school-leavers of high points linked to the dual option Leaving Cert 2021. Pressure for places on popular college courses has intensified since February. Latest CAO data confirms a final figure of 84,526 applications, up from 79,176 in February and from 77,831 in 2020. It means increased demand across a swathe of courses, over and above what was evident in the spring. As well as late applications, the data reflects the course preferences of 43,978 who changed their mind after February and of 5,729 who had not entered their choices in February. Most are pursuing an honours degree, with 77,356 first preferences for Level 8 courses, compared with 42,161 for ordinary degree/higher certificate (Level 7/6) courses. Notwithstanding the 20pc rise in first preferences for medicine, they are down a little since February, probably reflecting the results of the Health Professional Admissions Test (Hpat) aptitude test. Architecture, agriculture, veterinary, biological sciences, computing, arts, environment-related courses, social sciences and journalism are also among the areas with big surges in interest. One discipline showing a sharp rise since February is business, with more than 1,000 extra first preferences bringing the figure to 9,835. However, at 3pc, the increase in demand still lags behind the average. Law has taken a hit in popularity, with first preferences down 8pc on July 2020, to 2,930. While applications have grown since February, it was a small rise of 158, from 2,772. Meanwhile, teaching courses and those linked to transport are among those seeing a downturn in interest.

There are legacy arguments about land ownership, religious oaths, and such like, however the days of bishops manipulating government policy are long gone. But has one church in Ireland simply been replaced by another? As religious moralising dissipates, other forms of judgmentalism - and especially those allied to free-market economics - have become more dominant. Labour market researchers Tom Boland and Ray Griffin believe we need to wake up to the ""theology hidden in plain sight"".  Competition, productivity and individualism are something like a holy trinity today. According to Boland and Griffin, however, such contemporary values are, crucially, underpinned by a Judeo-Christian inheritance; in other words, the old church hasn't entirely gone away. The duo identify a distinctly religious flavour to various secular rites in the labour market. Having a job isn't enough, you need a vocation - a passion to which you surrender yourself. Pilgrimage has its parallel in ""the interminable ritual of jobseeking"", while the Curriculum Vitae serves as a ""confession of faith"" in meritocracy. Contrition is expected to be shown for gaps in employment. As for purgatory, it's not unlike that ""interim space"" between the worlds of work and unemployment, characterised by a punishing wait or humiliating ritual. Boland, who is senior lecturer in sociology at University College Cork and Griffin, who is lecturer in strategic management at Waterford Institute of Technology, have collated their findings in a new book The Reformation of Welfare: The New Faith of the Labour Market. The product of ""a decade of sustained thought and discussion"", it blends policy analysis and moral philosophy with revealing interviews with jobseekers who attest to the spiritual upheaval caused by unemployment. And it questions whether existing values can survive when the logic of technology and automation take hold. Boland and Griffin wrote the book together so they gave joint answers to the questions as this week's Unthinkable guests. There seems to be a blind spot on both left and right of the political spectrum to what you call ""the Judeo-Christian inheritance"". Why is that? Is part of it a naive belief that religious values no longer inform our thinking? ""Modern thought has its own 'foundation myths'  - the idea that our era is a decisive break with the past, marked by Enlightenment, revolutions or experimental science. Yet, up to a century ago, most politicians and policy makers knew their religion intimately, even if they doubted miracles or heaven. ""More importantly, theological models shaped how they thought about the society, developed the state and judged individual lives... ""Left, right and centre in politics there are elements of the 'Judeo-Christian inheritance'. Socialist ideas reflect the Sermon on the Mount where 'the meek will inherit the earth'. Egalitarianism is preceded by St Paul's 'There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female' in Christianity. Liberalism emphasises freedom and choice, by which individuals are judged, either by the market or by God - the famous 'invisible hand'.  ""Interestingly, both left and right are committed to hard work as redemptive: From Marx to Roosevelt, Stalin to Hitler, DeValera to Thatcher, politicians have endorsed Thessalonians 3.10: 'If anyone should not work, neither should they eat'.  One of the most vivid sections of the book is on purgatory. Can you explain how exactly workers find themselves in this condition? "" Unemployment is not just financially difficult: Free time becomes a burden of anxiously waiting for a welfare claim to be processed, waiting for a job, and just waiting. Time becomes excruciatingly tedious, yet also frantic, because the welfare state demands ritualistic ordeals of interviews, confidence training, career advice and proof of extensive job-search . . . ""This experience reprises the medieval invention of purgatory, a second chance for souls not condemned to hell to purify themselves. These religious roots explain why contemporary society takes life itself as a challenge, a journey of self-discovery, especially through hard times. More importantly, the state imposes this model of redemptive suffering on the unemployed - turning social support into the demand to transform yourself into a worke.r"" Unemployment is associated with feelings of guilt and shame. How can this be overcome?   ""The guilt and shame of unemployment are not inevitable, rather they are a policy choice. At times unemployment in Ireland carried little institutional stigma, the absence of work was a problem of our erratic national economy. This might stem from our post-colonial or Catholic heritage, in which the poor were virtuous: 'Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God'. ""The moralising character of the Troika's bailout found its way into the 'Pathways to Work' policy which sought to reform the wayward unemployed. Effectively this replaced traditional tolerance with the neo-Calvinist values that drove the European Central Bank - which judges the unemployed harshly for their situation, without reference to the macro-economy."" You note Ireland has traditionally had a relatively ""passive"" welfare system ""whereby the unemployed were encouraged but not compelled to seek work"". Is our system more humane than that of other countries? ""Absolutely. Although there were admirers of 'active' welfare systems within Irish politics and social policy, until the arrival of the Troika in 2010, Ireland was a world-leader for its compassionate welfare system. Individuals were assured meaningful financial assistance that prevented absolute poverty without interfering in their lives  - a genuinely 'liberal' welfare state.  ""The Department of Social Protection (DSP), although not without its flaws is our greatest achievement as a State. We have an erratic economy, rapidly whirling though feast and famine, and the 7,000 people who work in the DSP and the representative democracy behind it through communal taxation has held us together as a people. ""We estimate almost half of all Irish adults have relied on unemployment benefit at some stage, especially at pivotal moments - like the pandemic and the global financial crisis before it, the DSP provides a safety net. ""Beyond that - unemployment can lead to social unrest; populist political dissent is often driven by economic deprivation. Complex welfare systems were invented and implemented by liberal and conservative politicians to maintain market capitalism, protect private property and thwart revolutionary impulses."" On the impact of the pandemic, you note that tax receipts ""have proven to be surprisingly resilient"" and it appears ""fewer people are actually needed in work"" once basic goods and services are catered for. Can the economy - and society - flourish with higher levels of unemployment? ""Flourishing depends mainly on the distribution of wealth: more equal societies do better. Fifty years ago, a single wage could buy a house and support a family. Unemployment was low, but the 'participation rate' - the proportion of people in paid employment was also far lower than today. ""That was no utopia - given the gender inequality and personal hardship involved - but the proliferation of lower-paid work since then is no panacea. From a utilitarian sense, work and the economy could be done very differently. The pandemic has proved that yet again and the limits of our shared environment make it a necessity.  ""Our argument is that work and welfare have much deeper roots: We are a work-cult, we believe in the need to work, for ourselves and our kids, and we seek to transform anyone who cannot find work - even if it involves being cruel to be kind. So, dislodging those ideas is no superficial task."" The Reformation of Welfare: The New Faith of the Labour Market is published by Bristol University Press"

""On examination one could clearly see this man was tender over his ankle joint, and had no signs of a DVT. He then had to stay in overnight to wait for a radiologist's report on his ankle X-ray to ensure there was no fracture [because medics are not appropriately trained to read joint X-rays].  ""Had this man been seen by a doctor in the emergency department he would likely have been discharged within a number of hours, thus saving the hospital money,"" they said. Responding, UHL's chief clinical director Prof Brian Lenehan said he would accept the assertion that a medical doctor was not qualified to interpret an X-ray.  However, it should have been relatively straightforward for one of the on-call orthopaedic non-consultant doctors to look at the X-ray and decide if the patient could have been sent home. In another case, a man in his 50s was triaged to the AMU with new hand twitching, but this was later found to have been severe hypocalcaemia requiring critical care and cardiac monitoring.  However, Prof Lenehan said the need for cardiac monitoring would have been there had the patient been seen and assessed in the emergency department, or seen and assessed in the medical emergency department or what is referred to as the AMU. Delay ""The bottom line is that the patient was treated appropriately and the diagnosis was made after a comprehensive history, clinical examination, and tests and then the care escalated appropriately,"" he said.

The three options mentioned at that time were your traditional grid pricing mechanism, flat pricing, or live selling through the mart system. It now appears that a fourth option has emerged, with reports indicating that some factory agents are buying stock for slaughter direct from fatteners on a live weight basis. My information is that several finishers in recent times were offered three options by their factory agents, a grid price, a flat price or a per kilo live price. While the mart offers the possibility of both ringside and online competition when selling, those buying cattle for direct slaughter are potentially excluded from quality assurance or breed bonuses if those animals are slaughtered immediately because they will not fulfil residency requirements. Direct live weight factory agent buying from finishers would appear to get around these issues. The emergence of the mart option for finishers this year allied now to the possibility of direct live weight selling to factory agents are two very positive developments. However, their emergence also make it incumbent on farm organisations to bring the factories to the table to discuss these developments with a view, at the very least, of formalising future sales on the basis that when offered a grid carcase price, the seller is now also offered a live price. I am told that live prices for direct slaughter for dairy bred stock currently range from (EURO)4.40-4.45/kg for bullocks and up to (EURO)4.35/kg for heifers. Contacted factory sources deny they are paying on a live weight basis. What they are paying, however, are base prices that range from (EURO)4.45-4.30/kg for bullocks and (EURO)4.35-4.40/kg for heifers. When you add in the 40c/kg quality assurance payment for under-30 month stock that gives you an overall range of (EURO)4.45-4.60/kg. Throw in breed bonuses, such as the 40c/kg for Angus, and you're at (EURO)4.80/kg. Nice work if you can get it. Prices for young bulls continue to see U grades operate around the (EURO)4.35/kg mark and Rs on (EURO)4.45/kg. On the cull cow front we see Rs at (EURO)3.90/kg, Os at (EURO)3.70-3.80/kg and Ps at (EURO)3.50-3.60/kg. Mixed loads of well-fleshed Os and Ps are reported to be moving at (EURO)3.70-3.80/kg. It is interesting to think that today your good R grade cull cow at (EURO)3.90/kg is making more or less what your R grade bullock or heifer was making 14 months ago when you add the 40c/kg QA payment to their then-base price of (EURO)3.60-3.70/kg. As always there are lots of questions. Will supplies hold? How many cattle do the feedlots currently hold? How long will it be before we see big numbers of bullocks and heifers coming off of grass? It was a potential shortage of grass ahead of last week's rain that factories appeared to pin their hopes on of a possible price pull, causing one factory agent to comment dryly: ""This is the only time I remember the lads in the west looking for rain"". Emergence of mart option for finishers is a positive development"

A pre-Budget submission by Early Childhood Ireland calls on the Government to meet a commitment in the national early years strategy, First 5, to at least double investment by 2028. When asked what effect its investment demands would have on fees, a spokesperson for Early Childhood Ireland said EU countries with high levels of public investment have minimum and maximum fees, depending on family income. ""If or when Ireland moves to a fully Scandinavian model, we would expect to see a similar system here,"" she said. The organisation, whose members provide care for over 120,000 children and their families, noted that parents are paying the highest fees in the EU. It also wants a wage subsidy scheme that was tailored for the sector during the pandemic to be kept in place. A spokesperson noted that childcare settings are diverse with some which are ""ECCEonly"", some offering sessional care, some full day-care, and some after-school only. ""Fees vary depending on a number of factors including most significantly the child's age,"" he said. ""It's just not possible to offer a blanket response about the impact of investment on fees. ""A multi-annual plan for investment would allow providers to look at all aspects of their operations and allow a level of security about income from fees; but again, this is dependent on their individual setting and the services they offer parents."" The submission said a childcare system is not a discretionary or optional service. ""To ensure we transition to a resilient future, Early Childhood Ireland calls on the Government to meet the commitment in the national early years strategy, First 5, to at least double investment by 2028,"" it said. In response to questions, the organisation said the Government has committed to at least doubling the (EURO)485m expenditure of 2018 to over (EURO)970m by 2028. ""They must publish a plan of how they how to achieve this and to implement real year-onyear increases,"" it said. It said the promised public investment would bring Ireland closer to the Scandinavian model which provides agreed subsidies, along with unified quality provision and universal accessibility. ""This all means that everyone pays something, but there is both a floor (minimum amount) and a ceiling (maximum) depending on parental income,"" the group said. ""The Government here is developing a future funding model which needs to address all of these dimensions."" Director of policy at Early Childhood Ireland, Frances Byrne, said the sector is still without a plan for adequate funding. ""Families are poorly served and have waited too long,"" she said. ""We are calling on the Government to take real and immediate action to increase public investment in childcare."" Ms Byrne said the Government has committed to reforming and investing in childcare, but funding was not increased despite significant investment in other essential services in Budget 2021. She said Ireland has consistently remained at the bottom of the class when it comes to childcare investment. She said it invests the least amount in early years of any developed country as a percentage of GDP according to the OECD. ""This lack of investment costs us all,"" she said. ""Parents pay the highest childcare fees from take-home pay in the EU."" She claimed providers operate precariously in a highly complex funding model while average pay and conditions of employment remain poor.

""A series of mutually reinforcing crises, including a devastating recession, have left families and children in Lebanon in a dire situation, affecting just about every aspect of their lives,"" the organisation said, as it published a survey on the impact of the Lebanon crisis on children's lives.  ""With no improvement in sight, more children than ever before are going to bed hungry in Lebanon,"" said Yukie Mokuo, Unicef representative in Lebanon. ""Children's health, education and their very futures are affected as prices are skyrocketing and unemployment continues to increase."" She said more and more families were being forced to resort to measures such as sending their children to work in often dangerous and hazardous conditions, marrying off their young daughters or selling their belongings. The Unicef survey found that 30 per cent of children in Lebanon skipped meals or went to bed hungry last month, while 77 per cent of households did not have enough food or enough money to buy food. In Syrian refugee households, that figure reached 99 per cent. One-third of children receive no primary healthcare while 15 per cent no longer go to school.  Unicef said the protracted economic depression was just one of the compounding crises in Lebanon, which was reeling from the impact of the pandemic and the aftermath of the massive August 2020 Beirut port explosions, as well as the persistent political instability.  ""While the 1.5 million Syrian refugees are the most hard-hit, the number of Lebanese people in need of support is growing rapidly,"" it said. Although the Lebanese parliament has approved $556 million (EUR 470 million) in monthly cash payments of $93 to 500,000 poor Lebanese families to compensate for rising costs, the government has yet to raise funds and organise entitlement cards.  Essential food  Since 2019, Lebanon's import- dependent economy has collapsed and the value of its currency has plunged by 90 per cent against the dollar, depriving residents of essential food, medicine and fuel. The UN estimates 55 per cent of Lebanon's population lives in poverty.   The country's divided politicians have failed to form an independent government capable of tackling the interlocked crises and unlocking $21 billion in international aid.  Deadlock has forced outsiders to come to the rescue. The World Bank has financed Lebanon's Covid-19 vaccine roll out, driving down infection and death rates. France has increased pressure on politicians to agree on a cabinet by imposing sanctions on unnamed individuals while working on a financial mechanism to fund projects independent of the politicians.  A Turkish company has resumed supplying Lebanon with electricity from two power barges anchored offshore, although Lebanon owes the firm $100 million.  The International Monetary Fund is expected to provide $900 million to shore up the dangerously depleted reserves of the central bank which, under pressure, has reduced subsidies on fuel, raising prices by 35 per cent and prompting street protests."

The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC) declined the offer from Donegal man Martin Ferris. The 32-year-old computer science student and electrician had been instructed to pay the charity when he appeared before Letterkenny Circuit Court. Ferris had admitted downloading dozens of pictures and videos of children being sexually abused by a German-based paedophile ring. He was caught by gardaí who raided two properties after the accused was identified by his IP computer address by European police agency Interpol. Officers raided his house in Ballyshannon and a rented flat in Letterkenny, where they found the cache of material. The haul included 152 images and 143 videos, all containing explicit material of children aged from four to 14. Ferris immediately admitted his crimes to gardaí, saying he would ""save them the hassle"" of looking for child abuse images on his laptops. Since being caught, Ferris has undergone counselling. He had brought (EURO)2,500 to court, which he wanted to offer as some compensation to a children's charity for what he had done. He added: ""I have seen my behaviour and I have seen that this is not a victimless crime and there had to be accountability and I can give something back."" He had not come to the attention of gardaí since he was caught with the material. His family had supported him throughout the case, although he admitted that a small number of people had shunned him. His barrister, Peter Nolan, said that while the crimes were appalling, he suggested it was on the lower end of the scale with regard to the volume seen in other cases before the courts. Judge John Aylmer said the first charge of images contained on the hard drive was of a very serious nature despite what he called the ""relatively low volume"" of material found. He placed this charge at the upper end of such categories and merited a prison sentence of two-and-a-half years before mitigation. The state prosecutor said they had identified a regeneration project in Ballyshannon to which the donation could be forwarded."

A simple celebratory moment for when the kids are down and Sofie and I can catch up uninterrupted. We tend to eat dinner early with the boys so find ourselves looking for something around 7pm. A little plate of arancini is a true treat. Golden breadcrumbed balls of risotto rice with cheese are perfect to make if you whip up a summer risotto and have some leftovers in the pan. Oozing with stringy mozzarella, they transport you to a little Italian eatery, even if you don't quite get there in person this summer. Around this time of year, I find myself on autopilot when it comes to cooking in the kitchen and the classics are what I rely on for simple seasonal suppers. Often the test of a good cook, the humble Caesar salad, done well, remains one of my favourite things to make in the summer months. If I'm going to put in the effort, the dressing must be the classic version and include anchovies for their salty bite; from there it is open to interpretation. Purists may baulk at the idea of soft-boiled eggs and charred chicken but for me they make it a generous summer meal and are essential. I'm also not a fan of chunky croutons and, in the recipe here, I toast crumbs of sourdough to sprinkle all the way through the salad so every bite gets the all-important crunch. For a sweet summer pick-me-up, my no-bake raspberry and white chocolate cheesecake bars involve minimal fuss and are a riff off a recipe I've been making for years due to the oohs and aahs they almost always garner. Keeping things simple for the summer will have you in good stride to enjoy the best of the long evenings. Classic Chicken Caesar Salad Cook time: 20 minutes Serves: 4 Ingredients 2 large skin-on chicken breasts 1 tsp flaky sea salt 1 sprig of rosemary, leaves stripped A pinch of smoked paprika 3 tbsp olive oil Finely grated zest of 1 lemon 2 thick slices of sourdough 2 free-range eggs 2 romaine lettuces, roughly torn Parmesan shavings, to serve Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper For the dressing 1 fat clove of garlic 2-3 anchovies 1 tsp Dijon mustard A dash of Worcestershire sauce 1 free-range egg yolk 150ml extra-virgin olive oil A splash of boiling water 1 tbsp finely grated Parmesan cheese A good squeeze of lemon juice Method 1. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/400F/ Gas Mark 6. 2. Remove the skin from the chicken breasts and place the skin on a baking sheet. Season and then place another baking sheet on top and roast for 15-20 minutes until golden and crisp. Set aside to cool, then break into pieces. 3. Flatten the chicken breasts between two pieces of parchment paper with a rolling pin until 1cm thick. Place in a dish. With a pestle and mortar, grind the sea salt and rosemary together to form a green salt. 4. Sprinkle a little over the chicken (save the rest for another dish). Add the paprika, a good grinding of black pepper, 1 tbsp of the oil and the finely grated lemon zest. Marinate for 20 minutes if you have time. 5. Toss the sourdough bread in the remaining oil and spread on to a baking sheet, then bake for 10 minutes until golden and crisp. Set aside. 6. Make the dressing. In a small food processor, whiz the garlic, anchovies, mus- tard, Worcestershire sauce and egg yolk together. Season, then gradually whiz in the oil to form a smooth, luscious sauce. Add a splash of just-boiled water and the Parmesan and a good squeeze of lemon juice to taste. 7. Put the eggs in a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and cook for 5 minutes, then drain and cool under running water. Once cool, peel and quarter 8. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes each side until golden and charred. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes, then slice. 9. Put the romaine lettuce in a bowl and toss this with the chicken, croutons, hardboiled eggs and some extra Parmesan shavings. Finally, drizzle with the dressing, scatter with the chicken crackling/ skin and serve. Raspberry & White Chocolate Cheesecake Bars Cook time: 30 mins + chilling time Serves: 10 Ingredients 200g plain digestive biscuits 100g unsalted butter 400g good-quality white chocolate, broken into pieces 250g full-fat cream cheese 200ml double cream 250g mascarpone cheese 250g raspberries, half mashed to a purée and half whole Method 1. Bash the biscuits in a resealable bag with a rolling pin until you have fine crumbs. 2. Melt the butter in a large saucepan, then add the biscuit crumbs and mix to combine. Tip the butter-and-biscuit mix into the base of a 20cm square loose-bottomed cake tin. Chill while you make the filling. 3. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, in a single layer if you can, over a pan of barely simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl does not touch the water, and gently melt, without stirring. You can tell that it is melted when you gently nudge a square and it will dissolve. Only then, stir together and set aside. 4. Beat the cream cheese, cream and mascarpone in a large bowl with an electric hand whisk, then, with a spatula, stir through the white chocolate and fold in the whole raspberries, but leave some to scatter at the end. Then fold in the puréed raspberries just once or twice so as not to over-mix. 5. Spread the mixture evenly over the top of the biscuit base (the ripple will become more pronounced as you spread). Scatter with the leftover raspberries and just push them into the mix. Cover and put in fridge to chill and set for at least 3 hours. 6. Remove the cheesecake from the tin and cut into bars, then serve. Mozzarella Arancini Time: 35 minutes Makes: 20 balls For the arancini 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, finely diced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 200g arborio or risotto rice 250ml white wine 750ml vegetable stock 75g pecorino, finely grated ½ x 150g ball mozzarella, cut into 20 pieces 50g flour 2 large eggs, beaten 150g panko breadcrumbs To serve 250ml passata 3 tbsp hot sauce ½ tsp garlic powder A small handful of basil leaves Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper Method 1. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and sauté for 6-8 minutes until softened without colour. Add the arborio rice and toss to coat. Pour in the white wine and let it bubble away for a couple of minutes until reduced, stirring regularly. 2. Add the hot stock, little by little, until it is all used up and the rice has cooked; this will take about 20 minutes. Make sure each amount you add is soaked up before adding the next. 3. Stir through the pecorino, season to taste, then spread the risotto in an even layer on a tray lined with parchment paper. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 2 hours. 4. To form the arancini, scoop a portion of the cooled risotto into your hand. Form a patty with 2in in diameter approximately and place a piece of mozzarella into the centre. Repeat to give you 20 in total. Place on a tray in the freezer for at least an hour until solidified to ensure they hold their shape. 5. Once ready to cook, heat a large saucepan a third full with oil or deep enough to cover the arancini and allow to reach a temperature of 180C. When it has almost come up to temperature, add the flour, egg and panko to three separate bowls. Toss the arancini in the flour, followed by the egg and then the breadcrumbs, placing on a tray as each piece gets coated. Deep-fry in batches of five for 5-6 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Transfer to a double layer of kitchen paper to drain. Combine the passata, hot sauce and garlic powder in a small saucepan and 6. bring to a simmer for 2-3 minutes, then remove from the heat. Serve the arancini on a platter alongside the sauce and a scattering of basil leaves. Graphic   SKEHAN DONAL PICTURES:"

In one camp, there's the earnest believers who think that consumers love their brands so much that they want to engage with them on a regular basis and talk about them to their friends, family and colleagues in both the virtual and real worlds. If the brand has a sense of purpose, or even invents one, even better. Not surprisingly this camp is headed up by the likes of Marc Pritchard of P&G and the former CMO of Unilever Keith Weed, who now sits on the board of WPP. In the other camp, however, there's an equally earnest cohort that believes brands tend to overestimate what consumers actually think about them. For some of the better-known advocates like Professor Byron Sharp, Mark Ritson and the so-called 'Ad Contrarian', Bob Hoffman, consumers don't give a horlicks about brands and the vast majority of them are not remotely interested in engaging with them online or offline unless there's something in it for them. In many cases marketers are spending way too much time and money on cosying up to consumers. But what about consumers themselves? What do they think about brands and the role they play in their day-to-day lives? A new global report by the French agency giant Havas shines a light on how people view brands, what they expect from them and what marketers should be doing to prioritise the value-exchange between brand and consumer. Called Meaningful Brands 2021, Havas has also published a number of country-specific reports which, in the case of Ireland, was carried out by Havas Dublin and will be published next week. Irish marketers who are in any way squeamish should look away now. According to Havas, 77pc of Irish people wouldn't care if brands disappeared overnight. This compares with a global average of 75pc. In addition, the survey notes that 74pc of Irish people are tired of the empty promises that brands make while only 41pc of us view brands as trustworthy. When it comes to purpose-led brands, our cynicism is still palpable with only 30pc feeling satisfied with a brand's actions to make the world a better place, while just 20pc think brands are being transparent about their commitments and promises. But all is not lost and brands will not disappear overnight. But if they want to remain relevant and play a role in people's lives then they need to take action, according to the Havas research which highlights the role they can play in wider societal and environmental issues, particularly in a post-pandemic world. ""Like so many other trends and behaviours, the pandemic has played a role in accelerating things. The importance of positive environmental and societal change has come to the fore. As have peoples' demands for businesses and brands to play a part in solving them,"" says Chris Upton, CEO of Havas Dublin. ""I am reminded of a paper written by Ronen Shamir in 2008 titled The Age of Responsibilisation. He set out the idea of market embedded morality. In it he spoke about how governments have shifted their focus from societal and moral issues to economic ones, and in so doing had passed the burden of these societal and moral issues on to the public, who in turn have been passing this burden on to businesses and corporations. I believe we may have entered the age of cynicism as a result of this shift. And what we are seeing is the lag between consumers setting a higher bar, and the time it takes for businesses and brands to act in an authentic and meaningful way,"" he says. According to the Havas survey, some 77pc of Irish adults believe brands must act now for the good of society and the planet, while 83pc expect brands to show support to people in times of crisis. What's the trade-off? According to Havas, 55pc of consumers are ready to pay more for a brand that takes a stand on these issues, while 68pc of us prefer to buy from companies with a reputation for having a purpose other than just maximising shareholder value and profits. Brands take note."

After losing four times in finals, early exits in major tournaments and even a decision to retire from the national team, the superstar celebrated a much-awaited title with Argentina at Saturday's 1-0 win against Brazil in the Maracana Stadium. The title ended Argentina's 28-year drought of major trophies, with Messi as the best player with four goals and five assists. The captain also broke the team's record for international appearances with 151 matches. ""I needed to remove from myself the thorn of achieving something with the national team,"" Messi said. When Uruguayan referee Esteban Ostojich blew the final whistle, Messi knelt down on the pitch and covered his face with his hands. After he lifted the Copa America trophy, Messi spoke to his family on the phone. He flicked the golden medal around his neck and shouted ""I won, I won!"" The next challenge is to win the World Cup in Qatar next year, which would be the first since Maradona took the team to the title in 1986. Until Saturday, Messi's titles with Argentina were only the U-20 World Cup title in 2005 and a gold medal at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. His first frustration at the senior-team level started at age 19 in the World Cup quarter-finals elimination against Germany in 2006. One year later, he saw Brazil beat Argentina 3-0 in the Copa America final. His next major shot at winning with Argentina came in the 2014 World Cup final against Germany, which they lost 1-0 at the Maracana Stadium. Chile would crush Messi's hopes in two Copa America finals, in 2015 and 2016, both on penalties. After the second defeat to Chile, Messi told journalists that the national team was over for him. ""It is not for me. I tried, I think that is it,"" he said. But he returned for South American World Cup qualifiers in which Argentina struggled. He took the team to Russia, but the round-of-16 defeat against France came at a turbulent time for the team. Messi became more aggressive in the 2019 Copa America, much to the pleasure of Argentinian fans who considered him to be too cold, too European. Under a coach with little experience, Lionel Scaloni, he was surrounded by young players who got the best of him. On Saturday, Messi kissed the Copa America trophy and lifted it at age 34. The biggest gap in his decorated career is now closed. His first public words after the title showed how thrilled and relieved he felt. ""What a beautiful madness!,"" Messi said in an Instagram post showing him shirtless holding the Copa America trophy in the Maracana's dressing room. ""This is unbelievable! Thank you, God! We are the champions!"" Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, one of Argentina's key players in the tournament, said Messi ""is the one who most deserved"" to win the South American title. Messi later said his happiness was ""unexplainable."" ""I was sad before, but I knew that at some point it was going to happen,"" he said. ""I feel that God was saving this moment for me, against Brazil in a final and in their country."""

The Dubs overcame a slow start to run the Rebels close at the end, coming within four points as the game moved into injury time. Unfortunately for the Leinster champions, who conceded 1-4 without reply in the opening eight minutes, they could not come to within a single score of Cork, who held on to win. Back in 2017, the two sides had met in the final of a special oneoff All-Ireland U17 competition held to compensate the players who missed out on minor level with the change from U18 to U17. Two points separated the teams on that occasion and, while it looked for periods last year as if this championship might go uncontested, the outcome here was the same, but not without twists and turns. Cork hadn't played since beating Tipperary in the Munster final on December 23 while Dublin had a tune-up with their provincial decider against Galway a week and a half ago. However, there were no signs of rustiness from the Rebels as they slotted over three points inside 90 seconds as Pádraig Power, Alan Connolly and Shane Barrett all scored, and they moved seven ahead when Seán Twomey goaled in the eighth minute. The same lead was still in place by the water-break, though Liam Murphy had got Dublin up and running and they could have reduced Cork's lead further but for some loose shooting. By the same token, Cork might have had a second goal on 22 minutes as Eddie Gibbons saved Darragh Flynn's shot and Dublin were still seven behind at half-time, 1-11 to 0-7, following a Kevin Desmond point. They had renewed momentum on the restart, a pair of fine Micheál Murphy points in the space of a minute bringing them to within five, 1-12 to 1-10, by the 36th minute. While Cork lacked the fluency of the early stages, they continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over. An excellent individual point from Barrett made it 1-15 to 0-12 in the 42nd minute before Dublin replied with Dara Purcell and Darragh Power, just before and after the second water-break. That four-point gap was as close as the Dubs had come but Cork looked to have quelled any comeback talk as Alan Connolly's free was followed by Power's goal, created by Brian Roche. When sub Brian Hayes tacked on two points in Cork's favour in quick succession, it was 2-18 to 0-14 and they appeared to be home and hosed. But Dublin came back again. Murphy's fifth, a long-range free from goalkeeper Gibbons and Purcell's fourth made it 2-18 to 0-17 and they had that elusive goal when Gibbons' 20m free was saved and their sub Luke McDwyer netting the rebound. It was a testing period for Cork as injury time approached. But Jack Cahalane's point settled Cork this time and though Murphy had his sixth point in response, Dublin couldn't come any closer.

I don't think so"", Opinion, Weekend Review, July 10th) that Ireland's low corporation tax rate played a key role in stimulating the surge of inward investment which underpinned Ireland's high economic growth rate over the last 30 years. There was no change in the rate of tax payable by foreign firms operating in Ireland between 1980 (when a 10 per cent rate was introduced) and 2003 (when the rate was raised to 12.5 per cent). The surge in inward investment commenced in the early 1990s, about half-way between those dates.It is difficult, therefore, to see what role the tax rate (which remained unchanged) had in setting off this surge. What did change was the quality of employment created by foreign firms during the so-called ""Celtic Tiger"" period, which was far superior to the low-skill assembly and packaging jobs which were a dominant feature of earlier inward investment. It is much more likely, therefore, that the increasing availability of skilled workers was the key driver of the rapid growth of inward investment in Ireland in recent decades.The increase in the tax rate in 2003 had no discernible impact on this growth. - Is mise, PROINNSIAS BREATHNACH, Maynooth, Co Kildare."

""What is she doing at a beach then?"" For more than 40 years I've had a crippling phobia, so awkward interactions of this nature are a regular occurrence. My family and friends try their best to protect me but usually a severe panic attack ensues, bringing with it a racing heart, sweaty palms, flowing tears and the inevitable evaporation of any logic. Ireland is a country of dog lovers. Avoiding locations where I might meet a stray dog off a lead takes planning. I love the outdoors and I'd like nothing more than to hike up the Comeragh mountains, stroll around Waterford city's picturesque nature park or go for a run along Woodstown strand. These are all places I've avoided because to me, they're ""dog-owner territory"". I've coined a word ""dogdar"" to describe my phobia. It means I can see/hear/sense a dog a mile off while strangers around me remain oblivious to my hyper alertness. It wasn't until my daughter was born in 2010 that I realised I needed to get help for something that had been impacting my life for as long as I could remember. A co-worker suggested I attend a hypnotherapist who was known for having successfully treated phobias. I took the leap of faith, set up an appointment and stuck with it for many sessions. I know hypnotherapy has worked for others, but it just wasn't for me. I continued with my life and tried to ignore the fact that panic attacks were increasingly impacting on my day to day, especially now with two small children. In more recent years, I have come away from beach trips, more stressed than when I arrived, because of so many dogs off leashes. Waterford city bylaws are saved on my phone, so I can quickly show them to aggressive dog owners who refuse to put their pet on a lead. Mostly, they reluctantly agree when they see proof that it's the law, but some dog owners have refused point blank. On those occasions, I have gone home feeling drained and defeated. Of course, I've met many respectful dog owners too but the former understandably has left a more lasting negative effect.  Catalyst for change While I know I should be seeking out help for my own benefit, the truth is my children have been the main catalyst. My 10-year-old daughter's fear levels are creeping as high as mine, having learned the behaviour from me. An incident in Dunmore East last year was another turning point for me to seek help. We were on Councillor's Strand, enjoying a sunny summer evening when my ""dogdar"" suddenly went into overdrive. I could hear a dog barking excitedly, far away at the top of the hill, but the sound started to get closer, quickly. When I saw the dog bounding down the hill at speed, I screamed for help. The animal was steps away from my son and me before the owners managed to get him back on a lead. To be fair to them, they were extremely apologetic, but I knew my reaction to the experience had already registered strongly with my six year old. Up to that day, I had shielded him from being directly impacted by my phobia and so he had enjoyed interacting with dogs. Unsurprisingly, there was a noticeable change in my son's behaviour after he had been in the arms of his mum while she was coping with a major panic attack. I have no doubt he felt every muscle of mine squeeze tighter around him, along with my hysterical screams for help, bellowing in his ear. A phobia is ""an irrational fear of something that's unlikely to cause harm"". The key word is ""irrational"". It doesn't matter how many times you say to someone who's having a panic attack: ""Ah, he/she won't touch you"", your rational thinking is falling on deaf ears to someone like me who has a vivid imagination to add to the phobia. In those split seconds, I've already decided your cute fur baby is out to get me. Emotional needs Enter Human Givens therapy. Founded in 1992, this approach integrates elements of  cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) to provide a holistic treatment. In a promotional video, co-founder Joe Griffin says ""if you are getting your emotional needs met, your mental health will thrive"". He goes on to identify three barriers which may hinder those needs being met: 1. Toxic environment - eg a child raised in abusive circumstances. 2. Innate guidance systems that are 50 per cent genetic/50 per cent learned but not being properly nourished. (Griffin believes the culture to which we are born into must provide us with the proper coping skills to ensure our emotional needs are being sufficiently met throughout our life.) 3. Damage because of a physical or emotional trauma. Last year, I began a course of Human Givens-based therapy which is helping me to finally tackle my dog phobia. Naively, I thought it would take just a few sessions. What transpired was 10 months of regular, intense sessions combined with targeted ""homework"" in between. I have gradually realised that my anxiety disorder is not about dogs. My phobia stems from a few risk factors but most significantly, a childhood trauma. I don't know when the sexual abuse began, but my earliest memory is six years old, and my last memory is when I was 10. Someone who knew better took control of me and my body and I didn't understand at the time that it was wrong. Those years are vitally formative for a child's development. For me, it was the start of a crippling anxiety disorder that stunted my emotional growth. When I realised at 17 years old that I was a survivor of abuse, I sought out help and received support from various councillors, both here in Ireland and while I studied in America. The important lesson I learned is that I had to keep trying until I found support that works for me. My psychotherapist has spent the last 10 months sensitively and expertly navigating me through various barriers. I've come to understand that my phobia is really about my perception of not being in control. In that moment, I believe my personal space is going to be brutally invaded without my permission. I don't want to live with that excruciating fear anymore.  Golden retriever Recently, I felt strong enough to put my hard work to the test. A dog-loving and empathetic friend volunteered to introduce my children and me to her gorgeous and, more crucially, calm,  10-year-old golden retriever called Cannon. The three of us were tentative at first but I quickly drew on my newly acquired skills. Thirty minutes later, I was throwing a ball for the dog to catch. My six year old, seeing my confidence, quickly followed suit and my 10-year-old daughter who has been the most impacted by my phobia, reached out to rub the dog too.  I can't adequately describe the joy I felt at watching my boy play so lovingly with this beautiful animal that just wanted to play too. With my newfound confidence, I asked another friend, later that week, if I could meet with her husky Marley. It was possibly a step too far too soon. I was visibly shaking while I rubbed him even though he was on a lead the whole time. While I acknowledge it was an exhausting experience, I'm also proud that I didn't run. Afterwards I felt drained but exhilarated too.  I know these two episodes are just part of an ongoing journey but a massive milestone nonetheless so I'm taking the time now, to stop and savour the moment. I posted a video online, of me playing with Cannon. Family and friends were initially shocked but immediately supportive. They know this is a game-changer not only for me, but for my husband and our two children too.  They've all witnessed my panic attacks and I know they've felt frustration at not being able to help. It's liberating to understand I can now go wherever I want; an ironic feeling to have during a global pandemic.  If you're reading this as someone dealing with anxiety and would like to get help but you're wondering ""how can I gauge what is the right approach for me?"", I'll leave the final word to Griffin: ""A long-term answer to mental illness is a life that works."""

Last month, Taoiseach Micheál Martin was reminded of that enduring relationship when he met the island's chief minister Howard Quayle while attending a meeting of the British-Irish Council in Co Fermanagh. A personal intervention by Éamon de Valera in 1947 resulted in a ""huge turning point in the survival and revival"" of the Manx language. In 1871, around 25pc of Manx people said they could speak Manx. By 1901, that figure was roughly 9pc. In 1921, it had fallen further, to around 1pc. In 1938, de Valera was approached by two people from the Isle of Man about providing financial assistance to ""further Celtic culture"". And so, on July 23, 1947, he made a oneday state visit to the island as part of a cruise tour of the Irish Sea aboard a former royal navy fisheries protection vessel. Accompanied by his son, Rúaidhrí, and officers, de Valera met Lieutenant Governor Sir Geoffrey Bromet and Lady Bromet, as well as Captain JM Cain ADC, the mayor of Douglas. A tour of the island by car took in Douglas Town Hall, Government House, the Manx Museum and Harry Kelly's Cottage at Cregneash where he met Ned Maddrell, a native speaker. During the encounter, de Valera was able to speak Irish while Maddrell spoke Manx, and they could understand one another. There he learned about the vulnerable state of the Manx language and offered to send the Irish Folklore Commission's audio recording equipment to the island to capture and preserve spoken Manx. By then there were only around 20 native speakers left. On April 21, 1948, Irish folk collector Kevin Danaher took a recording van to Douglas on a cattle boat and recorded as much spoken Manx as he could. Those recordings can now be listened to at the Manx Museum, held by Manx National Heritage. ""Because of de Valera's recordings, we now have a couple of thousand people speaking Manx on the island,"" Mr Quayle told the Sunday Independent. ""At one of the schools, everything is done in Manx, including maths. Manx has had a massive revival, and that's down to de Valera."" He says the island will ""never forget"" de Valera's intervention, and presented a photo of the historic visit to Mr Martin. ""Our culture is very important to us. We nearly lost our language, and an outsider spotted that situation. If he hadn't sent over the recording equipment, it could have been lost for ever."" De Valera's grandson, the Fianna Fáil TD Éamon Ó Cuív, feels ""very proud"" of the endeavour and says it ""shows the advantages of taking prompt action when an opportunity comes"". ""One of the big thrills for me was visiting the Isle of Man and visiting the Manx Gaelic school,"" he said. ""There are children now being taught true Manx in a primary school in the Isle of Man because of my grandfather. ""They wouldn't be teaching it if they didn't know how to pronounce it and they only know that because of the recordings. ""It gives you a great pleasure to think that connection has been retained.

Although the government has deployed 2,500 troops to help overstretched police quell violent protests and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, South Africans were bracing themselves for a fifth night of unrest last night.  So far 26 people have been killed since last Friday in KwaZulu-Natal, when protests calling for Zuma's release from jail erupted in the former president's home province. Most of the victims died in stampedes that occurred during mass-looting incidents, according to provincial premier Sihle Zikalala. Gauteng premier David Makuru has said the number of deaths from the violence that has swept through his province stood at 19 as of yesterday. More than 750 people linked to the unrest in both provinces have been arrested to date, say police.  Troop deployment After touring affected areas around Durban, KwaZulu-Natal's capital,  yesterday the country's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), said the current troop deployment is insufficient. ""It is no exaggeration to say the affected neighbourhoods have been turned into a war zone by marauding mobs and there is still no sign of the violence letting up,"" DA leader John Steenhuisen told reporters. The destruction of property and looting are causing significant damage to local businesses, which are already buckling under the strain of South Africa's low economic growth and a crippling third wave of coronavirus. The violence is also hindering the government's stuttering Covid-19 vaccination drive, with 109 inoculation sites now closed nationwide.  State security minister Ayanda Dlodlo said yesterday her officials are investigating whether former security agents linked to Zuma (79) were instigating the violence.  The former president was removed from office in 2018 by the ruling African National Congress party over allegations of corruption. He received a 15-month jail sentence from the constitutional court in late June for refusing to obey its order to attend an inquiry. On Monday, lawyers for South Africa's fourth democratically elected president applied to the constitutional court to have his jail sentence rescinded, and it is expected to deliver its ruling in the coming days.  While calls to free Zuma from prison were the initial spark for the unrest, South Africa's Institute for Security Studies has said growing inequality, poverty and joblessness have prompted thousands of desperate and angry citizens to join in.

As the sun set on a unique Wimbledon last night the game was left in the extraordinary position of having three immortals duking it out with 60 major titles split between them. Novak Djokovic joined the other two on 20 when he claimed his sixth Wimbledon title against the spirited Matteo Berrettini, but the 25-year-old Roman could not prevent a 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 defeat whic took three hours and 24 minutes. He will be back, but so will Djokovic, who became the first man since Rod Laver to win the first three majors of the season. The calendar Slam is on at the US Open and only the most foolhardy would bet against the Serb. It should not be forgotten that this year there was only a two-week gap between the clay of Roland Garros and the grass - at its most perilous in the early rounds - of SW19. So this was the trickiest hurdle to surmount and it would explain why, including yesterday, Djokovic was never really at his best in the past fortnight. Consider also that the 34-year-old only had one Grand Slam to his name when Federer had 16. In reality, while Nadal has largely monopolised Paris, when it comes to the other surfaces and big tournaments one player has really dominated the last six years. The great Swiss looks to have run out of road, while Nadal was so broken by his defeat at Roland Garros he did not make the trip across the Channel this time. Their parity with Djokovic is looking both temporary and defenceless. We saw again in this final, as we did in the semis against Denis Shapovalov, that the Serb lives rent-free in the heads of opponents when it comes to so many crunch points. That advantage has been hard-earned over a long period. His ability to lock in and force other players to take the initiative under the greatest pressure is arguably his biggest single attribute. History weighed heavily upon him here and this was not one of his great performances. He was fragile at times, his second serve sitting up to be punished, but it was enough, as it so often is. In the two big duels of the match his returns just edged the Berrettini powerhouse serve, while his backhand shaded his opponent's similarly clubbed forehand. He knows better than to panic and when he went behind he played within himself, working out that the conservative way would probably be sufficient. He made 21 unforced errors to Berrettini's 48. The Italian will only improve for this experience and has announced himself as a major force. The volcanic eruption of the arena which greeted Berrettini taking the first set was a beautiful sound, no matter what your view, or who you support. It had been an eventful opener and one which both players, clearly nervous, had looked reluctant to win. Djokovic was extremely edgy at the start. Luckily for him the Italian was even more uptight and, as we have seen so often before, could not take his chances. Somehow the Serb found himself 4-1 up and when he moved to 5-2 all looked predictable. There then followed a 22-point game which Berrettini held after saving a set point. That tipped Djokovic back into the anxiety zone and he was broken when the Italian reached a dropshot and flicked a winner down the line. Berrettini knew he had to apply some scoreboard pressure to have any chance and he delivered in the tiebreak. As for most of this event Djokovic had not been at his imperious best, but he broke early and after getting ahead to 5-2 managed to serve it out, confidently, at the second time of asking. The Italian was duly broken early in the third as an increasingly assured Djokovic cleverly stole into the net. Doing his best to keep the ball away from his opponent's fearsome forehand he had a mini-crisis in the sixth game of the third but saved two break points, interacting with an increasingly boisterous crowd. He was also slowing down the pace he was giving to Berrettini's groundstrokes and drawing errors as a result. A forehand wide sealed a two sets to one lead. Just about keeping his head amid a highly charged atmosphere, at 3-3 in the fourth set the pressure paid off when Berrettini double faulted on break point to seal the outcome. The stately Centre Court has been a symbol of continuity in disturbing times. So, increasingly, is the sight of Djokovic winning.

But the words of former economy minister Paul Frew as he took the brief reins at the Department for the Economy have been swallowed up by political upheaval. And the continued backlash against the Northern Ireland Protocol at political level hasn’t helped either. The Protocol, drawn up to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, is not without its problems. But the opportunities afforded by it would be very difficult to match in any other trading arrangement. Businesses in Northern Ireland can export goods freely to both Great Britain and the EU without paperwork or duties – the same unfettered access available prior to the UK’s exit from the EU. This point, it seems, is largely absent from the ongoing political debate. Much of the focus since the start of the year has been on difficulties importing goods into the region from Great Britain. This rhetoric combined with failure to accept Northern Ireland’s new trading position, an arrangement consented to by both the British government and the EU, has meant Northern Ireland’s uniquely privileged trading zone has been largely forgotten. Without a doubt, businesses have and continue to experience delays in shipments and difficulties with paperwork. For many, their response has been to adapt and transform. Larger retailers experiencing delays in shipments of food and other goods from Great Britain, have looked to smaller domestic suppliers to fill shelves. Imports from the Republic increased by more than 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period last year. And it’s not all one-way traffic. Highlighting the problems importers in Ireland have experienced in getting goods in from Great Britain, cross-border trade is also on the increase with exports from Northern Ireland to the Republic up by over 60 per cent in the same period. Northern Ireland has an opportunity. To position itself as open for business, and to take advantage of its unique trading position. To establish itself as a key location for foreign direct investment to add to the 1,100 international companies already employing 100,000 workers in the region. Inquiries about inward investment into the region are increasing, distributors and manufacturers of high tariff goods are recognising the opportunities the region offers. Domestically, local goods are being substituted for goods that are having difficulties entering the region. City & Growth deals, initiatives to harness investment and create jobs, will pump £1 billion into the region over the coming decade. Holistically this could translate into sustained economic growth for Northern Ireland. While the UK and EU continue to work to reach some form of agreement on the practicalities needed to make the Protocol work, business is already coming up with its own solution; it does not and cannot stop. So far there has been a level of flexibility and more time given to adjust to the new environment – this isn’t always a good thing. Businesses need certainty to plan their operations and supply chains whatever the final form the Protocol might take. In their own way, many are already accepting what the Protocol means for their individual circumstances with some already grasping the opportunities which are on the table. The Protocol is the result of Brexit. Former Prime Minister Theresa May once said: “Brexit means Brexit”. Failing to see the bigger picture of the Protocol, and its opportunities, could cost Northern Ireland dearly in the long run.

If you can park all those early historians' rows, and pitch your own fork forward a little, you'll find Ireland is now trying to turn back another inexorable tide with little more than a cocktail sausage stick this time. Ireland has for 50-plus years traded upon the conviction that the EU has no right to fix taxes of any kind because that's a matter for national governments. For decades Dublin has dug in on the principle that any such taxation changes required member government unanimity to become reality. And to change that unanimity tax rule you required - yes, you guessed it - unanimity. Sound as houses, you'd have said. But the winds of change are blowing strongly on this issue and Ireland may yet cut a pretty sad and powerless figure standing out there alone among EU and world states as big change is teed up. Or, worse again, this country may be with some allies that have even less political oomph than Dublin, trying to turn back what is beginning to look like a global taxation tide of change. Hence that symbol of Brussels' five-to-seven evening social and political interaction: the cocktail sausage stick. Try an outing in Brussels, overindulge, and you find several of the threatening little wooden things in your pockets. In recent weeks a global consensus has emerged among 130 countries on tax reform on how to deal with multinational firms that have played one tax jurisdiction against another to pay a minuscule share of what might be fair. Ireland has hung back citing two problems - one is the minimum 15pc rate which is up from Ireland's 12.5pc in operation since the late 1990s. Ireland has already accepted the second issue about how subsidiary companies must be taxed in countries where sales of multinational product output is at its highest. It is hard to argue against taxation in countries where these companies generate their highest revenues. The principle of pursuing the multinationals - who pay little to anyone anywhere - is on the cards for a long time. It has been pursued by the western economies umbrella body, the OECD, and broad principles of the same idea have this past weekend been endorsed by the G20 economies at a summit in Venice. Ireland is among eight states to hold out and we're not in the most politically powerful company. Admittedly, there are gaps in the agreed details between the EU and the US approach. But the key issue is what stance the US will eventually take. US President Joe Biden may very well not be able to get this package through the US House of Representatives and the Senate where there are a host of cross-cutting regional interests and uncertain parliamentary arithmetic. Such deadlock might grant Ireland a temporary reprieve and we must always remember that there are Irish jobs at stake here. But if the US does formally sign up - then Ireland must make a virtue of necessity. Then we must fall back on the hope that high-end skilled jobs are still possible to be landed in this country. The potential changes do not, however, stop there. Tomorrow the policy-guiding Commission will publish plans to increase taxes on polluting fuels, most notably aviation fuel. Here we go back to the most basic principle of co-ordination, whereby Brussels pledged to cut carbon emissions by 55pc by 2030, achieving zero-carbon by 2050. How do you do that with duty-free kerosene, or paraffin, to an older generation powering planes? Let's recall that Ireland is signed up to these EU carbon reduction targets. Things are going to get much tougher here soon. Graphic   Key issue is what stance Joe Biden's US will take"

""For us, it's a top priority, and this is also the reason why we decided to put on hold our proposal on the digital levy.

While Ireland is ""fully"" behind the new taxing rights, a move the Government estimates could cost it up to (EURO)2bn a year by 2025, it has a ""reservation"" about the 15pc mini mum rate. The deal was endorsed by finance ministers from the world's top 20 economies (G20) on Saturday in what the European Commission called an ""historic"" agreement. The OECD is now working out a formula for reallocating multinational profits by country and a base for the 15pc rate, which it intends to publish before a G20 leaders' summit at the end of October.

Kerry advanced to the McDonagh final on the goal difference where they will face Westmeath on Saturday while Sheehan turns his attentions to tonight’s All-Ireland U20B quarter-final joust with Armagh in the Athletic Grounds (7.15pm). After losing to Antrim in Ballycran at the start of the month, Down’s U20s drop down to the All-Ireland ‘B’ series. “I’d be a big advocate of the tiered competition at U20 level along the lines of the Joe McDonagh,” said Sheehan. “Probably hurling people are more realistic as to their place in the world than football people. I accept everyone wants to play in the ‘A’ competition but I’d rather play in a competition where my players are competitive and learning rather than being beaten by 40 points and being embarrassed at the end of it. “Hopefully we can get over Armagh and the young lads can look forward to an All-Ireland semi-final.” Donegal and Derry’s U20 hurlers will also face off in the Richie McElligott Cup quarters at Owenbeg tonight (7.30pm). On the Down seniors’ near-miss in the Joe McDonagh, Sheehan said: “For three minutes on Saturday night we were in the final. Meath had to beat Kerry by five points to put us through and Kerry got a point in the seventh minute of injury-time… We had 54 points scored, as did Kerry, so it came down to goals scored and they scored three and we scored two so they went through to an All-Ireland final on goals scored.” Meanwhile, GPA Head of Operations and Finance Ciaran Barr (inset) has accused “some commentators” of trying to drive a wedge between the club and inter-county game and says one can’t survive without the other. Speaking at last night’s Gaelic Players’ AGM, the former Antrim hurler was miffed at how the expenditure on inter-county teams was viewed as a negative. “When I see the significant revenue generated by the inter-county games, I am surprised by the focus often on the ‘unsustainability’ of inter-county costs. “I find it difficult to square the two. Could we all be more efficient and effective with our investments and expenditure? Undoubtedly. “Are costs associated with inter-county games ‘unsustainable’? That’s a far more nuanced question to answer so let’s look at the revenue generated in 2019 v 2020. “In 2019, with a thriving inter-county game, the GAA generated record revenues, 83 cent in every euro of which was invested back into schools, clubs, counties and provinces. In 2020 revenues generated by the inter-county game fell off a cliff due to Covid-19…” Barr added: “The money spent on the inter-county game is not a cost; it’s an investment; an investment that all units of the GAA benefit from…”"

Bernard John Cash died as a result of injuries he suffered when he was struck by a Toyota Corolla at the Silverbridge halting site off the N11 in Bray, Co Wicklow, on July 17, 2018. An inquest at Dublin Coroner's Court yesterday heard evidence from the boy's mother, Bernadette Cash, that he had been struck by the front bumper of a vehicle driven by James Moorehouse before being run over by a front and rear wheel. However, Mr Moorehouse claimed he had been reversing his car out of a space between his house and a horsebox when the incident happened. He said he heard a ""bump"" as he was reversing and stopped when he heard someone scream. He drove the child and his mother to Loughlinstown Hospital as they did not want to wait for an ambulance. Coroner Dr Crona Gallagher acknowledged there were inconsistencies in the eyewitness testimony that could not be resolved. Forensic collision investigator Garda Cliff Harding said it was difficult to determine how the collision happened, but it most likely happened during some reversing manoeuvre around a corner. He said the vehicle would have struck the boy at low speed, but it was difficult to state exactly what part of the car had initially made contact. He said there was a trace element of blood on the front axle on the passenger side of the vehicle, which would indicate it had come in contact with the child. Gda Harding agreed his findings did not support the evidence of Bernard's mother, but also said ""both scenarios were possible"". He said motorists in the halting site should expect to see children playing around them and be aware of such a hazard. Garda Paddy Beere told the inquest two files on the case in relation to Bernard's death and the issue of intoxication were forwarded to the DPP, who had directed there should be no prosecution due to insufficient evidence. Gda Beere said the location of the incident was not a public road, while a view was taken that it was not in the public interest to initiate a prosecution as Mr Moorehouse had driven after the collision because he was trying to save a child's life. The evidence prompted a walkout from the hearing by Bernard's father, Bernard Joyce, who was attending the inquest by video link, and his uncle, John Joyce, who was present in court. Dr Gallagher stressed that as a coroner she was precluded from going into evidence about toxicology tests. In a written statement, Ms Cash said her son had been pestering her before the incident to feed some chickens. Ms Cash, who did not attend the inquest, told gardaí it looked like Bernard's leg had been broken but he remained breathing. As they were going to hospital, Ms Cash said she initially thought her son's neck was broken and she could see tyre marks on his face. Mr Moorehouse claimed he had collapsed after the child had been passed to paramedics and he could not remember anything that happened subsequently. The child was transferred to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin for treatment, but was pronounced dead a short time later. Dr Gallagher said a postmortem examination established Bernard had died as a result of severe head injuries that were ""unsurvivable"". The coroner said he had also suffered fractures to his ribs, which supported evidence he was struck by a vehicle and driven over by a tyre. Returning a verdict of accidental death, Dr Gallagher said she was satisfied Bernard had died as a result of injuries suffered in a low-speed collision. She accepted the inquest was unable to examine the precise manner in which the incident had happened. Outside the hearing, John Joyce criticised the garda investigation into his nephew's death and claimed there were ""still too many unanswered questions"".

Moore Street was the scene of the final surrender of the 1916 rebels and is located close to the GPO in O'Connell Street. Dunbar, who stars as senior anti-corruption police officer Ted Hastings in the award-winning BBC show, recorded a video supporting the campaign to save Moore Street. In the video Mr Dunbar says: ""I would like to say congratulations and well done to the relatives of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation and the Moore Street Preservation Trust on the launch of their plan for the preservation of the Moore Street battlefield site. ""Best of luck and I will see you in the future."" Campaigners have been fighting for decades to save 1916 sites on the street. Moore Street Preservation Trust spokesman James Connolly Heron said: ""If the Hammerson plans are granted permission and allowed to proceed, the Moore Street 1916 battlefield site would become a building site for at least 15 years. ""This is the time being applied for by the company to complete the Moore Street side of its overall project, which also includes O'Connell Street. ""In no way should this multinational company be allowed to subject our city centre to this for a decade-and-a-half. ""The Hammerson plan would partly demolish and split in two the historic terrace 10-25 Moore Street, which was occupied by the evacuated GPO garrison in 1916. ""The remaining buildings would be dwarfed by seven and nine-storey buildings housing hotels and offices."" Graphic   Actress Saoirse RonanCampaign: Adrian Dunbar"

That rapid growth will of course yield more and better-paid jobs, but there does appear to be a growing disconnect between those GDP numbers and actual economic outcomes for many people. We should be looking at the pace of job creation as the true measure of success in our post-Covid economy. While the number of people out of work is expected to fall dramatically from its peak, the ESRI says that 176,000 will still be jobless next year and that the unemployment rate average will be 7.1pc. By the end of next year, some may have been without work for more than two years having entered a high unemployment labour force as young people. After the devastation of the financial crisis there was a robust jobs recovery fuelled by foreign investment, but it still took seven years to the end of 2019 to create 468,000 jobs. We already know that lockdowns have hit younger and less well-off workers hardest, while the Government has done an extremely good job in supporting incomes in the face of an unprecedented shock. In May last year, more than 600,000 workers were in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payments. Despite complaints from some employers that people are drawing benefits instead of returning to work, the evidence shows that once lockdown restrictions were lifted, hundreds of thousands of people went back to work. By September last year, the number of PUP claimants had fallen to 210,000. A tougher lockdown at the start of this year pushed that number back up again to 486,000, but it had declined again by May to 310,000 as the economy reopened. Although wages were growing at a healthy clip before the pandemic kicked in, with average weekly earnings rising 3.9pc in 2019, it took five years of strong growth to get there. Even with that pay recovery and 300,000 more people at work by the first quarter of 2020, income's share of gross national product remained steady over the five years at around 38pc. Worryingly, even after all of the post-crisis growth, jobs creation and wage gains, the income gap between the richest and poorest is very wide at a pretax level when compared with our European peers. A recent study by Ciarán Nugent of the Nevin Economic Research Institute found that earnings for the top 10pc here are almost four times those of the bottom 10pc, the biggest gap by far in the European Union. Ireland's redistributive tax system results in a far more equal outcome, but you do have to ask whether, to some extent at least, the system is subsidising the creation of low-paying jobs. The Nevin study also shows a widening gap between the wages of those under 30 and the average, with the younger workers on 72pc of the average in 2006 and 65pc by 2018. Of course, there are many factors at play - the crash destroyed a swathe of construction jobs which may skew outcomes, and the successful creation of high-paying jobs is going to shift relative outcomes, but the direction of travel is not healthy over the long term, and at a time when the pandemic is exacerbating existing inequalities. You don't have to be a trade unionist to recognise the issues in the labour market - JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon sounded a warning in his recent letter to shareholders. Employers body Ibec has called for an investment in labour market activation measures as well as measures to prevent long-term unemployment. While crisis-era policies socialised bank losses and forced austerity on the population, this time we need to socialise gains from growth.

The report, by consultants InterVistas, has been lodged with Fingal County Council by Dublin Airport operator DAA in its bid to have two restrictions attached to the 2007 planning permission for its new runway removed. The planning conditions specify that the runway will not be used at night between 11pm and 7am and that night-time operations at the airport not exceed 65 flights on average when the airport runway is complete. The runway is expected to be operational next year, and InterVistas warn that if the planning restrictions are not removed the economic impact would reach a high in 2023, with 5,170 jobs and EUR 392 million in gross domestic product (GDP) lost. ""To put this into context, the number of jobs forgone at its peak in 2023 is higher than the total employment of either Google or Facebook in Ireland,"" the report says, and the airport would also lose out on a cumulative 6.3 million passengers between 2022 and 2025. The InterVistas report said the two planning restrictions attached to the 2007 permission were ""particularly problematic due to the significant negative implications they pose for the potential of the airport to operate, grow and deliver the maximum economic and societal benefit"". InterVistas submitted an initial report on the economic impact when plans were first lodged last December and submitted an updated report in May to reflect the Covid-19 impact on projected traffic. Early morning departure  The consultants said that the operating restrictions in the 2007 permission ""particularly impact on the recovery and growth of Ryanair and Aer Lingus who require early morning departure and late evening arrivals for their short-haul operations"". The report estimates that the impact of the restrictions would extend across the entire economy due to the lower connectivity that Dublin Airport would be able to offer. In an objection to the airport operator's plan to lift restrictions on the runway, Minister for Children and Dublin West TD Roderic O'Gorman branded as ""unacceptable"" the noise levels that local residents would be faced with if the planning restrictions were lifted. However, the airline industry has thrown its weight behind the plans with 15 carriers - including Dublin Airport's two main customers, Ryanair and Aer Lingus - offering their support."

It will mean the EU has reached an agreed position after months of consideration, and will be a strong advocate for designating the two marine protected areas (MPAs) stretching over 3 million sq km when world superpowers and signatory countries meet under Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in China next October. Efforts to agree the MPAs, which would also play a role in helping to address the climate threat in Antarctica, have been stalled because of reluctance on the part of Russia and China - though there are recent indications the latter will now support the move.  Vital food  There are oil reserves in Antarctica, while its seas are heavily fished for krill, used in cosmetics and to generate Omega-3 fish oils. Krill are a vital food source for whales, seals, ice fish, and penguins, and considered a ""keystone"" species that helps define the entire ecosystem of the southern ocean. The European Parliament resolution originated from its environment committee and was drafted and tabled by the Irish MEP Grace O'Sullivan - the Green Party's spokeswoman for the marine.  It backs a commitment of European Commission president Ursula Von Der Leyen made last September. G7 countries recently called for MPAs in 30 per cent of the world's marine space by 2030. ""The approval of these MPAs would contribute to achieving EU and global commitments on protecting marine biodiversity,"" Ms O'Sullivan said. ""This would create one of the largest marine protection areas in history."" The detailed resolution jointly proposed with French MEP Catherine Chabuad also expresses full support for efforts made by Australia, Norway, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, United States and New Zealand in preparation for the annual CCAMLR meeting.  This will ""intensify their bilateral and multilateral efforts to secure support for the establishment of these MPAs in the forthcoming months, and in particular to focus on CCAMLR members which have expressed opposition to the MPA proposals"", Ms O'Sullivan said. On the 60th anniversary of the coming into force of the Antarctic Treaty, the vote will send a strong message in potentially securing ""the greatest act of marine protection in history"".  ""Antarctica holds a special place in my heart. It's 35 years since I first set foot on Antarctic ice as a young Greenpeace activist, so it's a poignant moment for me,"" Ms O'Sullivan said at a briefing.  Impact  Meanwhile, the European Parliament is set to also approve the ""eighth Environment Action Programme"" on which Ms O'Sullivan was the parliament's chief negotiator.  This is ""system-changing environment legislation"", she said, that would be in place for the next decade.  It addressed the economic and societal impact of climate change, ecosystem degradation and overconsumption of natural resources while placing great emphasis ""the polluter pays"", she said. It was ambitious around areas such as moving beyond GDP to a sustainable wellbeing economy, and finally phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies, she added.  These relate to fossils fuels and in some instances agriculture where they are shown to give rise to harm."

The 17-year-old netted twice as WEXFORD YOUTHS beat ATHLONE TOWN 3-1 on Saturday night. Midfield general Molloy is always a joy to watch when in full flow but some of her performances are utterly jawdropping and this was one of those. The Kilkenny native dictated the tempo of this encounter. But it was the quality of her second goal - a free-kick that she earned - that is quickly becoming an online hit. Wexford remain unbeaten since Stephen Quinn stepped in to replace Tom Elmes. But they made hard work of this win after Katelyn Keogh pulled one back for Athlone. Molloy had put the visitors in front and it required a sprinkling of her magic - plus a goal from team-mate Ciara Rossiter - to see off a battling Athlone side. DLR WAVES beat second-from-bottom CORK CITY 1-0 thanks to a late goal from Ciara Maher. The clock was ticking into its 88th minute when Maher produced a fine finish that lobbed Cork keeper Abby McCarthy to gift the three points to the hosts. Up to that point it not clear if either team was capable of clinching it with a winner. DLR registered 15 shots on goal, Cork unloaded 12. DLR had 44 per cent possession, Cork had 56 per cent - so this was a close game. McCarthy, who was recalled to the starting line-up, pulled off several excellent saves while she had the crossbar to thank for keeping out Jess Gleeson's shot. Cork will feel that they deserved at least a point but they could not find a breakthrough. PEAMOUNT UNITED , who top the table from Shelbourne on goals scored, bagged a 2-0 win over BOHEMIANS. United lost to Shels last week and were determined not to slip up again. And that was bad news for Bohs, who did push them hard. The champions went into this one without defender Della Doherty, who completed a surprise switch to Wexford Youths. But she was not needed as Peamount took control early on. Captain Áine O'Gorman headed them in front before the interval and then wrapped things up with a left-footed finish late on - bringing her personal tally to eight goals for the season. Bohs huffed and puffed but rarely had their opponents panicking. There was a 2-2 draw as midtable sides TREATY UNITED and GALWAY WFC clashed. Treaty are developing a resilient streak and they showcased it in Jackman Park yesterday. Late goals from Gillian Keenan and Jenna Slattery ensured they grabbed a point. But it was their overall effort that really impressed. The away team struck first through Lynsey McKey and looked to be in control when Meabh de Burca converted a second-half penalty. But Treaty did not give up. Galway had Ireland international Julie-Ann Russell in their line-up and looked good in patches, but their rhythm will come in time under new boss Stephen Lally.

T The negative telling of England's road to the European Championship final can be spun as a tale of home-town crowds and a dodgy penalty, with the added advantage of minimal travel on the kind side of the draw. But there's nothing fortunate about the broader journey that appears to be culminating with regular presence at the business end of major tournaments. If Gareth Southgate's side do the business tomorrow, they will be adding senior glory to the U-17 and U-20 World Cups wins in 2017, the same year where claimed European success at U-19 and reached the semi finals of the U-21 equivalent. Look across the past decade and it's a story of gradual progression, a new confidence borne out of heavy investment in tandem with a defined strategy. Former England boss Steve McClaren predicted earlier this week that the next ten years could be dominated by his homeland and while we tend to scoff at such bold predictions in these parts, a standpoint borne out of years watching our neighbours crash and burn at the final hurdles, there are knowledgeable figures involved in the game here that now feel that the belief is justified. Even if they flounder against Italy, the foundations are established to ensure they will come again. Shelbourne technical director Alan Caffrey, who left his old job in charge of top schoolboy nursery St Kevin's Boys earlier this year, remembers the day he realised England were about to become a proper force. It was back in 2012 when they appointed Dan Ashworth as their new director of elite development. Ashworth was academy director at West Brom when Caffrey worked there in the 2000s and he knew England were appointing the real deal. ""I remember emailing him when he got the job and saying, 'Oh my God, England are actually going to be successful now,'"" laughs Caffrey. ""When you meet Dan, he's got a clear vision of what he wants and where he is. And he is strategic in terms of how you're going to do it and how you get the right people - and good people - into the job. ""In that role, it's about having a plan and a good relationship with people and then getting them to go out there and carry it out. Whoever made the decision to appoint Dan can take a lot of credit for what's happened now because I knew when he went there they were going to start pulling things together."" Ashworth's appointment by the FA was hugely significant but the wheels for improvement were already in motion because of developments that were happening at club level. England's rise and the emergence of a dressing-room stacked with talent is a product of the immense wealth of the Premier League belatedly being channeled in a way that can benefit their national side. Portions of the cash flowing into a sport propped up by ginormous TV revenues were diverted to where it was needed. Ged Roddy was the architect of the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) that was released in 2012 when he was the Premier League's director of football development. There was depth to the plan, which dealt with age group activity from U-9 up to U-23 level, but the central aspect of it was the categorisation of academies across English football and the introduction of demanding criteria. Critics of the proposal said it was weighted far too heavily towards Premier League clubs, with compensation rules allowing them to pick up players cheaply from smaller entities that may have produced them. Controversy lingers around that. Indeed, a trend of recent years is operations such as Brentford, Huddersfield and Wycombe effectively scrapping their academies because they couldn't compete with the big boys. Destination By contrast, Brighton and Hove Albion, a popular destination for Irish teens from these shores, is an example of an outfit that has risen to the challenge and created an academy facility that has wowed observers within England and further afield. ""When the EPPP was set up, it was about setting up a criteria of excellence,"" says John Morling, the head of Brighton's academy and a familiar name in Irish football circles after a seven-year spell with the FAI where he managed the U-15, U-16 and U-17 international sides and headed up the Emerging Talent programme. ""If you wanted to be Category 1, you needed to have a certain number of pitches and staff, an indoor area, an education department and other boxes that had to be ticked. It had to be really high level. If you couldn't quite reach those levels you would go to Category 2 or Category 3 or Category 4. There was massive investment in resources and facilities to ensure clubs could fit into those criterias and there was a ring-fenced budget available there with funding from the Premier League if you met them. ""Suddenly, every club had to be player development-orientated. The whole set-up is more structured, professional and accountable. You get audited all the time. You might be Category 1 but you get audited every two or three years to make sure you're doing what you say."" The investment led to an increase in training time and hours at all levels and a Premier League-funded elite coach apprenticeship scheme that naturally improved the situation on the ground. Results speak for themselves in terms of the quality and style of players that are now announcing themselves on a global stage. Morling says the evidence is there when you see the depth of Southgate's squad and that's before considering the players left out and the production line coming through. Foden, Saka, Sancho, Grealish and co have changed the image of the English player abroad. On Thursday night in Oriel Park, Dundalk playmaker Will Patching reflected on his 13 years in the Manchester City academy. He trained with Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden on a regular basis and Marcus Rashford was a frequent teenage opponent. Patching was tipped for the top at one stage but he's rebuilding his career now after a challenging patch. Standing out in a hugely competitive field has really asked questions of players of his generation. ""It's crazy to think what players who were around the same age group as me have experienced in such a short period of time,"" says the 22-year-old, who is a joy to watch when in full flight. Jack Byrne was a team-mate too, evidence of how clubs like City are adept at nurturing a particular type of player. ""Go back 10 or 15 years and people always say English lads are not technically as good as their European counterparts,"" says Morling. ""But now in Europe they want young English players."" Growth Ashworth's move to the FA was linked in with an attempt to build on what the clubs were about to do. The growth of a world-class training facility at St George's Park can be traced back to the early 2000s and Howard Wilkinson's attempts to replicate the famous French base in Clarefontaine. It's a high-performance hub that plays host to sides from all codes, including the Irish rugby team prior to the 2015 World Cup. A year earlier, Ashworth introduced the concept of the English DNA which was about delivering consistency across the national teams at all levels. This was extended to style of play, talent identification, and the other fundamentals that would underpin the path forward. At the launch, he was joined by then U-21 boss Southgate who spoke about the importance of speed. His words have aged well. ""The big thing that has changed at that level is the athletic capabilities you need,"" says Morling. ""The pace at which they can break is phenomenal."" Caffrey watched on enviously, knowing Ashworth had the skills to knit it all together. ""Dan was ridiculed for the English DNA thing. But he looked at the coaching structure; the coaching badges and felt it didn't reflect on modern football,"" he says. ""He looked at the staffing structure, he felt a lot of people had been there a long time which tends to happen in FAs and that needed to be changed and restructured. ""For a long time in England, it was clubs against country and he managed to marry that. 'This is what you're doing, now tell us what you're doing and we'll meet.' He was able to do that successfully on the basis of having been an academy manager and technical director and he knew the frustrations of the clubs when lads went to international football."" St George's Park was the perfect home to sell a new vision and promising players - including then Irish international Declan Rice - were invited to tour there when they began to show promise. Structures Ashworth left the FA in 2018 to take up a new role as technical director of Brighton, where Morling now works with him day to day. Caffrey reckons that his old friend had achieved everything he needed to do with England, knowing the right structures were in place as he began. The legacy of the various initiatives is a fit-for-purpose system that suits the local landscape; there's a flawed tendency to call for a copycat approach when things click for a particular country but if there's any lesson to be learned from England it's that they found a method to maximise their (deep) resources. Within that, individual clubs have the freedom to do things their way. ""Everyone has different philosophies and I can only speak for what we do,"" says Morling, who is an important figure from an Irish perspective with recent recruits Evan Ferguson, Andrew Moran, Leigh Kavanagh and James Furlong coming through their ranks and following in the footsteps of Aaron Connolly and Jayson Molumby. ""We don't play the same system in all of our teams. If we have two good wingers, we'll play wingers. There always has to be room for good players, no matter what type we are. There are always trends in the game. So much of it is about speed now but when we get around to Qatar next year or the World Cup in America four years after that there will be other trends. ""What we have is principles that stay the same. Every club has their own DNA but collaboratively what we can see is the amount of investment that went in ten years ago is bearing fruit and it's still evolving."" Football coming home may depend on the outcome of the decider. But whatever happens, it appears England has finally got its house in order.

Highest employment rates are amongst ICT course graduates. ""Almost 90pc of Springboard+ courses were already available in a blended format, with all going fully online in autumn 2020, ensuring that access was available to all, and people could engage with course con- tent in a safe manner."" Vivienne says course providers have been very reactive to new and emerging skills arising from the pandemic. ""Some new and emerging skills that became evident are health innovations and digital healthcare. Others include digital sales, web marketing for the tourism and hospitality sector, mental health recovery, and logistics. ""In addition, there are emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, agri-innovation, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, machine learning, drones and smart agri-sensors. There's a particular focus on climate change and sustainability, with courses such as energy and environmental infrastructure, decarbonisation, sustainable development, and bioenergy. Discipline areas include: ICT; business, management; entrepreneurship; manufacturing, biopharma, medtech, Hospitality, Tourism. There is also a focus on cybersecurity programmes, where there is a significant skills shortage nationally."" This year, there are 11,535 places available on 330 Springboard+ courses, and 1,869 places on 79 HCI Pillar 1 courses. The majority of courses will be offered online. However, there is hope that providers will have the flexibility to allow a greater presence on campus, particularly for courses that have a lab-based component or team project work. Any changes will be in adherence to public health guidelines. REMAINING RELEVANT Vivienne says that the pandemic has shone a light on the importance of lifelong learning, commenting, ""The world of work is constantly changing Over the past 10 years, 38% of course participants are over the age of 40. and evolving due to advances in technology. The pandemic has accelerated some of these advances, such as the requirement of businesses to go fully online, and health data analytics, for example. ""A Springboard+ course gives people the opportunity to improve their skillset in areas of new skill needs in their organisation, but also to gain new skills to further their career or return to the labour market."" Vivienne adds, ""To remain relevant in the workplace, we need to ensure the opportunities are there for everyone to upskill and ensure that no one is left behind. It is also vital that employers give employees the opportunity to take the time to upskill and ultimately, this is of benefit to the employer."" Looking forward to the next 10 years of Springboard+, Vivienne says the ultimate goal is to remain relevant and ensure that the programme evolves with the needs of the Irish economy. ""Hopefully, Springboard+ will continue to be as successful and continue to change people's lives as it has been doing over the last 10 years!"" own keep On average, there have been 250 courses per year, with an average of 41 providers per year.

The French government backs a target to reduce emissions from cars 55pc by 2030 and for hybrids to remain on the market for longer, an official in President Emmanuel Macron's office said. It was reported last week the European Commission plans to require emissions to fall by 65pc from 2030 and drop to zero from 2035. The official, who asked not to be identified per government policy, commented after Mr Macron met with top executives at auto companies including Stellantis NV and Renault SA, as well as labour representatives to discuss the transition to electric vehicles. The country will also consider fresh support for the industry to help it adopt new technology, the official said. The French position could signal a battle is brewing within the EU over new climate targets. The effective ban on combustion engines by 2035 is part of an ambitious plan to align the region's economy with more aggressive climate targets. It would also mean a faster phasing-out of hybrids than some executives and labour officials expected. ""We know there will be no choice but to switch to electric cars,"" said Jean-Marie Robert, a representative of the CFDT labor union, who attended the meeting. ""What's important is that we prepare in advance."" The new EU emission targets would be significantly stricter than existing fleet-wide goals requiring a 37.5pc emissions reduction by 2030. While the auto industry has been bracing for tougher rules, the meeting with Mr Macron was part of an effort to gain support for a slower phasing out of combustion engines. La Plateforme Automobile (PFA), France's main lobby group for the industry, estimates (EURO)17.5bn in investment is needed in the country by the middle of the decade to develop batteries, charging stations and related services. The phasing-out of combustion engines could lead to a loss of roughly 100,000 auto jobs in France through 2035 and the shutdown of manufacturing sites, according to a PFA presentation. The industry directly employs about 190,000 people currently. Production of electric and fuel cell vehicles are less labour-intensive compared with hybrids and those with diesel engines, the PFA said. France lags behind countries including Germany and the US in terms of the number of robots used by the auto industry, and French workers are more expensive than staff in eastern and southern European countries. Stellantis, the auto giant formed via the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group, last week said it plans to spend (EURO)30bn to deliver fully electric vehicles where demand, state support and regulatory pressure is highest. Rival Renault has also unveiled a plan for an EV and battery hub in northern France and a phasing out of combustion engines.

The European Commission forecast yesterday that Ireland's gross domestic product (GDP) would rise by 7.2pc in 2021, second only to Romania's at 7.4pc, and well above the EU and euro area average of 4.8pc. Irish growth will fall back to 5.1pc in 2022, compared to 4.5pc in the EU and eurozone, ""on the back of the partial unwinding of the very large household savings accumulated during the long and very strict lockdowns"", the Commission said in its summer forecast. Inflation will remain below the European Central Bank's 2pc target, at 1.5pc in 2021 and 1.2pc in 2022. The figures are an upward revision on previous EU forecasts, but are more conservative than last week's Central Bank of Ireland forecast of 8.3pc growth this year. But changes to global tax rules and ""the impact on trade"" from an ongoing row with the UK over the implementation of the Brexit deal in Northern Ireland pose risks to the forecast. Last week Ireland opted out of a global corporate tax deal brokered by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) due to ""reservations"" about a 15pc minimum rate on the largest multinationals. A planned EU digital tax also threatens to throw a spanner in the works, as the US is against singling out its big technology firms. The EU has delayed its draft until after a G20 finance ministers' meeting on Friday, but the US wants the bloc to hold off until later this year. And US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is reportedly going to push for an even higher global minimum tax at the G20 meeting. The US is currently debating its own legislation that would tax American multinationals' global profits at 21pc. ""Of course, we want to have the best possible cooperation with our American partners and friends,"" EU economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters in Brussels yesterday. ""We will avoid any interference and undermining of this kind of proposal in relation to the global discussion that we are contributing to, and we are very optimistic this global discussion can reach first results even already this week,"" The Commission predicts all 27 of the EU economies will expand this year. Ireland was the only EU member to record positive GDP growth in 2020, thanks to exports from multinationals. Mr Gentiloni said the bloc will meet its target of vaccinating 70pc of adults before the summer is out, and added that there are no immediate risks to the recovery from new lockdowns as a result of the Delta Covid variant. ""We can see exceptions, but we don't see a tendency toward new restrictions. We see a tendency towards easing existing restrictions,"" he said. ""This is the situation right now. Of course, there is only one certainty at [this] time and the certainty is that the vaccination campaign is progressing, that we can reach our target even before the end of the summer, and that we have to go faster in this at global level.

The European Commission had initially been set to unveil plans for the digital tax this week. The measure was endorsed by EU leaders last year as a way to pay down its joint EU borrowing undertaken to fund a EUR 750 billion Covid-19 stimulus fund.

The Irish Government has refused to join the G7 and G20 in backing proposals for an overhaul of company taxation that would set a 15 per cent floor for corporation tax, warning that it may cost the exchequer more than EUR 2 billion a year.  Ireland's corporation tax is 12.5 per cent.  However, Mr Donohoe indicated that Irish support for the corporate tax could be possible after he met with Dr Yellen.

The move comes after finance ministers from the world's 20 largest economies (G20), which includes the US and EU members like France and Germany, agreed to tax multinational profits at least 15pc and award partial taxing rights to countries where multinationals make sales. The EU is leaving its options open and says it may reassess the plan, although it has been shelved until at least a G20 leaders' summit at the end of October.

""In this framework, I informed Secretary Yellen of our decision to put on hold the proposal of the Commission of a digital levy to allow us to be concentrated, working hand in hand, to achieve the last mile of this historical agreement."" The US wants countries like France, Spain and Italy to remove national taxes on tech companies once a final tax deal is worked out at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is leading global talks. Ms Yellen said at the weekend that those taxes are ""discriminatory against US firms"". The US agreed to come back on board with the OECD talks earlier this year, on the condition that the tax covered all multinationals and not just Big Tech. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the EU's decision to back down was ""a sign that we are now really making the progress to get a global agreement"".

A Let me swiftly renew full support for citizens' aspirations to have a proper pint in a proper pub sooner rather than later. But like a lot of us, I see the nagging-doubtdepartment and a potential ""Delta dawn"" rapidly sowing worry all across the European Union. Dr Ronan Glynn tells us that seven out of 10 new Irish Covid cases are now of the Delta variety, and it already accounts for the majority of new cases in many European countries, driving infection rates up to their highest level for months. In Brussels and the other major EU capitals, where they were contemplating the boost of a quick-time economic rebound, the economists are now minded to revise downward their growth forecasts. While another major lockdown seems unlikely just yet in most countries, after 18 months of up and down fear, people are invoking their own restraints on movement. Just last week, the European Commission had raised its EU growth forecasts for 2021 to 4.8pc after a record contraction of 6.2pc last year. Experts noted that such a prediction would be the most rapid expansion seen since 1976 and could see the EU's economy regain its pre-pandemic output levels by the end of 2021. But last weekend, Germany and France warned their citizens against travel to Spain, where Covid infection rates raced ahead of already alarming rises in Portugal to become the highest on mainland Europe. Such bad news dealt a hammer blow to the tourism sector at the start of a truncated summer season that followed one totally shut down in 2020. Spain lost 80pc of tourist revenue in 2020 and their economists had based more hopeful projections for this year on clawing that back to at least 50pc of the revenue in a normal or pre-Covid-19 year. But the Delta variant has since raised serious doubts about what just weeks ago seemed like modest enough Spanish aspirations. Privately there is talk about the potential for more virus constraints which will further seriously disrupt tourism. But Spain still hopes to continue in the holiday business with hospitalisation rates rising only fractionally and vaccination rates out-stripping infection rates. The Portuguese authorities have already said incoming holidaymakers must have proof of vaccination, or have a negative test, or have recovered from the virus, to stay in its hotels or eat inside restaurants in many areas. Authorities in the Netherlands have reintroduced restrictions on restaurants, bars, cafés, nightclubs and live events only two weeks after lifting them. Good news from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is death rates and the numbers in hospital remain stable. But infection rates are on the rise to 51.6 per 100,000 people last week, up from 38.6 the previous week. The silver lining is that 44pc of adults in the EU are now fully vaccinated."

The case is believed to centre on allegations of misleading investment advice and conflicts of interest due to Davy's advice in relation to client companies. The litigation was first filed in the High Court in 2014, although details of the allegations and McLoughlin's losses have not previously emerged. McLoughlin (81) is a plaintiff in the case, along with the Ray McLoughlin Approved Retirement Fund, and a number of other companies in which he is the majority shareholder. These companies are Monset, Duneeda Ireland and Duneeda Investments. McLoughlin was formerly chief executive of holding company James Crean, and Monset was the vehicle he used to acquire that company. It is understood that McLoughlin's case outlines losses amounting to over 90pc of the average purchase price of the stocks, which included Bank of Ireland. It is alleged that Davy continued to promote certain stocks despite compelling evidence that the decline in these stocks would continue. It is claimed that other leading investment analysts would have been negative on the stocks. Stocks on which the litigation is based were all client companies of Davy and these companies during this period were paying the broker substantial sums in relation to brokerage services, corporate finance services and fund management services Davy would have been an adviser to most of Ireland's high-profile companies over the past number of decades. Although the case was first filed in 2014, it is not known if Davy has yet filed a defence. In January of this year, the company sought an extension of time to file its defence. Over the past 18 months, affidavits have been filed by McLoughlin and director of legal at Davy, Evelyn O'Donnell. Solicitors Daniel Spring are acting for McLoughlin while McCann Fitzgerald is acting for J&E Davy. McLoughlin was a close friend of Kyran McLaughlin the joint former managing director of Davy. Both played for Blackrock College rugby club in the 1960s. McLoughlin, who was born in Ballinasloe, Co Galway, played rugby for Connacht and UCD, where he studied chemical engineering. He later worked for the IDA and was capped 40 times by Ireland. Davy declined to comment when contacted, although a robust defence is expected given McLoughlin's business acumen. The firm is currently being sold in a process being run by Rothschild & Co, and market sources believe that Bank of Ireland remains the front-runner in the process. The sale was prompted by the fallout from a Central Bank fine in relation to an Anglo bond deal. It also led to the departures of McLaughlin as deputy chairman of Davy and Brian McKiernan as CEO. As major shareholders in Davy, they will be significant beneficiaries of the sale. Any buyer will be keen to ring fence any liabilities that could arise in the future, so indemnification will be an important part of the negotiations.

Accounts for the company behind Tennant & Ruttle, Railford Investments, show that its turnover fell last year to (EURO)99.9m from (EURO)108.7m the year before.

The news comes after it emerged that the points needed for some high-demand courses will rise as students who sat the written Leaving Cert last November take up places now offered to them. Confirming that extra medicine and pharmacy places will be created, a spokesperson for Mr Harris was unable, however, to say how many. Last year, 2,250 extra places were created. Talks are under way between the Department of Further and Higher Education, the Higher Education Authority and the universities to "" identify where there is scope"" for additions, the official said. Meanwhile, the department emphasised to students that options beyond universities exist, including further education, training and apprenticeships.  ""For students who are not successful in gaining an offer for their course of choice in the first instance, there are alternate routes available to them to reach their preferred option,"" The Irish Times was told. The offers to 2020 applicants of places in higher-point courses this September because of improved results in last November's written exams is but one factor driving up points, according to one of Ireland's medical faculties. Pressure  However, a bigger issue in medicine and pharmacy courses is the doubling of applications from citizens in other EU states, who no longer want to study in the United Kingdom. Pressure on the CAO points requirements is also exacerbated by the structure of the assessment process now in place for the 2021 Leaving Certificate class. The State Examinations Commission is currently standardising the marks submitted by teachers for their classes, ahead of the marking of scripts submitted by some of those students in written exams. The assessed grade process, which took place in 2020, resulted in a profile of awards which at higher levels were on average 10 per cent ahead of 2019, resulting in a substantial increase in CAO points requirements in many courses.  The decision by the Mr Harris to create more than 2,000 extra places reduced the net effect of this grade inflation to an average of 5 per cent in many high-points courses. Once the assessed grades process is completed in August the results, for any student whose grade in any written paper taken in June 2021 is better than the standardised one, will be amended upwards.  Grade inflation  However, admissions experts expect that students who participated fully in the June written exams will be awarded higher CAO results than they received by assessment, thus spurring grade inflation in 2021. This anticipated increase in CAO points requirements is of huge concern to the thousands of applicants who are competing for places based on previous Leaving Cert exams. It is also of great concern to Dr Rory O Sullivan, chairman of FET Colleges Ireland. ""Further Education and Colleges Ireland continues to be concerned that the grade inflation that occurred last year following the calculated grades system will be repeated this year.  In 2020 this grade inflation resulted in many FE students being significantly disadvantaged in receiving CAO offers. This was particularly the case with the Institutes of Technology, which inexplicably continue to place a 390 CAO points ceiling on further education applicants."

As I passed the Convention Centre Dublin in my yellow sou'wester and sturdy galoshes I heard a familiar call from within: ""Cuckoo! Cuckoo!""  It was July 7th.  Is this a broken record? - Yours, etc, Muriel Lard, Tara Street. Yes. Yes it is, now.  It's nothing usual to hear the cuckoo cry ringing around the convention centre these days. It used to be a lesser-spotted bird on the Dáil landscape, occasionally scared up by left-wing deputies and former TD Mick Wallace before he fell like a ton of bricks for the totalitarian charms of the Communist Party of China. Beware this nattily attired creature and its shameless exploitation of nest-builders trying to make a forever home, they warned the Government. It may fly on two wings, but both are aggressively right.  The politicians gave concrete examples of the fat cuckoos' rapacious ways. And while the last administration heard the stories with a sympathetic ear, little was done to discourage the widescale nest-occupation antics of the bully birds.  Then there were the vultures, also part of the profit-generating Financial Fund genus. They were regularly mentioned too. However, the Government and the like-minded experts it prefers to hear were disinclined to take action for fear it would upset the delicate ecosystem nurtured by its predecessors and the like-minded experts they preferred to hear.  But the cuckoos and vultures didn't go away. They just became more of a nuisance and when the scarcity of social and affordable housing became a full-blown crisis their presence could not be overlooked.  News a couple of months ago that an investment fund had bought up almost all the houses in a newly built estate in Co Kildare caused consternation at a time when people looking for a home of their own were being priced out of the market.  Such was the outcry at these funds sucking up swathes of apartments and starter homes and then leasing them back at a premium to thwarted buyers, the Coalition moved quickly to calm the situation.  In the Dáil, the Taoiseach expressed his concern at the situation, which he called ""unacceptable"". He was going to take prompt action. ""In respect of that swoop-in by that investor, we are going to deal with that."" Micheál Martin said he was going to make it clear to local authorities that he did not want to see them leasing their housing stock from investment funds. The practice was ""bad value"". He was also going to deploy his special (not silent but deadly) weapon: Darragh O'Brien, Minister for Housing.  As the Opposition and the public shouted for action the Coalition signalled its bona fides by promising ""a whole-of-government approach"", otherwise known as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, who agreed to slap a bit of tax on the cuckoos. The upshot was an announcement that individuals or funds buying more than 10 houses in a year would be hit with a surcharge of 10 per cent. But they could still run amok in the apartment business. ""A severe deterrent,"" said Paschal, firmly. ""G'way outta that,"" snorted the Opposition. It has been all of. . . well, weeks since that decisive action. And there has been a dispiriting development.  Mary Lou McDonald and Róisín Shortall were all over it when the Dáil resumed yesterday. We hadn't expected to hear the song of the cuckoo ring out in the convention centre so soon.  There is general gobsmackery among politicians - not confined to the Opposition benches, we hear - at the news that cuckoos and vultures scooping up properties and leasing them to local authorities will not now have to pay the piffling 10 per cent. Thanks to a dinky little amendment (more than three pages long) snuck into a Finance Bill primarily to do with Covid-19-related matters, the Dáil will vote the change through tonight.  Conveniently, the Bill can also butter up wealthy avian investors under the catch-all heading of ""miscellaneous provisions"".  So what was Micheál talking about two months ago?  ""I'm asking you, Taoiseach, simply to be true to what you said in May,"" requested Mary Lou.  ""This U-turn can only be described as brazen and downright dishonest,"" protested Róisín. Both party leaders reacquainted him with his words delivered very recently. On the face of it, the tasty new exemption clause - insinuated in glaringly quiet contrast to the introduction of the lightly restraining 10 per cent tax which required a special press conference for Darragh and Paschal in Government Buildings with full flags and fancy lecterns - looks embarrassing for the Government.  Not content with letting these funds snap up nearly all the apartments being built in Dublin, the Taoiseach is now ""incentivising"" them to buy up houses from under the noses of families and young people, charged the Sinn Féin leader.  ""The result of all of this, to be clear, is that aspiring home-buyers will continue to be priced out of the market by institutional investors who avail of sweetheart tax breaks gifted to them by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and, lest we forget, by the Labour Party in its time."" Róisín Shortall was equally scathing of this sudden change to a newly introduced measure. It's understandable; government doesn't usually move so quickly. Clearly when these vultures and cuckoos call, their cries are heard in the very highest places.  She recalled how he stressed to the Dáil that he would be making it very clear to local authorities that he did not agree with them entering into long leases with investment funds.  ""You didn't do a very good job of making it clear,"" she pointed out, given that his Minister for Housing had ""quietly submitted"" an amendment to encourage cuckoo funds to ""swoop in"" and elbow out buyers.  In May, the Government did ""the bare minimum"" required. ""You didn't even bother to include apartments and now we learn that even the bare minimum has been diluted.""  The Taoiseach was tetchy in his replies to both women. He defended the move because leasing to local authorities was of ""limited use"" because it helped provide emergency accommodation for homeless families.  This was not helping first-time buyers, said Shortall.  ""First-time buyers? They're not buying social houses,"" shot back Martin. The Social Democrat co-leader said she is aware of that, but the social houses leased by the powerful cuckoos could have been bought by first-time buyers if they were in a position to compete. The Government has big plans, said the Taoiseach. The focus will be on building houses. When the Housing for All plan is published it will reflect his and the Government's core policy platform.  The words ""when"" and ""will"" jumped out a lot.  But the cuckoos (and their clarion call) live in the moment.  Like a broken record."

Disgruntled backbench Fianna Fáil TDs are waiting for a leadership candidate to step forward before they sign a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach. Moves are under way within the party to convince TDs to sign a motion of no confidence in the leader. However, senior party figures are reluctant to do so until a candidate expresses their willingness to stand against Mr Martin. The Irish Independent has learned that at least three TDs are willing to sig n the motion of no confidence but it is believed eight would sign once a candidate steps forward. Dublin Bay South TD Jim O'Callaghan's leadership ambitions have been dented as a result of the by-election result in his constituency. Speaking yesterday, he said he was interested in being leader but would not be challenging Mr Martin in the short term. He also said he would not be signing a motion of no confidence in Mr Martin. Other front-runners, including ministers Darragh O'Brien and Michael McGrath, would also be reluctant to step up at a time when Mr Martin is just one year into a two-and-a-half year term as Taoiseach under the coalition deal with Fine Gael. Mr Martin has indicated he intends to lead the party into the next general election due in 2025 - but this is not viewed as a realistic prospect within his parliamentary party. Some TDs believe that if a potential candidate announces a bid, a significant number of TDs would be willing to sign the motion. However, other TDs believe that once Mr Martin was removed as leader, leadership candidates would then make themselves known. Mr O'Callaghan told RTÉ yesterday it was ""unlikely"" Mr Martin would lead the party into an election if one was to take place in 2024. However, Education Minister Norma Foley said there was no widespread support in the party for a heave against the Taoiseach and that Mr Martin could ""absolutely"" lead the party into the next election. Mr McGrath tweeted last night that the voters had ""given a message"" and ""this is not a time for us to be talking about ourselves"". ""To succeed, we need to support our Taoiseach, our team, work together, have unity of purpose and show the public that their concerns are our priorities at all times,"" he said. Debate within the party follows an abysmal showing in the Dublin Bay South by-election, with candidate Deirdre Conroy not reaching 5pc of the vote, Fianna Fáil's worst election result. Former agriculture minister Barry Cowen on Saturday demanded an emergency meeting of the parliamentary party, leadership and senior officials to discuss the ""alarming"" by-election result and last year's general election outcome. His call was broadly welcomed by party figures. If 10 signatures are collected from party TDs for a motion of no confidence, a submission can then be put to the party chief whip. Some TDs who spoke to the Irish Independent last night believe there will not be a heave because TDs are ""paralysed in fear"" at the prospect of a general election. However, one senior TD said there may not be enough votes among TDs to succeed with a motion of no confidence. A total of 19 TDs out of 37 would need to vote against the leader for it to succeed. ""If 40pc was reached, it would be very uncomfortable for the leader. I doubt it would even reach 19 in a secret ballot,"" they said. The source added that the party was in a ""very bad situation"" and that going into coalition with Fine Gael ""destroyed Fianna Fáil's identity"". TD Paul McAuliffe, said a ""small number of people are unhappy"" with Mr Martin's leadership. However he didn't see any alternative being put forward. However, Sligo Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry called on the Taoiseach to resign this summer and ""save us the motion of no confidence"".

I knew it off by heart. It encapsulated an undeniable truth that was at the core of Irish politics for eighty years. The words were uttered in the bar of the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin in 1992. The background noise of Irish public life at the time was an endless tribunal of inquiry into shenanigans in the beef industry and their governmental ramifications. Albert Reynolds, who was then taoiseach, was due to give his evidence. He was obsessed with the inquiry. He was worried in particular about being cross-examined under oath by one of the sharpest barristers in the business: the late Adrian Hardiman, then a senior counsel, later a Supreme Court judge. In the small world of the law library, one of Reynolds's own lawyers was a close friend of Hardiman. In the Shelbourne bar, he explained to Hardiman's wife why it would be a good idea for her husband to be unavoidably detained on the day of the taoiseach's cross-examination and leave the job to a more junior (and less dangerous) colleague. He uttered, by way of warning, a truth then universally acknowledged. Hardiman's ""future work and long-term interests could be affected if he carried out this cross-examination himself because the Fianna Fáil party was likely to be in power for a long time and had a long memory"". These were essential facts of Irish life. We hold these truths to be self-evident: Fianna Fáil is the permanent repository of power. It does not forget its friends - and it remembers its enemies even more clearly.  Political weather In this reality, there was little difference between power and the perception of power. So long as people believed that Fianna Fáil was going to be running the country far into the indefinite future, they had to accommodate themselves to that fact. Other parties might sometimes make the political weather. Fianna Fáil was the climate. In this, the party was very like the other institution to which it remained so closely allied: the Catholic church. The church, too, was likely to be in power for a very long time and had, if anything, an even longer memory. Together, these two forces formed the Irish matrix. For both organisations, this power was deeply corrupting. It meant that everything could be, in both senses, fixed. In the perpetual light that shone on these twin pillars of control, setbacks and scandals were temporary. The matrix would always regenerate itself. The problem with power based on the perception of its own perpetuity is that, as the ad says, when it's gone, it's gone. And for Fianna Fáil, it has been gone since 2008. The crash, and the consequent loss of national sovereignty, destroyed it. This process is cumulative. A byelection in which the party finishes fifth with fewer than 5 per cent of the votes is not just a disaster in itself. It makes Fianna Fáil look weak and a weak Fianna Fáil is the political equivalent of a homeopathic remedy - it is the watery memory of a once-potent substance. Without perpetual domination, ideology matters. In its pomp, Fianna Fáil could stand for everything and nothing because everybody knew what it really stood for: power. It could befriend the oligarch and the oppressed. These were mere shadows; the substance was control of the State. But turn the power off, and the shape-shifting becomes merely vacuous. The battery - you'd better be with us because we own the freehold on the inside track - goes flat. Who's afraid of Fianna Fáil now? Its enemies list is like that of Graham Norton's Father Noel Furlong in Father Ted - only joking! And conversely, who thinks that the way to advance in Irish life is to be in a party that had difficulty persuading even its own local councillors to put their names forward for the byelection? In the Irish body politic, Fianna Fáil is a vestigial feature - the tailbone or the appendix. These bits survive their own redundancy, but they have no function. We don't eat grass or have tails anymore, and we don't believe that there is a party that will always be in charge. Ritual slaughter  This problem is existential. To believe it can be solved by replacing Micheál Martin with Jim O'Callaghan or Michael McGrath is magical thinking: the crops have failed because the king has offended the gods, so let us ritually slaughter the king. Ritual slaughter would add greatly to the gaiety of the nation, but it will not save Fianna Fáil. It can carry on indefinitely as a ghost in its own electoral machine. It cannot, however, answer the question - what are we for? What is the purpose of a machine that has become obsolescent? It can only be displayed at fairs like a steam-powered threshing engine that exerts a nostalgic fascination but goes nowhere. Fianna Fáil has had two long lives. It created de Valera's Ireland. And it then created contemporary Ireland through the Whitaker-Lemass revolution of 1958.  The first is long gone. The second has run its course, as Ireland seeks a new paradigm. There will not be a third act. "

But that arterial road in south Dublin named in his honour tells its own story, as does a nearby park also bearing his name. Only much older political anoraks will recall the genial Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin South East, an area these days called Dublin Bay South, and the scene at the weekend of considerable political angst for the current three Coalition parties. Fine Gael and the Green Party have 'afters' to resolve from this by-election - but they will both take comfort from these being in the halfpenny place compared with Fianna Fáil's woes. Seán Moore's name harks back to an almost golden era for Fianna Fáil in this affluent and socially different constituency which, without exaggeration, has often 'belonged' to Fine Gael. Evoking Moore thus reminds us that in the 1960s and 1970s, into the early 1980s, Fianna Fáil could at times take two out of the four seats here. Nationally, Seán Moore's name has occurred as a backbencher who helped Charlie Haughey's swifter than expected rise to power in December 1979. His serious illness following his belated appointment as government chief whip also allowed a certain Bertie Ahern begin his climb of the political greasy pole surprisingly soon after his arrival at Leinster House. But enough of the history lessons. The story which emerged in last Friday's by-election count is that the people who used to lay the cornerstone of Fianna Fáil's surprise success in this atypical constituency were the working class voters in Irishtown, Ringsend and the inner city. And last week almost none of them could contemplate voting Fianna Fáil. It gets worse. One veteran Fianna Fáil campaigner has conceded that it was a struggle to find anyone under 50 prepared to vote for the party. Suddenly, revolt is again in the air as some people look to oust the party leader and Taoiseach Micheál Martin. The Taoiseach's supporters are wrong when they tell us that would-be rebels could not get the necessary 10 names to activate a motion of no confidence against the leader. The real problem is that with an electorate of 37 TDs, they could not get the necessary 19 votes to oust Mr Martin. So, such a move would only strengthen the leader's grip on the tiller. At all events, there are also two other simple realities. One is that Mr Martin's leadership is not the big problem - the party's overall lack of a message to resonate with voters is the issue. The second point is that there is no ready-made replacement for Mr Martin who could quickly lift their fortunes. Names of would-be leaders do not have anyone dancing in the aisles. Jim O'Callaghan, in self-imposed exile on the backbenches, is a barrister with five years' service as a TD, no government experience, and already had an uphill job to show leadership credentials. As the campaign director in a by-election which netted 5pc last week, his stock is driven even lower. Barry Cowen has potential but his family name evokes memories of who was on the Government bridge when the economy crashed in 2008. Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien is most unlikely to be able to show progress any time soon in overcoming the housing crisis. Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath is well qualified, but how does he show that taking over from his Cork South Central constituency colleague is about any kind of directional change? A big part of Fianna Fáil's problem is that political parties are now bunched on the left - not in the centre. Covid-19 has put a bit of pep into the pace of political change in Ireland. Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael is also making shapes to the left. In the immediate aftermath of the last election, Fianna Fáil's vote-share was only fractionally behind that of Sinn Féin, and a bit ahead of Fine Gael's. But just a few months later, Fine Gael were soaring way ahead of Mr Martin's party in opinion poll rankings. Spool on a few months from that and suddenly Fianna Fáil were beginning to look alarmingly like the junior coalition partners. The problem most acutely manifested last week in Dublin Bay South recurs with varying degrees of gravity across the capital and other parts of the country. Down the years, veteran Fianna Fáilers in puckish mode like to jeer the junior coalition partner, often Labour, as being ""political mudguards"". The term has a particular cutting quality when it is applied to their own current situation these days. But it is being quietly used within Fianna Fáil right now. ""Is being a mudguard for Fine Gael our only future option? If it is, and things are moving quickly right now, it may be time to start thinking about a merger,"" one party stalwart quietly confided to this writer in recent days. Talk of party mergers is often exaggerated and at best premature. But finding a workable message for Fianna Fáil right now is a very hard task indeed. You may well think that means they'll play for time and that further means this Coalition may yet run close to full term. Unless you're in Fine Gael and think it's time for an early cut and run. But a merger has its Fine Gael points too.

The Ballymote native has built up a remarkable CV, but being responsible for the fortunes of the picturesque little track nestled in the shadow of Ben Bulben is where Foley feels she was destined to be. This is her seventh season now, having taken on the job in 2015. She had left the land of Yeats, its heavenly beaches, lakes and megaliths, to study at UCD, where she graduated with a degree in economics and Italian. ""I worked in private business all my life,"" explains Foley. ""I worked for some big companies: Monsanto, Bank of America. I worked in America at one time as well, for the World Bank in Washington DC. So I have a wide business background. I worked abroad for years. I worked in the Middle East. I was in lots of different places. Then I came back to Dublin for a number of years. I was involved in IT training. ""Then I got an opportunity to come back to Sligo which I wanted to do. I moved down as a project manager with a localisation company. After some years doing that, I got a call that there was a vacancy here on the racecourse. I decided to apply and was lucky enough to get this position. ""Needless to say, when I compare my jobs in the past, this would be my very favourite, absolutely. It was a no-brainer. What an environment. It has its stress, but is a lot less stressful than working in financial areas and that type of thing. It's different challenges and a great variety. ""I look after more or less everything, apart from the fact we have a track manager, but I would be interested in the track as well. It is very interesting work. Then, of course, dealing with the public is terrific as well. I'm just waiting for that to happen again."" She didn't grow up around horses but is now surrounded by them, and not just at work. ""I don't come from a racing background, but I do have a racehorse. My father, over the last 10 or 15 years, got involved in horse racing, and he has a few horses as well. I live on the farm and I have horses around me all of the time. ""It's lovely to have that contact with horses and with animals. I think a lot of that, contact with horses, can help you get through just about anything. Especially during the pandemic, it is great to be able to go out and be so close to nature and animals and life. Horses, they'd lift your spirits."" Those healing powers were needed through testing times. She has a skeleton full-time staff but misses the casual workers, worries for them and appreciates their patience. But with no crowds, the opportunity was taken to address an issue that had cropped up around the bend and that work has received positive feedback from trainers and jockeys. There were other little improvements along the way, including around the parade ring and stableyard, and regular visitors will light up when they finally get back. And this is the thing. Sligo might not be a Grade 1 track, but it is a very important sporting and social venue in the region, attracting visitors who hang around and spend money in the hotels, bars, restaurants and other tourist attractions. Today's National Hunt card would invariably be at the core of a weekend buzz around Sligo and its environs but only 200 owners will be allowed attend along with essential industry people. ""The racing in Sligo attracts a lot of people. All of our racing is during the summer season. A lot of people would have their holidays booked around the Sligo Races. We would have a huge influx from Northern Ireland. They would come down this week. Sligo would be full of tourists and there is quite a lot of disappointed people, ringing me now for over a week to see if we would be able to open up or what the protocols were,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, I am not ready for them this weekend. Hopefully we will get there. Because of our location, so close to the Northern counties, people come down frequently. They book into the local hotels for a few days or a week, people enjoy coming to the town. It is very vibrant for the summer. We miss that a lot."" The connection with the local business community, as well as the general population, is evident in the sponsors' profile, many of which are from the hospitality industry. It is no surprise that she has so much praise for the Irish Horse Racing Regulatory Board (IHRB) and Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) for keeping racing going for all bar three months of the pandemic, with a blemish-free record of Covid transmission from the tracks. ""Obviously, financials have taken a hit, our turnover is down, but we are still able to continue. The fact we were able to race behind closed doors, it kept the industry going. ""The IHRB and the HRI, they were the people that, very carefully, stated the protocols. They did an amazing job. It really was a basis of the very strict protocols that horse racing was able to continue. It's a real credit there has been no major outbreak of Covid anywhere in Ireland in the horse racing areas since the beginning of the pandemic last year in March. They have worked really hard to communicate everything very clearly to the racecourses. ""In the initial stages, they sent people down to the tracks to assist them getting the place set up, advising them what to do and the best way to carry it out. They worked in conjunction with racecourses. We worked well together and so did the trainers and jockeys, and we have to be pleased with how it went."" And what about gender? Clearly there have been big advances in racing, like last week's confirmation that Suzanne Eade is to be appointed chief executive of HRI. There have been challenges along the way as a woman starting off in the financial world, but Foley doesn't dwell on them. ""I suppose there has been. Things are getting better, there is no question about that. Early on, there was hardly any women in management positions. But as time went on, girls were performing so well in every field, certainly in education. It was a no-brainer that you had to get women into management roles. And it has happened. It has been a credit to everybody to recognise that women should be moving up to the top. Of course we have had two female presidents in Ireland and that in itself is historic."" So she is looking forward to today, and later in the year, when the crowds will return for some of the hugely popular theme fixtures - Peaky Blinders, in particular, proving a hit. She praises her staff and her board, but it is Kathryn Foley who is captain of the ship. Ready to greet the passengers once more.

Many businesses are still in the dark as to when they will be let resume operations full-time. Talks between Ministers and the hospitality sector during the week over indoor dining have had limited success. They have focused on how the EU Digital Covid Certificate could be used to secure admission to bars and restaurants ? and how the new system could be policed. The passes are being sent to fully vaccinated people from Monday. But business owners want further engagement from the State if they are to meet the mooted July 19 date. Industry experts believe they face a race against time to be ready by then. Here, IBEC CEO DANNY McCOY, left, explains why negotiations need to be stepped up as a matter of urgency. THE Government's decision not to go ahead with the next phase of planned reopening has brought to a grinding halt the optimism that had been gradually emerging over the past number of weeks for businesses in the experience economy in Ireland. The experience economy encompasses hospitality, retail, travel, food, drink, tourism, entertainment and technology. It is a core component of the Irish business model, making the country a great place to live, work and invest. It reaches deep into the supply chain, supporting business and employment in many of the hard-to-reach but critical elements of the economy and society. IBEC is very concerned for the thousands of businesses and people working in this vital sector who have been placed in an impossible position by the lateness of Government's decision and the lack of clarity within it. While business acknowledges the health motivations of the decision, delaying the reopening of this significant part of our economy during peak holiday season without any indication of when they may safely reopen lacks perspective on those most impacted by the pandemic. This includes the consumer, be they senior citizens or young people, or the providers across the regions, be they large or small businesses who have been suppressed for well over a year. Give us certainty Given the seriousness of the recommendation by NPHET's Dr Tony Holohan for our economy and society, where an extended lockdown will result in the closure of many businesses and where workers will lose their livelihoods, it is intolerable that this long into the pandemic these businesses continue to receive vague clarifications around the reopening of their industry. Businesses require certainty on a reopening plan as quickly as possible and additional financial support for the extra costs that the mishandling of events in the past week has caused. Furthermore, it is important not to lose sight of the impact of the Government's decisions on the wider business community and the stability of our economy. Confidence amongst consumers and businesses generally in the Government's wider reopening plan has been damaged. IBEC is concerned that this could materially impact Ireland's wider economic recovery. Ireland faces some unique challenges in the post-Covid era. We have obvious long-standing infrastructural deficits, significant Government policy commitments in areas like health, pensions and the labour market and hugely ambitious climate targets to meet. We are also facing threats to our business model from global corporate tax change. All of these will have challenging implications for economic growth, business competitiveness and tax revenues in the months and years ahead. Engage with firms Extended closures to sectors of the economy will undermine our capacity as a country to tackle these challenges head on. Much greater certainty and information are needed for all businesses on the Government's modelling data, timelines and milestones for the revised vaccine rollout, the use of antigen testing, and the GDPR issues for employers generally on requesting and holding information in relation to vaccination status. The events of last week clearly illustrate that a more effective stakeholder engagement model is badly required. The broader business community implores Taoiseach Micheal Martin and his Ministers to improve their communications to business. Business wants to work collaboratively with Government on the ongoing challenges posed by Covid, but this requires a comprehensive approach to engagement on key decisions.

Speaking to The Irish Times, Martin Shanahan also said he expects physical site visits by multinational companies considering investments in the Republic to resume shortly. These came to a sudden halt as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with all but a handful of the 142 investments secured in the first half of this year having resulted from virtual visits. Mr Shanahan said while the State's 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate was an important factor in attracting FDI, it is just one factor. ""What we've seen, particularly in the last two or three years, is that investors are focused on consistency and stability. [What] they want to know in the context of the pandemic is that the locations in which they invest can deliver for them, and Ireland obviously has a great track record in terms of this,"" he said ahead of the publication of mid-year figures and IDA Ireland's annual report. His comments come after G20 finance ministers at the weekend endorsed a global minimum 15 per cent corporation tax rate to which Ireland has yet to sign up to.  'Perfectly legitimate' Mr Shanahan said it was ""perfectly legitimate"" for the State to make its case in negotiations on retaining the 12.5 per cent rate given its impact on investment levels here and the need for smaller peripheral nations to be able to compete effectively with larger ones.  He added there was no evidence of client companies holding off investments, with a possible deal far from agreed at this point. Mr Shanahan said that rather than tax the number one discussion with client companies at present continues to centre on availability of talent.  He said while decisions such as that recently taken by Facebook to allow some employees in its Irish offices to work from abroad is evidence that ""things will never be the same as they were,"" he also does not expect this to impact on investment decisions.  ""What we are hearing is that companies are anxious to get their employees back to offices when it is safe to do so for reasons such as collaboration and innovation. Also, remote working and the flexibility it offers presents opportunities, particularly for the regions where FDI investments might not have been as likely before.""  Overall investments New figures published by IDA Ireland  yesterday show FDI inflows rebounded in the first six months to near pre-pandemic levels.  Overall investments were up 8 per cent versus the 132 confirmed in the same period in 2020. More than 62 investments were made by new clients. while almost half were secured for regional locations. The State agency said the associated employment potential from new FDI wins is over 12,530 jobs, compared to 9,600 in the first half of last year. In 2020 some 246 new investments were made with 20,123 jobs created. Of these some 95 investments were from new investors. Mr Shanahan said that while recovery in global FDI flows is under way after a sharp decline last year, a return to pre-pandemic levels is not expected until 2022.  He added that competition for investment is also expected to intensify. IDA Ireland's new strategy, which was announced in January, sees it targeting 800 investments in total between 2021 and 2024 with the aim of ensuring that half of these are for regions outside of the capital.  It is also seeking the creation of 50,000 jobs over the four-year period."

Speaking against a backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, Mr Macron announced that vaccination will be mandatory for medical personnel in contact with the elderly and other at-risk populations. There will be checks from September 15th and those who do not comply will penalised. Only 40 per cent of employees in nursing homes are now vaccinated. A Covid pass with a QR code indicating its holder is fully vaccinated, has tested negative for Covid or has gained immunity through illness, will be required for access to concerts and other places of entertainment from July 21st. Passes will be mandatory for cafes, restaurants, shopping centres, hospitals and trains from August 1st. Mr Macron began on an upbeat note, thanking healthcare workers for their dedication and the French for their civic sense. ""We succeeded in mastering the epidemic and came back to life,"" he said. The infection rate had dipped below 2,000 new cases daily, ""compared to more than 35,000 at the worst of the crisis"". Positive light Mr Macron presented the bad news in a positive light, compatible with his presidential re-election campaign. He did not mention that 4,256 new Covid cases were reported in France on Sunday. He said his policy of ""whatever it costs"" has created ""a vigorous rebound"" and he expects the French economy to grow 6 per cent in 2021, ""in the lead for big European economies"".  France attracted the most foreign direct investment of any country in Europe for the last two years. Contrary to predictions, he added, employment has not been severely affected. Then came the bad news: ""Our country is confronted with a strong resumption of the epidemic . . . The arrival of the so-called Delta variant has led to an increase in infections throughout the world, because this variant is three times more contagious than the original virus. It rushes into every space that is not covered by vaccination,"" Mr Macron said. ""The equation is simple,"" he continued. ""The more we vaccinate, the less space we leave to the virus to spread, the more we avoid hospitalisations and other mutations."" He declared 2021 to be ""a summer of mobilisation for vaccination"". Though vaccination has been made mandatory only for healthcare workers at the moment, Mr Macron said that France ""must move towards vaccinating everyone, because that is the only path to a return to normal life"". He predicted that the question of ""mandatory vaccination for all French people"" will arise. Laboratories will charge for PCR tests, which have been free, from this autumn, ""to encourage vaccination rather than multiple tests""."

Ireland's independence from the UK was - and still is - of huge importance to Irish people. However, life was a huge struggle for most people in the early years of independence - and the bitter Irish Civil War which followed the truce proved a tumultuous time. While there are plenty of financial and other challenges facing Irish people today, they likely pale in comparison to those faced by many of our counterparts in the 1920s. Many of the things we take for granted today were out of reach of most of our predecessors living back then. So how do our lives today compare to those living one hundred years ago?NO RUNNING WATER OR ELECTRICITY ""Life was very much a struggle when the State was founded,"" said Frank Barry, professor of international business and economic development with Trinity Business School. ""Ireland was a very poor country in the 1920s - it was about as poor back then as Pakistan or Venezuela is today."" In Dublin, many working class families lived in appalling housing conditions. ""About a quarter of Dublin families were living in one-room tenements, where there was no electricity and only a tap in the back yard [for water],"" said Barry. ""People often died of the cold in these tenements. Vast numbers of children died in the first year after they were born."" Ireland was a predominently agricultural country in the 1920s. ""Agricultural countries were poorer than industrial countries,"" said Barry. ""Many people lived on the family farm and had no electricity and no running water."" Many of these farms were tiny farms of around 30 acres or less. ""The average farm today is 80 acres,"" said Barry. FOOD WAS OFTEN A STRUGGLE The main financial challenge facing many Irish people in the 1920s was to put food on the table. In the 1920s, about 60pc of people's expenditure was on food - and that proportion of food expenditure is very much in line with that of a developing country, according to Barry. Today, about 15pc of household expenditure goes on food, according to the latest official figures. ""People had enough to eat and that was it,"" said John Fitzgerald, research affiliate with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and adjunct professor with Trinity College Dublin (TCD). In addition to the Great Famine of 1845 to the early 1850s, there was a period of near famine in Ireland in the early 1920s. The west of Ireland was one of the regions worst hit by this near famine - with a shortage of potatoes forcing many families along the coast to survive on seaweed and shellfish. There are reports of people who starved to death - or who died from starvation-related disease - at this time. LONGER WORKING WEEK People in employment typically worked much longer hours in the 1920s than workers do today. ""People worked at least a full day extra a week [than we do today],"" said Barry. ""The average hours of industrial work today is 39 hours a week. Until the 1930s, there was a 48-hour working week - at least.""NO FOREIGN HOLIDAYS AND FEW CARS Cars and foreign holidays were very much the preserve of the wealthy in the 1920s. ""Motor cars were very infrequent at the time,"" said Barry. ""There were about 10,000 cars in Ireland in the 1920s - compared to two million today. Rich families and doctors would have had cars. Most people travelled by horse and cart - and train."" For many ordinary Irish workers, Christmas was their only time off during the year, according to Barry. ""The middle class and the wealthy would have afforded holidays back then,"" said Barry. ""The rich could afford to go off on grand tours of Europe. The only evidence I've come across of [ordinary] people taking holidays in the 1920s was when their employer organised day trips by trains."" WEALTH INEQUALITY Irish society was ""very stratified"" in the 1920s, according to Barry. ""You had very wealthy people living in luxury and then you had the poor,"" said Barry. ""Income distribution was more inequitable than it is today."" Most of the wealthy people in Ireland at the time were business owners and former landowners. ""You also had a relatively small middle class - like doctors, accountants and stockbrokers,"" said Barry. SCHOOL AND COLLEGE Although attendance at primary school was made compulsory in Ireland in the early 1920s, many children did not go to school - and children often left school early. ""Often in agricultural families, the kids took off to work on the family farm whenever they were required,"" said Barry. Most children didn't go to secondary school. ""Most children - bar those of professionals - left school at the age of 12 or 13,"" said Barry. ""That continued for some time. In the 1960s, half of school children were still leaving school at the age of 13."" Free second-level education was introduced in Ireland in 1967 - and this investment in education was very positive for society. ""In the 1920s and 1930s, we had miserable investment in education,"" said Fitzgerald. College was very much the preserve of the wealthy. ""The number of college-goers only started to pick up in the 1960s,"" said Barry. SOCIAL WELFARE CUTS An Old Age Pension (OAP) was introduced in Ireland in 1908 - when Ireland was still under British rule. ""This OAP was cut in the early days of Irish independence as the [Irish] government couldn't afford it,"" said Eoin McLaughlin, senior economics lecturer in University College Cork. One of the first things the Irish Government did after independence was to get rid of workhouses. Workhouses were introduced in Ireland in the mid-19th century as a way to provide relief for the poor - but they were harsh and often cruel environments to live in. Whole families had to enter the workhouses together and they were then sepa- rated from other family members - apart from very young children being allowed to stay with their mothers. ""Workhouses were almost a punishment for social welfare,"" said McLaughlin. MASSIVE EMIGRATION Unemployment was a big problem in Ireland in the 1920s - and many emigrated in search of work and a better life. ""You had massive emigration until the 1960s,"" said Fitzgerald. ""People just got out - people wanted a standard of living."" Migration - where Irish people worked abroad for a few months a year - was also common. ""In Donegal [and other parts of the west], people often travelled to Scotland to pick potatoes,"" said Barry. ""Ireland was very much the Eastern Europe of the time - providing this seasonal type of labour."" Moving up the social classes was relatively unheard of back in the 1920s - unless you were the child or grandchild of an Irish emigrant. ""Rags to riches stories were rare unless you went to America and made your fortune in America - and even then, it tended to be the second-generation emigrants [that prospered],"" said McLaughlin. A WORLD APART ""Irish people are about 10 times better off on average now than they were in the 1920s - when you look at the aggregate national income per head - and the purchasing power that people had,"" said Barry. Wage rates have also risen substantially in Ireland over the last 100 years - though the cost of living here is also very high today. ""Wage rates in manufacturing in Ireland would have been 50pc to 60pc of theUK in the 1920s and it remained at that level until the early 1960s,"" said Fitzgerald. ""Wage rates rose between the early 1960s and mid- 1970s to be equal to the UK. Wage rates here would now typically be higher than the UK."" Many believe that it was Ireland's entry into the EU in 1973 - rather than its independence from Britain - which boosted its prosperity and the lives of its citizens. ""Between the 1920s and 1960s, Ireland's economic performance was slow,"" said Barry. ""Joining the EU in 1973 made a major change for Irish rural life."" Foreign direct investment in Ireland - which increased from the 1950s - was a big driver of economic growth in Ireland's cities, according to Barry. A general improvement in living standards around the world over the last 100 years also helped improve the day-to-day lives of Irish people. ""Ireland rose alongside other countries,"" said Barry. ""The improvement in educational attainment has helped too - that took off in the 1960s."" Another big difference between today and the 1920s is life expectancy. The average life expectancy in the 1920s was between the mid- 50s and 60. ""Today, it's in the early 80s,"" said Barry. There will be some who argue that life was much simpler and happier in the 1920s than it is today. However it is clear that Ireland has come a long way since.

The Government is one of eight nations still holding out on a deal struck last week by 131 other countries at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Finance ministers from the world's 20 richest nations meeting in Venice yesterday were set to endorse the deal, but want Ireland, Hungary, Estonia and other holdouts to get on board. ""We invite all members that have not yet joined the international agreement to do so,"" said a draft communique from the meeting, seen by Reuters. Ireland ""fully"" supports the first part of the deal, which would force the world's top 100 corporations to pay a portion of tax where they make their sales. But the Government has ""reservations"" about a 15pc global minimum tax rate, which would see large multinationals paying top-up taxes at home if they pay below the minimum rate in countries such as Ireland. The OECD has yet to work out the finer details of the deal, such as how to treat credits, depreciation or deferred taxes, which will be crucial to companies' investment decisions. Other variables include the US's domestic tax overhaul, which sets a minimum corporate tax rate of 21pc, and the EU's upcoming digital levy, which threatens to rile the US. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will travel to Brussels on Monday to meet with eurozone finance ministers, including Ireland's Paschal Donohoe. However, a senior EU official said a ""discussion on taxes will be discouraged"". ""We will try to avoid the issue,"" the official said.

Two sources said the statement was expected to be released without changes at their meeting in the Italian city of Venice due to be wrapped up today. ""We call on [countries involved in the global talks] to swiftly address the remaining issues and finalise the design elements within the agreed framework together with a detailed plan for the implementation of the two pillars by our next meeting in October,"" the statement said. ""We invite all members [involved in the discussion] that have not yet joined the international agreement to do so."" The statement, if approved, represents political endorsement of an agreement this month among 131 countries, at talks hosted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), on taxation of multinationals' profits and setting a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent. The aim is to have G20 leaders give it final blessing at an October summit in Rome.  New tax rules If all goes to plan, the new tax rules should be translated into binding legislation worldwide before the end of 2023. However, a fight in the US Congress over President Joe Biden's proposed tax increases on corporations and wealthy Americans could yet create hurdles. Equally, there could be difficulties because EU member states Ireland, Estonia and Hungary are among the countries that have not yet signed up to the deal. Ireland's corporate tax rate is 12.5 per cent and on July 1st, it was one of only nine of 139 countries in the ""inclusive framework"" at the OECD to reject a draft agreement on international corporate tax reform.

That is Jadon have been by far the best in the lead-in. It was a gamble (to bring them on), but if we gamble earlier we maybe lose the game in extra time.' Southgate felt his side's lack of composure on the ball was their major problem in the second half, when Italy came back into the match. 'We did start well,' said Southgate. 'Our system worked really well against theirs. They were bound to have a spell where they came into the game. 'We didn't keep the ball well enough in that initial period in the second half. It was our lack of composure in possession that turned the game. 'It's hard to reflect, as the disappointment is enormous for all of us. This group of players have done us proud and the nation has got behind them. Tonight's going to burst the balloon but I hope everyone remembers what this group has given them. 'We've given everybody some fantastic nights. We wanted to do one more and we were so close to doing that. It's hard to put it into words.' Captain Harry Kane insisted that his team-mates had nothing left to offer after a gruelling 120 minutes. 'The boys couldn't give more. Penalties are the worst feeling in the world when you lose,' he said. 'It was a fantastic tournament. We should be proud, but of course it's going to hurt for a while. We're on the right track, we're building, and hopefully we can progress from here. 'We were up against a very good side. Obviously we got off to the perfect start. Maybe we dropped a little bit deep. Sometimes when you score early it's easy to try to soak up pressure and hold on to that, and that's what happened. 'They had a lot of the ball, a lot of possession. But to be fair we looked fairly in control, they didn't create too many chances. They got the goal from a set-piece and after that it's probably 50-50. '(In the penalties) we went through our processes, the boys did everything they could. It just wasn't our night.' Maguire absolved anyone of blame, adding: 'We don't put any blame on anyone. We worked tirelessly in training. They have one of the best keepers in the world and he's the player of the tournament which he probably deserves. The pressure is as big as you feel. 'We keep improving and that is what we need to do. We got to the semi-final in Russia, we got to the final here. We felt we had enough tools to win.'

By the time the League was wound up in March as Covid-19 struck, Leitrim had just scored an eight-point win over Louth. But a Covid outbreak saw them forfeit their tie against Down and while they could still have saved themselves by beating Tipperary in their last game, they lost by two points to the eventual Munster champions. A week later, they were competitive against Mayo for the majority of their Connacht quarter-final but eventually lost 2-15 to 0-10. On Sunday, that margin increased to 24 points as Mayo routed them in Castlebar. Having finally found some momentum under Terry Hyland, it's long gone now. Though the pandemic clearly hasn't done anyone any favours, it's probably the single-biggest reason for that. Leitrim would have entertained thoughts of another promotion from Division Four this year but, a first half red card, brought on a defeat by Sligo. Mickey Harte's Louth beat them next and all they had to look forward to was a knockout Championship tie, away to last year's All-Ireland finalists, seven weeks in the distance. Player turnover is part of the natural evolution of any team but while it's been endemic in Leitrim, Hyland has certainly brought more stability across the board with 10 players starting against Mayo both this year and last. play at Yet, just four, have started all of their three Connacht Championship games under the Cavan man. As Hyland alluded to, whatever hope Leitrim have entering fixtures like Sunday's, they have no chance of even being competitive from a standing start. ""Anybody from Division Three or Four, are they better off playing against their own teams and improving on the back of that and building a bit of confidence?"" he wondered. Striking that balance between competitive games, without completely cordoning counties off and perpetuating gaps that already exist, is key. Whether the proposals coming before Special Congress later this year are fit to achieve that is debatable.

Or rather to bet its political future on housing. The new strategy plan for this most thorny of problems, to be published later this month, is not going to hold back.  There will be big money and big targets as the Government parties try to address this area of maximum political exposure, one where Sinn Féin has been making much of the running.  The plan is being drawn up by Minister for Housing Daragh O'Brien, but it is clear that the Department of the Taoiseach is having a major input. And in turn, Micheál Martin's support - and his view of the vital position of housing in the Coalition's future - is driving a lot of this.  While the finishing touches have still to be put to the strategy, the target numbers will be big - across the board. Very significant additional State resources will be committed.  This is all driven by the clear view in Government that housing is the vital political issue, and the key reason why Sinn Féin have been gaining in the polls. The loss of the Fine Gael seat in the Dublin byelection - and the poor result for Fianna Fáil - will only add to the political impetus. Normally incumbency in office gives an advantage as government can ""do"" things. But in housing - given the long lead-time and the complexity of the issue - this can be a problem too. Sinn Féin and the other Opposition parties can claim they would do a better job and would get things done more quickly. Whether anyone could in fact quickly increase housing supply to 35,000-plus is debatable given the problems in areas like planning and industry capacity and the troublesome economics of the sector. But this is the Government's big attempt to try. We will have to see how this fits alongside another document to be published shortly, the Summer Economic Statement from the Department of Finance. This will set a target for the budget deficit for next year and beyond, designed to be a brake to ensure that the public finances do not spin out of control.  Choose to allocate more to housing and less is left for other areas. Or taxes can rise, but as Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is talking about cuts in the tax burden, then that won't be popular either.  Meanwhile, significant extra spending in areas like climate change is also likely in a revised National Development Plan. To say it is not clear how this can all sit with a falling budget deficit is to state the obvious.  'Cashing in'  There are real tensions in Government about this, not only between parties but - it seems - within them. Fine Gael's Paschal Donohoe and Fianna Fáil's Michael McGrath, the two budget Ministers, will argue for prudence.  The rest of the Cabinet will want the housing plan and more cash for their own departments. If the ESRI says it is okay to borrow for housing, the argument will go, why not borrow for other stuff too ? Housing must , of course, be a priority. But it won't - can't - be fixed quickly. A fundamental goal of any plan must be to get behind why housing supply was so slow to respond as economic growth boomed before Covid.  If these problems are not addressed, then billions may be spent without getting the required result.  A key issue is the cost of building, particularly of apartments. Economist Ronan Lyons has argued for some years that it is vital to discover exactly why costs are so high here.  People talk about developers and builders "" cashing in"" - and I'm sure some do. But the real mystery of the housing market in recent years was why a lot more houses were not built. If there was ""cashing in"" to be done, in other words, the industry was making a bad job of it. It seems a particular focus of the plan will be getting more apartments built. The industry has complained that it is not economic to do so now at a reasonable cost - requiring developments to be pre-sold to funds and then rented out at very high cost. It looks like some more State subsidies or tax breaks are coming down the line here to close the affordability gap.  We saw, during the boom years, how badly designed subsidies and tax breaks can lead to unintended consequences. Danger here, as George Hamilton would say.  Throwing paint  It makes sense to have a housing strategy and to make this a national priority, in the way dealing with Covid-19 was. The danger is that political pressure turns it into an exercise in throwing paint at a wall and hoping enough of it will stick.  That turns it into an exercise in adding yet more schemes and incentives to the bewildering mixture which is now evident in the market, some helping, some distorting, some working against other ones. Just look at the row this week over tax breaks for institutional landlords renting to local authority tenants. It would make much more sense to use much of the money spent on these schemes to build local authority accommodation. But right now families on local authority lists need a place to stay - and so the cycle continues. Putting in place fixes which will take a few years to work are not a strength of our political system. The problems in getting building ""done"" need to be sorted - the cost, the planning delays, the incentives for land use, the conflicting schemes and incentives, and the lack of capacity in the sector. If the new plan makes a genuine attempt to address these key constraints then it could lead to progress. If not, if it is another mix of new schemes, incentives and tax breaks, it will be just another housing plan which is doomed to fail. "

The statement was due to have been approved by the Cabinet yesterday but was not brought forward by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe because he has not yet reached agreement on its contents with Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Green leader Eamon Ryan and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath. It is understood that talks between officials were continuing last night in a bid to reach agreement in time to present the statement to a second Cabinet meeting either today or tomorrow morning. Senior officials insisted that it will be published this week. However, there is understood to be significant division, with Fianna Fáil pressing for a substantial increase in capital funding for housing which will be included in the Government's new housing plan next week, while Mr Donohoe wants to enshrine a commitment to deficit reduction in the document.  It is understood that there was a brief discussion on the issue at the conclusion of yesterday's Cabinet meeting in which Mr Donohoe expressed his concern about the fiscal credibility of the Government if it could not resolve the issue and produce a robust economic statement. Sources said that the Taoiseach intervened and said he agreed with Mr Donohoe but that the Government had to sort out the housing issue.  'Housing for All' It is expected that the ""Housing for All"" plan, a new housing strategy to be published by Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien next week, will see a big increase in the amount of public money committed to build public housing. But there are growing concerns in the Department of Finance about the level of spending commitments in Government, and Mr Donohoe has pointed on a number of occasions in recent weeks to the need to reduce the deficit and control borrowing. The row goes to the heart of one of the biggest issues facing the Government - the adjustment in public spending from pandemic levels to more normal post-pandemic levels. Mr Donohoe is known to be keen to set a budgetary framework for the coming years that would see a gradual reduction in the budget deficit and the level of borrowing reduced. While there is general agreement in Government on this goal, there are significant divisions about the pace of the adjustment.  Mr Donohoe is said by colleagues to be determined that the State will not be running a large current deficit in 2023, meaning that adjustments will have to begin next year, and be included in next October's budget.

Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said in a statement yesterday that Ryanair had agreed to operate the service on a commercial basis, at no cost to the Exchequer, from July 19. But Ryanair immediately issued a statement insisting that while it had offered to operate the service without any subsidies, no agreement had been concluded. It said the Department's announcement was ""premature and inaccurate"". The carrier, headed by Michael O'Leary, claimed it had not been consulted about the Department's announcement. The Dublin-Kerry route was operated as a public service obligation (PSO) route that was heavily subsidised with taxpayer money. That contract was held by Stobart Air, which collapsed in June. Stobart Air, which operated the Aer Lingus Regional service, also flew the Dublin-Donegal PSO route. Following the statement by Ryanair, the Department rounded on the carrier. It said that Ryanair wrote to it on June 28 indicating it was making a formal application to operate a double-daily service between Dublin and Kerry for the next seven months and thereafter, without any public funding. The Department issued a full response to Ryanair on July 6, with Mr Ryan asking the carrier for a written commitment to meeting a number of requirements. The Department said Ryanair responded on July 8, confirming that it would operate the service twice daily on a commercial basis from July 19. Ryanair asked the Department to accept its offer before the close of business yesterday so the airline could start marketing the flights. In the letter on Thursday to the Department, Ryanair DAC chief executive Eddie Wilson said its move to operate the service commercially would save the taxpayer (EURO)3.9m a year. He wanted no price cap on the ticket prices, but said: ""We are happy to confirm that at least 90 seats each way will not exceed (EURO)80."" Yesterday, the Department said it engaged with the Ryanair boss just before lunchtime to advise him that a letter would be issued from the minister confirming the airline's acceptance to operate the Kerry service and that an announcement would be made in the afternoon. The Department said that while Ryanair wanted to wait until Monday to make the announcement, the minister wanted to make it yesterday. ""The Department agreed to share the press statement with Ryanair, which it did,"" said the Department. Mr Ryan said in his statement that Ryanair has offered to meet the PSO requirement on the Dublin-Kerry route, ensuring fixed standards of ""continuity, regularity and pricing"". ""I believe this is a really good outcome for the Kerry region, providing a higher capacity air service for passengers as the summer season unfolds, and supporting the local economy as it begins its recovery from Covid,"" he added. The Department of Transport hopes that the Dublin-Donegal PSO service will also relaunch the same week, with a preferred bidder having been selected.

With big government back in fashion, the State badly needs a formal plan to address the hollowing out of city and town centres. The latest big name to make for the exit and go online is US apparel giant Gap, which last week announced the phased closure over August and September of all 81 of its stores in Ireland and the UK. It operates here from three locations in Dublin, as well as Cork and Limerick. Gap's five Irish stores are mostly in shopping centres and retail parks, and not on main thoroughfares, but the fact that its departure could pass almost without commentary is indicative of how inured the sector has become to big name exits. Debenhams, Monsoon, Oasis, Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Warehouse are just some of the other retailers that have left the scene recently. The drift from bricks and mortar to online shopping began in earnest about three years ago. But prior to the virus the impact on the streets was often softened by the fact that each time a shop closed, there was a queue of hospitality operators to take the retailer's place. The pandemic has shut off that safety valve for town centres as the hospitality sector has been hardest hit by restrictions. Now whenever a shop closes it may stay empty for a long time. Dublin's north inner city, in particular, is burdened with dire vacancy rates. It was estimated by Dublin Town, a local traders group, that up to 30 per cent of the stores on Henry Street were vacant when the non-essential retail sector reopened in May. The southern end of Grafton Street, meanwhile, has been scarred with vacant shops for more than 18 months. The wider issue is interlinked with virus restrictions, the drift to online shopping, a lack of tourism and the trend towards working from home. It is too complex and too widespread to be left to local authorities to address, which has been the case until now. The Government needs to step in and take control by devising a central policy framework to pull urban retail zones out of this vortex."

The economic recovery is being held hostage by the Greek alphabet - specifically Delta, though there may be an Epsilon and more to come. And it is clear after 130 countries signed up to a corporate tax reform plan that Ireland's economic model of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) here is under pressure, presenting a diplomatic path of the greatest delicacy for Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe to walk. And so we see dangers to the twin engines of the Irish economy. The lingering epidemic threatens consumer-facing domestic businesses, reshaping key sectors which employ tens of thousands of people. Standing back from the rows about how this was all decided and communicated, the message is clear - we are not out of the woods yet. The corporate tax changes pose questions about the thriving multinational sector and whether future investment might be lost, as well as vital tax revenues. This week Ireland decided to join just nine other countries in refusing, for now anyway, to sign up to the new landmark deal. Given the massive US push for a deal, this was a big political call. Forecasting, in these circumstances, and setting out plans in areas such as the public finances is really difficult. The challenge for the Government is to try to be strategic - and not just reactive.  Any longer-term thinking as the pandemic rolls on is really difficult. A few weeks ago, the Department of Finance published some research, based in particular on what had happened in Israel, suggesting that a critical point was reached when about 40 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated.  But as the virus rampages through the UK, it is clear that much higher coverage levels will be needed to suppress the more infectious Delta variant. The unanswered question is whether, with most of the vulnerable population jabbed, countries like the UK and Israel will now see big rises in hospitalisation and deaths. You would suspect indoor dining will not reopen here on July 19th. And Delta has raised new questions, too, about both the pace of recovery in the next few months and the longer-term prospects of economic life after Covid-19. The reopening of schools and college campuses requires urgent thought and planning - and examination of tools such as quick testing. Widespread rapid testing in Germany, for example, seems to be having a positive impact.  Damage  The Government's job is to underpin stability as best it can - and to do all it can to get sectors open safely in the weeks ahead. The speeding up of vaccination - now in the ""come and get it"" phase for all - is welcome and vital. But we may now need to plan for a longer interim phase - when vaccination provides rising protection but not enough to remove all restrictions - and this will require serious preparation to try to keep as much of the economy and society open as possible while also keeping people safe. The longer the pandemic goes on, the greater the damage to key sectors of the economy - hospitality, retail, leisure, tourism - and the more questions are raised about how consumers will act in future. Online shopping may become permanent, travel will be slow to recover and so on. Fortunately, the signs are that consumers are adjusting and the revival has been strong. But everyone is now again asking whether it will ever be ""over"" and that affects behaviour and spending.  Fortunately, tax returns yesterday show that income tax returns are ahead of expectations. The incomes - and savings - are there to boost spending. And corporate taxes, which have paid for so much in recent years, are again ahead of target, even if some threat now lies ahead. The big multinationals are paying more and more tax here, ironically in part due to the first phase of OECD reforms. But the second phase, now under discussion, brings dangers.  Paschal Donohoe will be aware of the reputation risks to Ireland from holding on from signing a deal along with eight other smaller players. Ireland - or Estonia and Hungary, the other two European Union hold-outs - cannot block an OECD deal. However, everyone will be conscious that one country can probably veto EU implementation of the OECD deal, even if bigger EU countries threaten to find a way around this.  The key issue for Ireland - and why the State has not signed up - is the uncertainty about what happens in the United States, the key source of FDI here. With significant debate in Congress, will the US be able to agree its own minimum rate for the international earnings of its companies - and if so will it be at the same level as the effective tax rate agreed by the OECD?  Holding fire  This is the key reason Paschal Donohoe is holding fire for now - despite the reputational dangers of being outside the tent. It points to a vital period of diplomacy with the US, as Ireland is pushed to sign up, but the Government first looks for clarity about what the US will do. With or without a deal, massive changes in global corporate tax are now on the way. In the absence of agreement, countries will move unilaterally. Like Covid-19, this presents the Government with challenges of preparation, albeit longer-term ones. How are we going to fund third-level education and further research? What are the key infrastructural issues we need to address to keep investment coming here - affordable housing being clearly one?  It is hard to see through the fog here, but difficult to escape the conclusion that we are at an economic turning point.

The ZELP - or Zero Emissions Livestock Production methane-reduction device - is designed to be worn by cows and is one of a plethora of scientific initiatives aimed at reducing environmental damage from the dairy industry. The ZELP is just one possible version of the complicated future for a sector that finds itself at a crossroads. The dairy sector has been the bright star of Irish agriculture for close to a decade. The lifting of milk quotas six years ago allowed it undergo massive and rapid expansion. The total number of cows in the Irish dairy herd has risen from 1.14 million in 2010 to 1.57 million last year, a 37pc increase. Ireland's 17,000 dairy farms help sustain 60,000 jobs, with output valued at (EURO)11.3bn and (EURO)5.2bn of exports to 120 countries in 2020. Irish dairy farms have the best net profit margins and lowest production costs in Europe, creating a huge success story from Irish cheese to whey and baby formula. But this success has come at a cost. ""Dairying is the only profitable part of Irish agriculture, but it is profitable at the expense of environmental damage and quite a significant sacrifice of our water quality,"" says Maynooth University climate change scientist, Professor John Sweeney. ""There is an element of passing on the pollution costs of the industry to the environment and thus to the general public."" Greenhouse gases emitted from the dairy herd are among Ireland's single biggest drivers of climate change and the Environmental Protection Agency has raised concerns about rising levels of nitrogen in Irish rivers. But proposed legislation to drastically reduce these emissions threatens to choke the industry and turn expansion into decline. An Taisce's unsuccessful objection to a huge Glanbia cheese plant in Kilkenny was a sign of the hard slog to come. Last week one global investor group issued a report declaring: ""Cows are the new coal"". ""The emissions from agriculture and related land use are on a level with the greenhouse gases emitted by the EU, US and Japan combined,"" said the FAIRR Initiative, a coalition of big name investment houses pushing for cleaner agriculture. Change is on the way. ""The intensification model is bust,"" says Sweeney. ""We have to look at an alternative form of agriculture, not based on high inputs and outputs, but based on low inputs and higher value output. There's no alternative to a herd reduction in the short term. We can't run away from that."" The government is progressing legislation for a 51pc reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a carbon neutral economy by 2050. Each sector will have a percentage reduction it must hit in that timeframe. ""Irish agriculture has to face the fact that society now demands it pay its fair share in terms of substantial reductions,"" says Sweeney. ""If agriculture succeeds in getting a small emissions reduction over the 2030 period, then the burden falls more heavily on others in society to make up the difference."" And quite how the curtailment of Irish dairy fits with the government's ambition to grow agri-food exports from (EURO)13bn last year to (EURO)21bn by 2030 remains to be seen. ""Farmers accept the data and science - of course we do,"" says Pat Mc- Cormack, president of Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). ""We know we're going to have to transition our multi-billion euro farming and agri-food sector to a low emissions basis and that's going to involve research, regulation, commitment and investment. We're fully cognisant of the challenge and prepared to get behind this transition on which the future economic, social and demographic stability of rural Ireland will depend. ""But what we're absolutely not prepared to do is go along with this fantasy that the only people that will have to change their ways are the farmers and that everything else in the food-supply chain carries on as normal. ""Everybody - and I specifically mean the consumer here - had better realise that this transition is going to mean the ending of the 'Cheap Food' policy introduced by the EEC and maintained by the EU which gave ultimate control over consumer food prices to the retail corporations. This will not be popular or easy to implement."" According to McCormack, the big retailers systematically wiped out farmers' margins to drive down the price at which they sold food. ""The politicians let them do that because the consumers liked cheap food. As their margins disappeared the farmers had two choices: either get out of farming completely or scale-up and try and make up on volumes what they had lost on margins. It suited the consumers, it suited the corporate retailers, and it suited the politicians and policymakers. It didn't suit the farmers because they now had to work harder than ever and borrow more than ever to get up their volumes to achieve a comparable income. And it certainly hasn't suited the environment, because the volumes demanded by the corporate retailers to enable them to sell food at artificially low prices are environmentally stressing."" While many in the sector still hope that science can provide a silver bullet solution that will protect it against the worst doomsday scenarios there is no doubt a major challenge lies ahead. A recent Teagasc report contains a stark warning: ""Current scientific understanding indicates that reducing Irish agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through technical means is challenging, particularly so for biogenic methane produced by pasture-based ruminants. However, this is now a major area of scientific research in Teagasc and elsewhere, which should yield positive results in the coming years"" But in the short term major reductions, equivalent to the 51pc required nationally by 2030 ""would require a substantial reduction in the amount of agricultural activity in Ireland. There is no prospect in the current decade of scientific solutions alone being capable of delivering agricultural GHG emission reductions of this magnitude."" UCD Professor Kevin O'Connor leads the Farm Zero C project, one of the more promising Irish-based scientific efforts in this regard. He heads up a Science Foundation Ireland backed research centre called Biorbic, which alongside dairy producer Carbery, as well as Teagasc, is working to create a climate-neutral commercial dairy farm in Cork. It plans to extend the strategy to a further 5,000 farms within five years. ""We are looking at the entire package of biodiversity, water quality, air quality, soil health and renewable energy because they are all interlinked,"" he says. ""Maybe it's five years away before this is widespread on dairy farms. We need to demonstrate it first on a farm and show that it works."" But O'Connor says that science is just part of the answer. ""There seems to be a presumption that farmers will just adapt. Farms are businesses so it has to pay for them to adapt. If European citizens and politicians want a sustainable way of living then they need to create payment schemes that ensure farmers are going to do the right thing, informed by science and best practice."" They should be paid for ecosystem services like planting native woodlands, wider hedgerows and turning less productive land over to carbon sequestration and biodiversity projects, he says. Others within the farm sector agree that this type of change is coming, but warn it will be painful and could split the farming community. Dairy farmers will argue that priority for Ireland's shrinking agricultural emissions budget should be given to the profitable dairy sector ahead of other types of agriculture. The real debate could be less about rural-versus-urban or farmers-versus-Government and more about dairy-versus-suckler or dairy-versus-beef, said one industry source. ""This is where the debate could become extremely political and could lead to a situation where Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael TDs from, say, Cork will be clashing with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs from Connacht on the question of what farming sectors will be bearing the heaviest burden of agri-emissions reductions. The western TDs will see the championing of dairy as a threat to the type of farming that is most prevalent in their localities, while the Cork TDs will openly question the logic of using increasingly valuable emissions capacity to support breakeven beef production for part-time farmers in Connacht when it could have been utilised for Cork's massive dairy sector."" The jostling has already started and the different farm sectors are already sizing each other up for the coming row, says the source. ""It's no longer possible - if it ever was - to continue with the old fantasy that a Connemara sheep farmer, a Carlow tillage farmer, a Monaghan pig farmer, a Meath beef operation and a Tipperary dairy farmer all have the same interests. The fault-lines are there to see and widening. It's now obvious that it's dairy versus the rest and that spells serious trouble.""

For much of the last two years, it has felt like more of the same, as concerns grew that lessons hadn't been learned from past failures. There is no point scoring 10 tries, throwing 16 offloads, making 29 clean breaks, beating 31 defenders and adopting an expansive mindset against a hapless USA side unless the coaches intend to strike a better balance with Ireland's style of www.play.No one is going overboard about the facile nature of the 71-10 victory, yet there were plenty of green shoots that if nurtured correctly can make Ireland a more dangerous and, perhaps most importantly, a smarter team going forward. USA didn't offer much of a challenge and while their porous defence was asking to be exploited, Ireland did so in a manner that was as thrilling as it was effective. That it was a young team with eight new caps inflicting the damage gave even more cause for optimism, but not if the old guard all return in November and Ireland revert to type. This is a huge opportunity to turn a corner and build on a successful summer in which Andy Farrell has learned a lot about the next generation of talent flooding through. Some of those players who were in the wider squad over the last few weeks will likely have to wait for another call-up, but many of the young guns have shown they are now primed to play a bigger role and push the perceived front-liners. Certain positions, such as the backrow, are far more stocked than say loosehead, but that's the challenge for Farrell until the 2023 World Cup. The lineout still needs work because for all that Rónan Kelleher delivered another outstanding performance in the loose, set-piece issues were evident again. As ever, it wasn't all down to the hooker, and to his and James Ryan's credit, the Leinster duo solved the issues to such devastating effect that the USA were powerless to stop the Ireland maul once it got going. Tom O'Toole's debut couldn't have gone much better. Yes, he wasn't properly tested at scrum-time, the one area where the young tighthead is still learning the ropes, but the Ulster prop's comfort on the ball was indicative of a man relishing the step up. Flying winger Robert Baloucoune, clever centre James Hume and the all-action Gavin Coombes looked equally at home in the back-row and having enjoyed his first Test start, one senses that another big season lies ahead for the West Cork man, especially with CJ Stander having retired. In total, Farrell used 34 of his 38-man squad over the last two weeks and although Tom Daly, Peter Dooley, Ross Molony and Michael Lowry will be disappointed not to have experienced any game-time, the Ireland head coach has generally taken a measured approach in introducing new players to Test rugby. Unlucky O'Toole and Baloucoune are good examples of that, as they had both been in camp on a couple of occasions, getting a feel for this level before handling the step up. For the four unlucky ones who were left out, the hope is that they will be all the better for the experience and be even more hungry to impress next season. Ireland face a huge year, as Farrell begins to turn his attention to the autumn home Tests, which are understood to be against the All Blacks, Argentina, Japan and a rematch with the USA in Vegas. Improvements will be expected on Farrell's two consecutive third-place Six Nations finishes before Ireland travel to New Zealand for a mouth-watering three-Test series next summer. By then, almost a year out from the World Cup, we will have a better understanding of where Ireland sit in the grand scheme of things. Thumping a poor USA outfit at home only told us so much, but there is no doubt solid foundations have been laid. The big question now is: how will Farrell and his brains trust go about building on this platform? Supporters want to see a more attractive brand of rugby, and while none of them will be naive to think Ireland will adopt a similarly carefree attitude against the likes of the All Blacks, a slight shift in approach could make a major difference. For now, Farrell can reflect on a positive summer series, aware that the pressure is about to crank up a notch as he enters the second half of his masterplan.

Labour Party leader Alan Kelly, who championed the route in 2014 as Environment Minister, said yesterday: 'This greenway will be iconic once complete. Throughout the past year, we have seen the huge appetite for these types of amenities from those holidaying at home. The economic impact of similar developments has been hugely positive. 'This greenway has the potential to really boost the south Kerry economy, creating jobs in the towns and villages along its route from bike hires to coffee huts to tours.

Jimmy Cherizier - otherwise known as Barbecue - who leads a federation of gangs called G9, said in a televised address that gang members should rally in public to demand ""light be shed on the president's assassination"". Mr Cherizier's intervention came after Claude Joseph, the acting prime minister, called for help from US and UN troops as he tried to fend off at least three other rivals for power and avert a slide into street violence. President Moise was shot at his Port-au-Prince residence on Wednesday in what Haitian authorities say was a contract killing by Colombian and American mercenaries. Haitian authorities say 28 people - 26 Colombian and two American - were involved in the assassination. Of these, eight are still at large and 17 were paraded in front of the cameras last week. Mr Joseph has been broadly internationally recognised as the legitimate head of the interim government, but several figures inside the country have challenged his authority. Earlier, Ariel Henry, a 71-year old neurosurgeon who Mr Moise appointed as prime minister two days before he was killed, claimed he was the legitimate interim ruler and accused Mr Joseph of mounting a ""coup"" against him. Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, with nearly a quarter of the 11 million population living below the poverty line. It has long been divided between the bulk of the population and a small wealthy elite and for decades it was a kleptocracy ruled by the Duvaliers - first Papa Doc and then his son Baby Doc, who was ousted in a military coup in 1986. Mr Cherizier, whose G9 is one of about 30 gangs police believe control roughly half the capital, described Mr Moise's assassination as part of a national and international conspiracy against Haiti. Wearing military fatigues, he also railed against businessmen of Syrian and Lebanese descent, who he described as ""masters of the system"" who dominate the country's politics and economy. ""It's time for black people with kinky hair like us to own supermarkets, to have car dealerships and own banks,"" he said. Mr Cherizier has tried to redefine himself as a political figure in recent weeks. He is widely thought to be allied to Mr Moise, and the words were interpreted as a warning to opposition figures blocking the president's plan for constitutional and political reform."

The survey from the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) also suggests that moves by small landlords to exit the rental market over the next five years will affect supply and see average rents accelerate even more quickly. Affordability is a central issue in the report published today, with rent levels often seen as out of tenants' control and not linked to income.  Tenants are paying on average 36 per cent of their net income on rent, with half spending more than 30 per cent of their take-home pay on rent, climbing to 64 per cent in the greater Dublin area.  Mortgage  When speaking to researchers, tenants outlined multiple reasons for renting including easy access to work and school and because they were unsure where they wanted to live in the long term. However, one in five said they were renting because they could not get a mortgage, with a further 15 per cent saying they were renting while saving a deposit for their own home. A significant percentage of those polled believe Central Bank rules on mortgage lending make it more difficult for them to buy their own homes.  The report is one of the largest studies undertaken of the rental sector in Ireland and suggests there is ""no real evidence of the stereotypical conflicts"" with both landlords and tenants largely happy with their respective relationships. Positive  All told, 79 per cent of tenants described their experience renting in the private sector as either positive or very positive, while 88 per cent of small landlords rated their experience with their tenants as ""positive"" or ""very positive"". While most small landlords appear set to remain in the market for the foreseeable future, their contribution will decline as the market changes, the report says, with 26 per cent of small landlords planning to sell a rental property in the next five years.  The report brings together the findings of several surveys, including 1,038 face-to-face with tenants and 500 by phone with landlords last year, and further in-depth interviews since."

As Italian supporters piled out of Wembley in the early hours of yesterday morning, carefully navigating a path through the mass of broken glass, empty beer cans and other rubbish strewn across the ground, they were 'welcomed' onto the tube heading back into central London by banks of noisy England fans. An hour or so earlier, Gareth Southgate had shown how to lose with dignity and class. Moments after Gianluigi Donnarumma had pushed away Bukayo Saka's penalty, the England manager walked to the Italian bench, seeking out Roberto Mancini and his backroom staff, offering congratulations. Southgate leaves this tournament as a statesmanlike figure. It is his emphasis on simple things like decency and respect. He has done much to transform the team, on the pitch and off it, building a bond between fans and players, making a country proud of its footballers again. The problem is, there is little he can do to make his country loved by others. England don't have many friends abroad. Nights like this, and the behaviour of some - it really is only some - show why. In recent times, this England team has been an example of the good in society. It is embodied by Marcus Rashford, a shining light of our time, twisting defences one day, turning government policy the next, filling young people with food and with hope. Or Harry Kane, leading the line for his country while leading the fight off the pitch to save local football fields. Tyrone Mings' work in the Players Together campaign raised funds for the NHS; Raheem Sterling has taken aim with purpose, not just in the penalty box but at online racists. But the English national team also brings out the worst of wider society, a lightning rod for a fringe element that big tournaments such as this seem to draw. It was brewing from late morning on Sunday, as several thousand took over Leicester Square. Hope was in the air, but also beer bottles, and a tree which had been uprooted and hurled at a Burger King outlet, shattering a window. Mostly it was harmless. At least it seemed harmless. England fans think they are harmless, but to many they don't look harmless, particularly when abroad, with their bare chests, carryouts, flags pinned to the walls, taking over city squares in the manner of an occupying army. At Wembley, as kick-off neared, the area outside became a scene of chaos and carnage. Many without tickets had arrived, those heading to the game having to push their way through thick crowds. Already the ground was sticky with spilt beer and the air heavy with apprehension. I had covered every Wembley game over the last month but, for the first time, this just didn't have the right feel or atmosphere. As kick-off neared, and the crowd swelled and choruses of the Ten German Bombers song grew louder, some tried to force their way into the stadium, some succeeding, finding their way to seats and cramming into spaces. At the same time an FA statement was being hurriedly issued saying no security breaches had taken place, one Uefa volunteer was reporting ""50 to 100"" ticketless fans in his section. ""We are volunteers, we are not meant to be stewards,"" he said. He questioned what was happening in other areas of the ground. It was obvious some were beyond capacity. One area to the left of the end England were attacking in the first half looked particularly overrun. For such a big occasion, and with the host nation reaching the final, the policing was woefully ill-prepared. Wembley Way is a bottleneck at the best of times, hemmed in by hotels and cafés. You have to question why ticketless fans were allowed so close to the ground. All this, of course, during a pandemic. Video footage showed a handful of despairing volunteers chasing after dozens of people who had forced their way through one gap, before spreading out in every direction. In another, three stewards, hopelessly outnumbered, can be seen trying to hold back another charge of the Three Lions brigade, before being overrun. As the teams took to the pitch, the Italian anthem was jeered - naturally. Towards the end of the 90 minutes, a man - topless, naturally - evaded the security and invaded the pitch. You did fear what an England defeat might mean, but as Saka's penalty was saved and Giorgio Chiellini strode to lift the trophy, it was largely calm. There were queues of more than two hours - via discarded rubbish and smashed glass - to reach the tube station a few hundred yards away and board packed trains bound for central London, amid unsavoury chants about pasta and other features of Italian culture. In Withington, near Manchester, a mural of Rashford, who had missed in the shootout, was vandalised within an hour of the game finishing. In the moments after Saka's missed penalty which cost England so dearly, as Southgate was reaching out a comforting arm, consoling the distraught teenager, others were reaching for their keyboards, jabbing messages of spite. Yesterday morning, in a Zoom briefing, Southgate addressed the abuse forcefully. ""For some of them to be abused is unforgivable, really. I know a lot of that has come from abroad. The people who track those things have been able to explain that - but not all of it, and it is just not what we stand for,"" he said. ""People should be able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everyone, and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together."" On the issue of how to address the wider issue of fans who are disrespectful, abusive and violent, he added: ""We can't control that, we can only set the example that we believe we should, and represent the country in the way that we feel that we should when you are representing England."" This was the day when football was supposed to come home for England. Instead, some truths hit home. England have ambitions of hosting the World Cup in 2030.

HOW ETTA SAVED THE BIRDS; CONSTANCE CRAIG SMITH SOCIETY,FALSE,"SITTING in a London church in 1887, a young woman gazed over the congregation and the sea of elegant ladies' hats. In her notebook, she jotted down the names of the birds whose feathers decorated those hats ? swallows, robins, blue tits, chaffinches, hummingbirds and even eagles and herons. Just as she did every week, she would write to each of the hat wearers, calmly describing the slaughter of the birds who had ended up as their fashion accessories. Today, her name is almost entirely forgotten. Yet, as this beguiling book shows, Etta Lemon is one of the great heroines of nature conservation. Her long and doughty campaign against 'murderous millinery' led to the founding of the Royal Society For The Protection Of Birds (RSPB) and saved millions of birds. Born Etta Smith in 1860, she grew up on the Kent coast and developed a passion for birds at an early age. For many of her contemporaries, though, birds were nothing more than a source of brightly coloured feathers for their hats. Hats were big business ? in 1891, central London alone had 548 milliners ? and feathers were an essential adornment. Women who couldn't afford their own exotic feather would club together to buy one, taking it in turns to wear it on their best hat. By the time Etta reached her 20s, there was a ghastly new trend for hats decorated with the corpses of birds: 'whole owls' heads with staring glass eyes were all the rage ? along with the breasts and wings of brightly coloured parrots,' Tessa Boase writes. Tiny songbirds were used to trim bodices and decorate capes, or arranged to look as if they were flying out of collars. In 1891, Emily Williamson from Manchester launched the all-female Society For The Protection Of Birds to campaign against the killing of birds for 'avian adornment'. The following year Etta, now married to lawyer Frank Lemon, became its Honorary Secretary, bringing organisational skill and boundless energy to the cause. Within two years, membership had reached 10,000 and the women were tireless in their efforts to persuade others to 'take the pledge' to eschew feathers. Their sympathisers included Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII and, in 1904 the society was given a Royal Charter and became the RSPB. Tessa Boase draws many parallels between Etta's championing of birds and Emmeline Pankhurst's long fight for women's votes; the Women's Social And Political Union, set up to campaign for female suffrage, was founded in 1903. You might expect the two organisations to have had plenty in common but they viewed each other with deep suspicion. Mrs Pankhurst believed suffragettes needed to be well dressed to convince the public they were 'womanly' rather than screaming viragos, and extravagantly large hats, often trimmed with feathers, were an important part of their image. In short, she had little time for bird enthusiasts. Etta (pictured), for her part, opposed the campaign for women's votes. When the rules of the Royal Charter stipulated that a woman couldn't be the RSPB's honorary secretary, she cheerfully handed over the role to her husband. For all Etta's energy and campaigning skills, there was little public enthusiasm for outlawing the killing of birds for fashion and they were still being slaughtered on an industrial scale for the British market. In just one month in 1907, one London wholesaler sold 20,000 kingfisher carcasses. Etta may have disliked the suffragettes, but she could see their shock tactics were effective. In 1911, the RSPB hired ten men to walk through central London wearing sandwich boards depicting an egret's story, showing the egret chicks starving to death after their parents were killed for their feathers. Posters of the picture went up all around London. The stunt worked and the tide of public opinion began to turn, though it wasn't until 1921 that the Plumage Act, banning the import of exotic feathers, finally became law. There's no doubt that Britain was shamefully slow to act ? in America a similar law had been passed nine years earlier and women arriving from England on liners often had their hats confiscated at the New York docks. Etta worked tirelessly for the RSPB for another 18 years, until she was unceremoniously forced into retirement. After that, she was more or less airbrushed from its history. When the first edition of this book was published three years ago, the RSPB website carried little information on Etta Lemon and her picture wasn't even on display in its headquarters. Now, Tessa Boase reports, that has been put right and Etta's enormous contribution to nature conservation is acknowledged. Boase writes warmly and sympathetically about the redoubtable Mrs Lemon, even while admitting she is 'a hard woman to love': blunt and so relentless that people would hide rather than risk being harangued by her. Well, thank goodness for Etta and women like her. Our wildlife, would be much poorer without them."

The Cabinet yesterday proposed to amend lobbying laws to make it an offence to breach the one-year ""cooling-off"" rule for ministers and senior Government officials after they depart office. It comes after a review of the Lobbying Act prompted controversy after former minister of State for financial services Michael D'Arcy left politics to head the Irish Association of Investment Managers (IAIM). Mr D'Arcy, who was a Fine Gael minister of State in the Department of Finance up until June 2020, left his subsequent role as a senator last year to take up the job with the IAIM. The cooling-off term bans such people for lobbying for a year and the obligation can only be varied by a decision of the Standards in Public Office Commission. When appointing Mr D'Arcy, the IAIM said it had legal advice that the appointment did not breach rules. Mr Hayes was also a former Fine Gael minister of State at the Department of Finance but he left to become an MEP in 2014. The cooling-off period did not apply to him, since he had not been a minister for five years before.  'Transparent way' Having brought the proposal to Cabinet, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said: ""The public want to be reassured that government policy is formulated in an open and transparent way.""  Clear rules about lobbying are essential, he said, where people know ""who is talking to whom about what"", but which also allows the State's system to be able to hear voices that should be heard. ""Public concern had arisen in relation to former ministers and advisers taking up lobbying roles soon after leaving office. I am taking action to address this issue,"" he said."

Pride that Stephen Bradley's charges rose to a stiff challenge and produced their best performance of 2021 in their most important game. But there were regrets and recriminations arising from the build-up to the goal from Vladimir Weiss that ultimately settled this encounter and sent the Hoops out of the Champions League. Giddiness hung in the air after Rovers found the two-goal lead they needed to level this tie up. However, it was punctured as an apparent foul on Roberto Lopes went unpunished and the passage of play ended with ex-Man City and Rangers winger Weiss dropping the shoulder and curling the ball beyond Alan Mannus. It means Rovers will have to continue their European campaign in the new Europa Conference League. Game Over Bradley admitted that it would have been 'game over' for the Hoops if Weiss, back from Euro 2020 duty, had managed to find a way past Alan Mannus with his injury time penalty in the first leg. Buoyed by that let-off, Rovers started this game at a level above last week and, in truth, the majority of their domestic performances this term. It yielded them a lead goal, with risk taking and braver passing in the opposition half at the heart of it. Holding midfielder Gary O'Neill was on point with his first half distribution and he was central in the lead-up to the penalty area foul by Slovan skipper Vasil Bozhikov on Graham Burke that roused the 1,500 natives permitted to attend this fixture. Burke dusted him- self down to finish confidently. The volume went up a notch and a Slovan team with 284 international cap between them endured a few testing moments in the aftermath, although they quickly flipped that pressure to the other end where a fine double save by Mannus was required. Under the old rules, an away goal would have killed the tie, but Rovers weren't playing that game of jeopardy here. From the restart, Slovan initially tried to press vigorously, which meant the challenge for the Rovers back three was to play through the press and find space. Danny Mandroiu's inclusion in a central role gave the Hoops another technical option in deeper areas, with Burke also roaming in an attempt to get involved. Both had started as subs last week. Joey O'Brien's return to the defence also provided a calming presence, and he really shone in a crucial period around the hour mark where Rovers moved things up the park. On the other side, left wing-back Liam Scales showed why his reputation is growing with a pair of sprightly breaks. Scales is attracting attention from over the water. But it was a player that has just returned who levelled things up, with Richie Towell collecting a Rory Gaffney pass and sending a right footed thunderbolt into the top corner. Slovan boss Vladimir Weiss, the former national team manager and the father of their most recognisable player, was beginning to look uncomfortable on the sideline. His son stepped up to save the day, with Rovers fans and players crying unfair as their spirited attempt to muster a response fell short.

However, senior party figures have now circled the wagons around their Taoiseach with Education Minister Norma Foley telling RTÉ's The Week in Politics that Mr Martin should lead Fianna Fáil into the next general election despite the party's disastrous result in the Dublin Bay South by-election. Significantly, one of the most likely beneficiaries of any leadership heave, the politically astute Michael McGrath, tweeted that now was the time for people in Fianna Fáil to support the Taoiseach and show 'unity of purpose'. One senior source asked: 'Are we seriously going to engage in a soap opera in a week where we are also trying to re-open the Irish hospitality industry? 'Big Jim and Marc would turn us into a laughing stock.' Separately, Ms Foley, a long-term political associate of Mr Martin who was appointed Minister for Education on her first day as a TD, conceded: 'After any election there is going to be a post-mortem and it was not a good day for Fianna Fáil. There is a job of work to be done.' She rejected the possibility that there would be ten TDs who would sign a motion against Mr Martin. Ms Foley added, in response to queries as to whether Mr Martin would lead Fianna Fáil into the next election: 'Absolutely. Micheál is a very experienced, solutionfocused leader. 'We see the benefit of that in Government, we also see the benefit of that in Fianna Fáil.' In what will be seen in the party as a more significant intervention, the Minister of State in Higher Education Niall Collins also moved to stabilise the uncertain political situation. He said: 'As a party, we will of course assess the lessons learnt from the very disappointing result. This will be done as it is after all elections. 'However, we all have to remember that we are in the middle of a global pandemic and the Taoiseach and Government are making decisions to put the country first.' Mr Collins also warned any rebels that the much-feared party grassroots was not supportive of their ambitions. He warned: 'They are very unhappy with the comments from some of the Parliamentary Party. 'They want Fianna Fáil to put the country first like it always does.' In a sharp criticism of the rebels, Mr Collins added: 'We are implementing the national recovery plan. 'We are now getting 180,000 people back to work in the hospitality sector in the next few days. 'It is time to concentrate on improving people's lives rather than rattling party-political cages. We need to get on with the job that people elected us to do.' Mr Collins is believed to represent the critical centre ground of the party. One source noted: 'Collins is not in Micheál's court or any other court. He is a bellwether figure in the party though. If someone like Collins were to say it is time to go, the clock would definitively be ticking on Micheál.' Another TD warned: 'We would look like worse clowns than the Greens if we tried to butcher the leader in the middle of a pandemic.' Mr O'Callaghan also appeared to back away from his initially sharp criticism of the party leader, noting that he 'would not sign a motion of no confidence in the party leader'. He said: 'The question we need to ask is ""why are we not connecting with the electorate?"".' Asked if he had been approached by anyone to sign a motion of noconfidence, he said: 'That hasn't happened, and I wouldn't.' Mr O'Callaghan said he was interested in leading the party but would not do anything to undermine Mr Martin. 'I believe it's an honour and a privilege [to lead the party], but I'm not going to do anything just to undermine the leader or give the media an impression that there's something going on when I don't think there is,' he said. One top level Fianna Fáil figure noted: 'Big Jim marched his troops down the hill into quicksand and now cannot get away fast enough.' Another TD warned: 'As of now, Micheál has a slim majority, but his best card is the absence of contenders. 'That is not a secure place, to put it mildly.' Mr Martin has defended his position, noting that 'Governments rarely win in by-elections. 'They are not markers in terms of what happens at the next general election. 'This constituency is not our strongest constituency; it never has been.

Mr Justice Richard Humphreys, in a judgment on Monday on two separate challenges to the development, ruled the permission is valid. He will hear a further module in the case in November to address claims Ireland has not correctly transposed the type of road projects that require environmental impact screening and assessment under European Union law.  He will also consider claims An Bord Pleanála breached public-information requirements of the Roads Act regarding inadequate publication, on its website and in local newspapers, of material and of its decision. Whatever the outcome of that module, it will not impact on the validity of the permission decision, he stressed. Because of that, he said he was ""provisionally minded"" to discharge the stay on the works after final orders arising from his judgment are made. He will hear submissions in that regard later this month. Kerry County Council had sought permission for a 31.9km greenway between Glenbeigh and Renard. Last November, the board granted permission for a 27km greenway between Glenbeigh to just outside Cahersiveen, to run mainly along the disused route of the Southern and Western Railway.  It will include a three-metre wide paved surface and 122 different types of intersection with other routes. Lesser horseshoe bat The permission is subject to several conditions, including an ecological pre-construction survey to check for the presence of protected species, including the Kerry slug and lesser horseshoe bat, and for those to be relocated to a similar habitat, subject to a derogation licence where required. That permission was subject of two challenges, one by a local farmer, James Clifford, and environmental activist Peter Sweetman.  The second was by a number of local landowners whose lands have been compulsorily acquired for the greenway. The cases were against the board and various State parties, with the council a notice party. The grounds of challenge in the Clifford/Sweetman case include claims that the permission contravened EU directives on environmental impact assessment and habitats and failed to ensure a system of strict protection for the Kerry slug and lesser horseshoe bat in their natural range. The landowners raised issues about the process resulting in the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs). The judge rejected arguments of incorrect use of the Roads Act by the council in acquiring the lands for the project or that the processes of CPO and development consent were improperly combined. He rejected arguments that the CPO was disproportionate and he found the interference with the landowners' property rights was taken in a lawful manner in the public interest. There was no error in the council looking at economic and population decline in the region in determining whether there was a public need for the CPO, he held. The judge dismissed various other grounds of challenge, including claims of a lack of reasons for the board's approval decision. Various grounds of challenge based on alleged breach of EU law, including failure to establish a system of ""strict protection"" for the Kerry slug, were also rejected. "

Indeed it must. By deciding not to join 130 other countries in signalling consent at this stage, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is indicating that he needs more clarity on the part of the plan relating to a minimum corporate tax rate, a key issue for Ireland given the long-standing 12.5 per cent rate.  There are reputational costs in holding out, as just eight countries have not signed the outline agreement, though if Ireland signs up later this year this initial reluctance may soon be forgotten. The pressures on Ireland are all the greater given the slow pace at which some of the more controversial tax incentives - notably the double Irish scheme - were phased out in recent years. These strategic errors have now led to a political cost. The general political support for the reform programme was underlined again at the G20 summit in Venice this weekend, which called for countries who had not already done so to sign up. It is likely a deal will be done, but not certain. There are gaps on some key details of the plan and tensions between the European Union and the United States. But perhaps the greatest doubt relates to what happens in US domestic politics. The Biden administration is trying to push through a major spending programme, funded in part by higher taxes on companies. To persuade Congress to accept higher corporate taxes at home, the US is keen to get the international plan agreed. However, the domestic politics are difficult and it is unclear what Congress may agree. For Ireland, this creates significant uncertainty, given that most of the overseas investment here comes from the US. If the US can't pass its plan at home, then the future of the OECD process is unclear. If a new OECD rate is agreed - probably of 15 per cent - and the US applies the same rate in its domestic legislation, then there will clearly be no point in Ireland trying to hold out. Nor would this be reasonable, given the necessity to increase the tax take from major multinationals and reduce their ability for aggressive tax planning. Ireland has already signalled it will agree to the other part of the tax plan - which initial estimates suggest will cost the exchequer upwards of EUR 2 billion a year. This involves changes in where big companies pay tax, with some in future paid in markets where sales are made. But pressure will build on the minimum tax issue.  As the talks progress, Ireland has national interests to safeguard and it is reasonable to look for clarity on what the minimum rate will be. But the Government must remain fully involved and prepared to play its part in the move to close off a system which has offered too much advantage to big multinationals. "

Conor Ryan, 45, from Co Waterford, plans to donate one of the life-saving machines to a GAA club in each county in Ireland before placing a few more in his home county and picking the best suggestions from the public. He told the Irish Sun: ""The reason I want to raffle off my house is, number one, I want to be able to help with the rollout of defibrillators around the country."" Dad-of-one Conor, who was initially planning on selling his house, said he was watching Denmark's opening Euro 2020 game against Finland when Eriksen went down on the pitch - and revealed that at that point he realised he could make a difference. Eriksen, 29, was given life-saving treatment on the pitch by medics, although it was Denmark skipper Simon Kjaer who first administered CPR to his team-mate. The Dane was taken to the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen after being resuscitated but returned home on June 18 after having a cardioverter defibrillator implanted. Conor also recalled reading in the Irish Sun recently about Ireland manager Stephen Kenny, who revealed he collapsed and needed a defibrillator too after a U21s game in Sweden in 2019. He said: ""I'm a big soccer fan and I was watching the Denmark game when Eriksen collapsed and that is what really sparked the idea in me, that I could do something to maybe help one community in every county. ""The whole Christian Eriksen thing was shocking. The fact it was a really fit footballer who I'm sure gets tested for all these things with their clubs all the time. It puts it into focus for me that it can happen to anyone at any time. I also read on the back page of the Irish Sun about how Stephen Kenny collapsed in Sweden and a defibrillator had to be used."" He added: ""So there has been a number of high profile incidents. ""There is a lack of defibrillators around the country and I'm going to roll out 32, one for every county, and another couple in my county Waterford - and if I could help even one person to save their life it'll be worth it."" A ticket for the raffle, run by Raffall, will cost £10 (about (EURO)11.70) and the lucky punter will walk away with Conor's Dungarvan house, (EURO)5,000 and his Hyundai IX35 SUV. The raffle to win the threebed semi-detached home will either end on Wednesday, December 15 or when 50,000 tickets are sold. Conor continued: ""Someone could win a house for a tenner and I could install 40 defibrillators around the country which will help to save a life. The house will be completely owned by the person who wins, they can do what they want with it, they can rent it or live with it. Out of the money, the draw will bring in, I'll then purchase 40 defibrillators - one GAA club in every county will win one. ""Out of the remaining eight, I'm going to put two in Waterford city, I'm going to put two in Dungarvan - one in the town and one at the start of the Waterford Greenway. ""I'm going to put one in my local school where I was educated when I was a young lad and I'm going to have three leftover and I'm going to ask people for suggestions and I'll pick the best. I'd have no bother selling my house in Dungarvan at the moment as loads of people are working from home, people are sort of moving from the bigger cities back home to Dungarvan. ""If I just sold my house I couldn't roll out 40 defibrillators, I wouldn't make enough money. ""I could sell it and then I would be finished with it but this way I can actually do something for one club in each county. But I just want these defibs to be accessible to people in a whole locality."" Statistics from the Irish Heart Foundation show that for every minute without CPR or defibrillation a person's chances of survival decrease by ten per cent. In 2019, there were 2,564 cardiac arrests where emergency services attended. Out of these 84 per cent received CPR from a bystander but just 190 people went home to their families - which puts the survival rate at 7.4 per cent. And IHF said 70 per cent of cardiac arrests happen in the home and urged everyone to know how to recognise the symptoms. IHF's Brigid Sinnott said: ""This is a great gesture from Conor. He has identified the importance of having AEDs available and accessible in communities across Ireland.

Using last Wednesday's 2-0 defeat as primary evidence, 1,500 Shamrock Rovers fans are praying tonight's guests are blinded by an overwhelming superiority complex.  In truth, Alan Mannus made three wonder stops to keep this tie on life support.  Vladimir Weiss - the son and namesake of Slovan's manager - really should have put Rovers out of their misery in Bratislava, but his delicate lob was blocked by Mannus before the Northern Ireland goalkeeper pulled off a heroic penalty save in injury time.  ""You pick a side and you go,"" the 39-year-old explained.  Weiss will be sharper for the extra week to recover from a Euros campaign where he was used sparingly off the Slovakian bench.  ""With [David] Holman injured, he could well start, he's a top player,"" said Rovers manager Stephen Bradley who confirmed that the gulf in talent between the clubs was exacerbated by stifling conditions in the Slovak capital.  'Game time'  ""It was incredibly hot,"" Bradley confirmed. ""We have played in Cyprus but Cyprus was nothing like that as it was a lot calmer when it was game time. Game time in the arena was 36 degrees, which was incredible. So it was definitely a factor in the game, but you can't control that.""  Maybe the increased attendance can inspire the SSE Airtricity League champions to keep Rafael Ratão in check or deny Ibrahim Rabiu the run of Tallaght with a more sustained press.  An early goal would alter a growing narrative that paints the Hoops as out of their depth against a side that looked substantially slicker than them last week.

But it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be funny",FALSE,"Ihave learned so much about real life from watching Sex/Life (Netflix). For instance, did you know that it is virtually impossible to tell when sexy American men and their sexy Australian counterparts are trying to make you laugh? In episode three of Stacy Rukeyser's provocative, eight-part melodrama, an investment banker named Cooper (Mike Vogel) decides to stalk his wife's ex-boyfriend, a smooth-talking record company executive named Brad (Adam Demos). Cooper, whose mountain-esque jawline could stop time if it wanted to, tracks Brad (who looks as though he was made in a lab after a mad scientist typed the words 'Make Sexy Australian Man' into a computer) to a fancy, VIP gym in NYC. Once inside, Cooper wastes $600 on a membership and spends most of his time staring at Brad from across the room. Eventually, the boys hit the showers where a naked Cooper finally works up the courage to approach a naked Brad. Alas, that's when he sees it. That's when we all see it. Let's just say that Cooper might have, erm, bigger things to worry about, and that it's a wonder Brad is able to find a pair of jeans that fit. The scene ends with Cooper gently punching the shower wall in a mild-mannered jealous rage, while Brad wanders off to dry himself with an XL towel. Everyone you know is watching Sex/Life. At the time of writing, it is the most streamed drama on Netflix - and yes, the shower scene made a gazillion headlines this week. Here's my question: is it supposed to be funny? Because I almost choked on my tea during the big reveal. Or, does Rukeyser expect us to take Sex/Life seriously? Honestly, I can't tell. It is as though the people involved would like us to make our own minds up about it, and whichever view is the most popular (horny soap opera or sensational spoof) is the one they'll go with. At least the story is simple. Sarah Shahi is Billie Connelly (no, not that one), a former psychology PhD candidate who wakes up one morning and decides that her life with hunky husband, Cooper (the aforementioned mannequin, with incredible hair and debilitating penis envy), is not what she expected. They have two kids, a lovely house in Connecticut and all the money in the world. Unfortunately, it's not enough for Billie who, before marrying strait-laced Cooper, always went for the bad boy. She misses the bad boys, especially Brad. It doesn't help matters that Billie and Cooper have stopped having sex. Instead of talking to her husband about what's wrong, she starts a sex memory journal on her Mac. One day, Cooper 'accidentally' reads the journal and decides to get busy (with his wife) or die tryin' (at one stage, he almost gets them killed in a car accident). Oh, and for reasons that make no sense whatsoever, Brad re-enters the equation. Sex/Life, inspired by a novel, 44 Chapters About 4 Men by BB Easton, goes in heavy on the sex bit, but sort of forgets about the life part. It's Fifty Shades, minus the red room, but with added sincerity (let's not forget the bit where Billie compares a steamy car romp to climbing Mount Everest). It's Sex and the City, minus the selfawareness. It's expensive, outlandish eroticism, basically, and I just wish I knew what it expected from me. Speaking of expensive, a new series of Ireland's Rich List (RTÉ One) kicked off this week, with Richard Curran counting down a list of people who have way more money than the rest of us. You know the drill. Taking findings from the annual Sunday Times Rich List, Curran and his team chew the fat on the big economic winners and losers over the past 12 months. The enthusiastic contributors (journalists, PR types) do their best to keep us on side in a show that looks and sounds as though it was edited on Windows 95. Together, they amaze us with stories of marvellous meat moguls (Larry Goodman, now worth an eye-watering (EURO)3.2bn) and tactical tech entrepreneurs (Patrick and John Collison, founders of Stripe, currently sitting on a collective fortune of 20bn). It's a proper countdown, too, with splashy, gold coin visuals and bopping background bangers, like a Top of the Pops special that people such as Cooper from Sex/Life would enjoy. My favourite bit was when Norman Crowley, CEO of Cool Planet Group and Studio AVA, talked about his business of taking classic cars and making them electric. For instance, Crowley (a future Rich List player, says Curran) recently worked on a 1981 Ferrari, removing all the 1981 bits and turning it into what he claims is a better car. Which, if you ask me, makes about as much sense as Trigger from Only Fools and Horses maintaining his famous broom by replacing both the brush and its handle. Something else that confused me this week was High: Confessions of an Ibiza Drug Mule (BBC One), in which Michaella McCollum tells us what it was like when she and fellow mule, Melissa Reid, attempted to smuggle 11kg of cocaine from Peru to Spain in 2013. It really is the Michaella McCollum show (Reid is missing from this disjointed and unreliable five-part series), with one half of the so-called 'Peru Two' filling in the blanks over superficial narration and dodgy and dramatised reconstructions. Unfortunately, the narrative is still all over the shop, and McCollum's story just doesn't make sense, at least not the way it's presented here. Oh, and a disclaimer at the top tells us that ""only some of the facts can be verified"". Um, that's not a great start, lads.

At a meeting of the Dail's Public Accounts Committee yesterday, officials from the NPHDB and the Department of Health again refused to disclose the latest total cost of the project, citing commercial sensitivity. Chief officer of the NPHDB David Gunning warned of ""inadvertently giving targets to the contractor that they look at with a great degree of desire to land"". Speaking about BAM's 906 claims, Mr Gunning said ""claims are a part of construction contracts"" but that those costs are not guaranteed to be awarded, and will be fought by the NPHDB. He continued: ""One of our main tasks, I would say, is defending each and every one of these claims. The claims defence, the budget put in place for that was of the order of (EURO)15million.""

Mr Gunning added: ""This does not remove the risk of claims, nor does it mean that we will not continue to receive claims."" The hospital, which is being built on the site of St James's Hospital in Dublin, has been beset by spiralling costs that have escalated to (EURO)1.433billion. The committee also heard that the Covid pandemic and Brexit will place ""pressure on the availability of essential supplies"", which will have a potential impact on the project's cost and delivery timelines. Many TDs and Senators criticised officials from the NPHDB and the Department of Health for their refusal to reveal the latest costs of the project. Sinn Fein TD Matt Carthy said the Department had repeatedly provided cost updates in the past, including (EURO)800million in 2016, (EURO)983million in 2017 and (EURO)1.43billion in December 2019. He asked: ""Were you not cognisant of commercial sensitivities at spiralling costs that stage?"" Fiona Prendergast, an official at the Department of Health, replied: ""At that stage, the contract either had not been signed, or we were in an early stage. ""We're midway through a contract with the main contractor at this stage, and it is not appropriate to now consider discussing this in open forum.""

Four out of five estate agents surveyed predict that national property prices will rise in the next year. In Dublin the rise is expected to be around 4pc, in Leinster 6pc, and in Munster, Connacht and Ulster prices are expected to increase by as much as 7pc. In cash terms, a 7pc increase on a (EURO)200,000 home outside of Dublin would equate to an increase of (EURO)14,000, while a 4pc increase on a (EURO)400,000 home in Dublin would mean an increase of (EURO)16,000. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI)/ Central Bank of Ireland Residential Property Price Survey gathered responses from more than 200 estate agents in May. Agents said the higher price forecast for properties outside Dublin reflected the ""Covid effect"" and the increased attractiveness of regional properties due to the rise in people working from home. The predicted rise in prices also takes into account the low housing stock levels and increasing numbers of inquiries and viewings reported by 80pc of agents surveyed. TJ Cronin, president of the SCSI, said a lack of supply, construction lockdowns and steep increases in the price of materials meant prices would continue to rise. ""While prospective sellers were reluctant to put their property on the market, buyers, who in many cases were in a position to increase their savings, were left chasing a reducing number of properties,"" he said. ""Over the last 16 months the construction sector was closed down several times and the cumulative impact of the slowdown on new home construction will be with us until 2023 at least. ""Significant increases in the price of steel, timber, plastic and insulation products - due to supply chain and transportation issues - and labour shortages across a number of trades will also lead to higher prices for new homes,"" he added. Shirley Coulter, CEO of the SCSI, said the pandemic had deepened the housing crisis, and extraordinary measures were now needed to address it. ""We believe 400,000 new homes - social, affordable and private builds - will need to be built over the next 10 years to meet pent-up demand and the needs of our growing population,"" she said. ""We support the ESRI's recent recommendation to Government to double its current investment in housing by borrowing between (EURO)4bn and (EURO)7bn a year while availing of low interest rates.

Asking prices are climbing by an average of (EURO)100 daily as strong demand and low supply of new and second hand homes on the market combine to increase pressure on values. As well as the boom in mortgage lending in April, March saw an increase of 10% on the (EURO)617million recorded in February 2021. With the average house price of (EURO)304,000, the latest loan figures represent enough cash to buy more than 2,270 homes. Housing campaigner David Hall of the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation said the combination of strong mortgage lending combined with record savings and the low stock of houses on the market will push up prices. The number of homes on the market is 12,700 at the end of June which is down 31% on the year and is just 0.6% of the two million homes in the Republic.

More than 200 estate agents belonging to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) were asked for their opinion on future price trends for its July residential property market monitor report. ""We had a supply crisis pre-Covid and that has simply deepened due to Covid,"" said SCSI president TJ Cronin. The survey of SCSI estate agents revealed some regional variation in the expected price movements. Agents in Munster and Connacht/Ulster expect prices to increase 7 per cent over the next 12 months, with the figure in Leinster as a whole standing at 6 per cent. But in Dublin, the predicted rise is 4 per cent. A 7 per cent increase would see a EUR 200,000 home outside Dublin rise to EUR 214,000, while a EUR 400,000 Dublin home rising 4 per cent would have a new price of EUR 416,000. Agents said the higher price forecast for housing outside Dublin reflected the effect of Covid-19 on the market as more people have been given the option to work from home. Inquiries  Eight out of 10 respondents reported a rise in inquiries and viewings in the second quarter, but a similar proportion is reporting low stock levels, Mr Cronin said.  Almost half of estate agents saw a fall in selling instructions in the second quarter, the survey found. ""While prospective sellers were reluctant to put their property on the market, buyers, who in many cases were in a position to increase their savings, were left chasing a reducing number of properties,"" he said. ""While it's a sellers' market right now, the rate of price increases we are seeing currently is not sustainable in the long term. ""Agents believe the only way to address the affordability challenge which purchasers are facing is to increase housing supply."" Last week, the Revenue Commissioners said it would take the ""quite exceptional market conditions"" into account when guiding homeowners how to value their properties for the purposes of local property tax (LPT) when new valuations are required in November. The Revenue said it would not be ""over-relying"" on recent prices, acknowledging that some areas of the country have seen sharp inflation in selling prices as a result of the squeeze on supply exacerbated by the pandemic. Mr Cronin said the cumulative impact of the slowdown on new home construction from the repeated shutdowns of the sector ""will be with us until 2023 at least"", with increases in the price of steel, timber, plastic and insulation products also contributing to higher prices for new homes. Concerns  His remarks come as a snapshot of the construction sector provided by Ulster Bank's purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed a further recovery for housing activity in June as sites reopen, but flagged concerns about the rising cost of building materials, led by steel. SCSI chief executive Shirley Coulter said extraordinary measures were now needed to address how Covid-19 has affected housing. ""We believe 400,000 new homes - social, affordable and private builds - will need to be built over the next 10 years to meet pent up demand and the needs of our growing population,"" she said. Current output is around 20,000 units so a doubling of that will require a massive increase in funding and collaboration between the private and public sector.""  The SCSI supports the ESRI's recent that the Government double its current investment in housing by borrowing between EUR 4 billion and EUR 7 billion a year, while availing of low interest rates.  ""Housing takes time and that is why it is so important to eliminate avoidable and costly delays from the planning process,"" Ms Coulter added."

The story of how England got to a second major final in 149 years of the national team is long and complicated, and is one of those confluences of the right people at the right time, when change was demanded. But it starts with Brooking, a thorn in the side of the most powerful in the 2000s, demanding that for England teams to be successful they had to pass the ball better. And to instil that culture they needed a rethink, which included the building of what would become St George's Park. Not only that, but Brooking brought Southgate into the FA twice. So convinced was he that this was the right man, he offered Southgate the Under-21s job in 2013 after Southgate had initially quit his first FA role the previous year. Brooking chuckles at the memory of that second approach: ""It would have to have been at a coaching function somewhere"". Philosophy ""I said, 'Look, we need to get a coaching philosophy and a way of playing at this new centre'. Gareth could see the opportunity. He said, 'Let's go for it'."" Brooking had fought the representatives of the professional game on the FA board - from the Premier League and Football League - for years that the 350-acre site near Burton-upon-Trent, purchased in 2001, must become the FA's football centre. He is still not sure why they relented at the third time of asking in June 2008. Brooking had been a key part of the Sport Council's lottery-funded success with Team GB at the 2000 Sydney Olympics which lead to an invite from the FA in 2004. Changing football was much harder. For years Brooking was one the few high-profile voices calling for a seachange to coaching and development, a point he had advocated in his punditry. Brooking was in despair by much of what he saw by the late 1990s. ""People were launching the ball into the corners to get long throws. Midfield bypassed. It was a torrid sight"". Many forward-thinking academy coaches wanted change, but they needed the impetus. When the famous Three Lions song was mixed in 1996, it is Brooking you can hear after Alan Hansen at the start in the clips of television pundits opining on England: ""We are not creative enough,"" he says, ""we are not positive enough"". Southgate first joined the FA in 2011 as the head of elite development. As a fully-qualified Uefa Pro License coach, he forged links with academies and coaches and, like Brooking, travelled all over to events big and small encouraging a more forward-thinking view. Smaller goals for junior players, as well as smaller pitches, fewer players per team. But progress was slow and Southgate got frustrated. He turned down the FA technical director's job in 2012 and left. The following year Brooking felt that the impetus was behind St George's Park and that Southgate was the man to push through change. ""We needed someone who was a good communicator and respected by the clubs,"" Brooking said. ""Gareth was the man to do that, and St George's Park would be the hub"". Dan Ashworth had been recruited from West Bromwich Albion by Brooking to take over as technical director and be based at St George's Park. The pieces were in place as the centre neared completion in 2012, but still questions remained. For instance, the Clairefontaine centre outside Paris, and other regional French academies run by the French football federation, took a selection of the French clubs' best boys for two years from ages 14 to 16. The French system was modelled on the FA's now defunct Lilleshall national centre. St George's Park would be a centre for football with no resident footballers. 'IT'S JUST THE START' It was the semi-final of the U-17s European Championship in 2018, and an England team that included Bukayo Saka lost on penalties to Spain. Disconsolate, the boys came back into the changing room in Chesterfield's stadium and in walked England manager Southgate. He sat down and spoke to Folarin Balogun who missed the decisive spot-kick. ""I've been there,"" he told him. ""It's just the start. You have so much to look forward to."" By then, St George's Park was five-years-old and had become a hub for coaching and, in particular, the coaches of England's junior teams. They went through exhaustive debriefs of each camp from U15s to U21s. Reddin wanted to know what each set out to achieve. Each manager, including Southgate, was expected to give a presentation and ideas were shared. Then head of development team coaching, Matt Crocker set out the template for presenting the feedback. They marked each player from A* downward. Two young prospects - Mason Mount, born in 1999, and Phil Foden, born in 2000 - were consist- ently A*. It meant each coach, including Southgate, came to know all these emerging players being shaped by the huge investment in club academies as part of the Elite Player Performance Plan. Ashworth drove the project - better quality opposition, better relationships with the club. There were two or three coaches' meetings a week, beginning every Monday morning with a 9am start at St George's Park, deep in the Staffordshire countryside. At the end of the day the national team coaches set off to watch academy games and then returned to stay over at St George's and meet again the following morning. As per the FA's deal with car manufacturer Vauxhall, all of them drove - in true Partridge style - an FA-provided Insignia. Southgate, collegiate in all other respects, preferred to pick his own car. In their meetings they were laying the plans for a new England. Better ways of coping with tournament pressures. Better sessions. Better pastoral care. Many of the U17s who won the 2017 World Cup sat GCSE exams during the European Championship in Croatia in May. They observed the players closely on camps. Southgate was keen to secure for England a junior Irish international at Aston Villa, Jack Grealish, who was rated A* and born in Solihull. Later he and Ashworth would do the same with Declan Rice. When new squads were selected at U15s level, all the boys' parents were invited to St George's Park and Southgate gave the presentation, explaining the ""England DNA"" philosophy. What was expected of the boys - as well as what the parents could expect of the FA. Brooking told Southgate in 2012 that he did not expect trophies right away. ""It was a 10-year plan and we expected to see results in time for the 2022 World Cup,"" he says. ""But then the success of 2017 happens."" Southgate was in charge of the seniors by then but still travelling as much as he could to attend the camps of junior teams. In May 2016 he had won the Under-20s Toulon Tournament with Grealish and Jordan Pickford in the side. Then in 2017 came the breakthrough. World champions at U-17s and U-20s; European champions at U-19s; another Toulon title. The next year the seniors reached the World Cup semi-final with Southgate. ""We had a five-year span of players who were really competing at top level,"" Brooking says. ""At that stage we were really heading in the right direction. Gareth will tell you that there were now people coming from all over the world to see what was happening at St George's Park."" IRRESISTIBLE MOMENTUM For years Brooking might have felt like a voice in the wilderness, but once he started pushing things happened quickly. The coaches in the English game were ready for change and Southgate was the perfect man to be the face of it for the FA. A famous former player, a man who believed in playing the right way and who had the interests of coaches and players at heart. But there were others from the FA involved in the building of St George's Park, who visited the building site week after week, and finessed the simple details that made it a success. ""It's essentially in two parts - one for the grassroots game and coaching education and another for the England teams up to seniors,"" Brooking says. They kept them discreetly separate with the privacy required for a top international team. Vociferous Incredible to think there was a time that Brooking's voice was so vociferous for change he was asked by some members of the FA board in the 2000s not to attend meetings so they could talk without him. But he bears no grudges. There was a moment, he says, that became irresistible when the improving quality of junior England teams had a noticeable effect on visiting club coaches. ""They would say, 'That's a good group you have there'. And you could see them thinking, 'We need to start doing this'."" The ""centre of it"", as Brooking likes to say, is Southgate. Once the FA's lone apostle trying to change minds, he now stands at the head of a system he helped create, with players he has known for years. He was the right man, as Brooking always believed, and when he is gone those will be some shoes to fill.

Put it out of its misery. A competition which gave us a game like yesterday's Mayo-Leitrim farce doesn't deserve to survive. Even a final for the ages won't change the fact that the Connacht SFC has become an embarrassing anachronism. Years of similar slaughters loom ahead of Leitrim and Sligo. They've fallen too far off the pace to ever regain touch. Any competition with just three contenders hardly counts as a real contest at all. So where does that leave Leinster? In competitive terms, despite the large number of entrants, there's only one actual contestant. Connacht, with three different winners in three years, is a seething cauldron compared to a province where Dublin haven't been given a decent game since 2012. Last winter's freakish results notwithstanding. Munster is a two-horse race if you're in a kind mood and a one-horse race if you're realistic. Only Ulster, where Derry's performance against Donegal suggests an impending revival which will give that province a shot in the arm. bucks the trend. But one competitive province is hardly enough to justify an obsolete system. The move towards a tiered championship is all good and well but the GAA seem to feel this can be achieved while somehow keeping the provincial championships. This year's succession of neighbourly massacres prove that tiers are not enough. The provincial championships are precisely where most of the onesided farragos which bring football into disrepute occur. Fail to address that and the separate levels of a reordered competition will just be the tiers of a clown. Mayo-Leitrim was as pointless a fixture as you could imagine. When Mayo moved 5-14 to 0-4 ahead 10 minutes into the second half the overwhelming feeling was one of embarrassment. Fortunately the reigning provincial champs eased off and the losers were allowed to save a small amount of face by swapping points with the winners from there until the end. That Leitrim seemed to have gotten off lightly with a 24-point defeat tells its own story. Pretending their performance displayed some kind of unquenchable spirit is the worst form of condescension and merely rubs salt into the wounds of a proud little county. Leitrim should never again be forced to take on Mayo. Sligo might be better off avoiding that prospect too and at least half a dozen Leinster counties should be spared the ordeal of meeting Dublin. The toll years of hammerings have inflicted on the smaller counties was obvious in the resigned way Leitrim proceeded towards their doom. Their first-half performance exhibited all the optimism of a man watching a guillotine blade whizzing towards his head. Who can blame them? The increase in professionalism and sophistication among a handful of top counties has left most others far behind. What hope could Leitrim have against a Mayo with the resources to maintain a 40-strong senior panel? The days when an outstanding crop of youngsters or an inspirational manager could engender dreams of a famous upset have disappeared. The outcome of these David and Goliath tussles might have been relatively predictable in the past but these days the encounters lack even the slightest edge. There's no scope for hope. Hurling had to confront this problem decades ago and did so by cutting loose the majority of the Association's counties. That's why we don't have a Connacht SHC and why Ulster also lost its connection with the main competition. The sad truth is that the rejigged championship necessary to end the run of virtual walkovers will have little to offer the weaker counties. Competitions which pit them solely against fellow minnows are unlikely to stir the imagination of either players or fans. Promising Leitrim youngsters will hardly make the kind of sacrifices necessary for the modern inter-county game when the only reward is a decade of meetings with Sligo, Carlow and Waterford. Despite claims that a tiered championship will benefit football's lesser lights the main consideration is to maximise the amount of matches between the game's top teams. Gentrification In a sense we're talking about the gentrification of the football championship. The smaller counties are the slum dwellers who're having their dwellings demolished so that shiny new structures can be erected in their place. The new lower tier championship is the soulless substandard suburb to which they'll be removed so the regeneration project can motor ahead. Leitrim and Sligo and Longford and Wicklow and Carlow and their peers embarrass an Association keen to make its 'product' look good in the marketplace. They are the Untouchables of the GAA caste system. Soon to be out of sight, they'll also be out of mind of those enthused by the idea of 'Champions League style' formats. That process may be logical and inevitable but it's also sad. So is the demise of the provincial championships and the meaningful rivalries it once represented. These days the gap between haves and have-nots mirrors that in society. It'll only get wider. Our most popular championship will soon be divided on a financial rather than a geographical basis.

Colm Egan and Tadgh Brosnan guide you through the key checks",FALSE,"Awell-maintained and serviced mower can bring a trouble-free season. As with all machines, the proper maintenance and set-up of your mower will give the best cut and less downtime, so that all silage and hay are cut on time. Proper mower maintenance also helps prevent unsafe situations during operation and extend the life of the machine. Here are some of the key checks that should performed prior to and during the cutting season. PTO Ensure all guards and chains are in place and in working order all along the drive line from the tractor to the gearbox or belts. This will safeguard all users and prevent hydraulic hoses and cable getting wrapped around the shaft. Don't forget to grease the universal joints, guards and shaft profile at regular intervals. Greasing points With various moving parts and pivot points, it is essential that these are greased and checked frequently to avoid early bushing and pin and bearing failure. By ensuring these are in good working order damage to other parts of the mower can be avoided. Stone guards and skids These are the components that make the contact with the ground. These are wearing parts that protect the mower bed from obstacles and expensive damage. Check these are fixed to the mower properly and for damage and wear. Oil levels and service Checking the oil level in the cutter-bar and the different gearboxes is important job, with low oils levels possibly indicating the presence of a leak. Oil quality and cleanliness should also be examined with oils services in line with the manufacturer's recommendations. The operator's manual is a good source of information to show where level should be checked throughout the machine. If a gyro gearbox is being used (now common on most trailed machines), a high oil level in the bottom gearbox is an indicator that seals have gone in the top gearbox - replace immediately. 80w90 is commonly used but check with operator's manual. When changing oil, inspect the magnet and look for metal filings. Check all vents on gearboxes, to be sure they are functioning correctly; if a vent is blocked, air cannot escape and oil seals will burst, and a damaged gearbox is the result. Too much oil in mower beds is worse than too little as this will cause the bed to overheat and seals to blow. So filling to the level is crucial. The vent at the top of the gearbox should be removed and checked to see it is letting air out correctly. Belts' condition and tension Depending on the mower type, the belts are often the components that deliver the power to the gearbox for the cutter bar or to the conditioner. The belts should be checked prior to mowing for condition and tension to prevent breakages or burn out during operation. Remember, belts should be replaced as a set, to ensure they all carry equal power. A worn or damaged drive pulley will not transmit equal drive across belts. Machine guards All machine guards should be in place to protect from moving parts and accidents. Remember, mower cover is the first line of defence from debris and obstacles thrown out by the cutting mechanism. Knives/blades condition Knife condition has the biggest influence on the cut and cut quality. Blunt or damaged knives tear rather than cut and also require more power to cut, so use more fuel. Knives should be checked daily and sharpened as required. Bent blades can also damage the machine. When buying new blades, bring the old ones to the store, to make sure you get the right parts. Blade holders will become worn as time passes; this will lead to loose blades and poor performance, and risk the bed becoming damaged. Cutting disc The components that turn at high speed should be inspected for wear and damage at regular intervals, when examining the knives. Also, the cutting disc should be checked to see if it is loose or if it has up-and-down movement, which indicates that a bearing is worn or needs replacing. Have a look at the condition of the top hats on the outer ends of the mower bed grease drop-down shaft, as it can often become seized and pull the top of the cutter bar. Also, the guards around the top hat disc are crucial as grass and dirt will become lodged in the hat, and at high rpm this will create an outof-balance motion, which will lead to bearings collapsing. Check for play between gears; if there is too much play, it means the gears are worn, and blades could start to clash against each other. Conditioner The conditioner should bruise grass to allow for better wilting. This part runs at a high rpm, so it is critical that it is functioning correctly. Conditioner tines/flails need to be checked for wear - a broken conditioner flail can cause the conditioner shaft to run out of balance, which will lead to cracked panels and vibration. Flail bushings and pins should be changed if they are worn. The tine holder may need to be re-welded and replaced if worn. The conditioner hood may also need to be replaced, as over time, with grass passing through, it will wear and become rotten. This is very important as it is what creates the level of grass bruising. Conditioner belts and pulleys should also be inspected - look at belts for cracks and pulleys for signs of tearing. All belt tension should be removed for winter as this prevents cracks occurring. Breakback In a mounted mower, the breakback protects the cutter bar if it meets a foreign object in the sward. Check that the spring tension is set correctly and make sure it is not seized. A seized breakback could lead to costly repairs if an object is hit. Hydraulic system Ensure that all hoses are in good condition, and are tidily secured by hose clamps or cable ties. Hydraulic rams should be inspected thoroughly, as leaking rams will cause trouble. If they are leaking, you can get replacement seals, and they are not too difficult to repair. Check the condition of the fold-out mechanism/ram if using a trailed mower - these rams have a habit of leaking internally, which is very dangerous as the mower will start to creep out on the road If you spot leaking, repair the seals and put an on-off tap on the hydraulic ram. Also inspect the condition of hydraulic fittings at the tractor. If leaking, replace. Wheels and tyres Check tyre pressures and inflate to correct pressure. Also check for perishing on tyres. Take a look at the rims, keeping an eye out for cracks The wheel bearings on trailed mowers often have grease points, and these are regularly neglected. Grease regularly, as wheel bearings can break; the hub often becomes damaged as well, which requires costly repairs. Flotation system Regardless of the type of mower you are operating, be it trailed or mounted, the cutter bed needs flotation so it can move away from stones in the field. Springs over time can become stretched and will not give sufficient flotation to the mowing bed. These should be replaced. A good test to see of the flotation is to fold out the mower and put in the cutting position. Can you lift the mower by hand from the ground? If not, adjustment is needed. If it lifts too easily, adjustment is also needed. A happy medium is where 5-10kg of lifting force is required. Cut height adjustment Ensure that the cut height adjustment mechanism is free and can be adjusted easily. If using a mounted mower, set the top link and lift the arms correctly to get the best cut. The drop arms of the lift should be level and top-link. When buying a new mower, read the manual to find out what the height lift should be set at - this will give the best performance for PTO joints and mowing in the fields. Slip clutches and over-run clutch The slip clutch is there to protect the mower when working in a heavy crop or if a collision occurs with a foreign object. Depending on the clutch, there are different settings. The over-run clutch protects the tractor's PTO band when the mower is stopped suddenly and allows the mower to come to a stop at a steady speed. It needs to be greased regularly.

Strangers, busy roads, internet stalkers. That's good, but what about embarrassing things like debt, bills and financial struggles? Frank Conway, financial adviser and founder of MoneyWhizz says we shouldn't. ""We must expose them. We have to give them habits early on to carry them through life. Money, like all resources is finite, it needs to be managed and it's our job to show how."" He reckons we can do this as soon as they learn to count. Age 3-7 Kids learn though play, so give them a range of small value coins. Activity: Price different toys with a bright sticker. Get them to 'pay' for each using coins and calculate simple change afterwards. Activity: Make up 20c or 50c using coins of different value. They learn one is not the same as the other. The value of the 'gold' coins is higher than the brown ones. Martina Hennessy, managing director of www.Doddl.ie says this approach ""may seem old fashioned"", but for younger children the money is a visual representation of the accumulation of cash. ""If younger children pay in cash they see the direct connection between spending and available funds."" In other words, when it's gone, it's gone. ""Go to the counter but let them pay with their own money, item in one hand, cash in the other. Which do they want more?"" Even very small kids can get involved in dayto-day spending decisions. ""Give children a budget and a section of your shopping list in the supermarket. Let them find and select a few items, comparing prices while sticking to the budget"", says Frank Conway. ""They'll learn quickly that one pizza is not priced the same as another. Why not? Can they get two if they shop carefully? What child isn't going to take up that offer!"" Martina Hennessy adds getting children to plan a meal for (EURO)10 is a great way of understanding how food is priced. Age 7-12 The pre-teen years are when children begin to separate needs from wants. Brands and advertising have an enormous impact, so the difference between cheap and expensive should be about value for money rather than cost. ""This is the time to get them to understand how to read a bank statement. The money in/ out principle,"" says Martina. ""We're all tapping our way through Covid. It's a great way to show, in print, where the spend is. Use a different highlighter marker for supermarkets, treats or clothes."" ""It's important to have conversations around security as well,"" says Conway. ""Nine- and 10-year-olds are very sharp, more so than many adults when it comes to online accounts and instant payments. They want to know can a bank see into your account? What is an IBAN code? How do you transfer money? ""Understanding receipts, tracking what you pay for, there's a risk they grow up thinking money isn't real or finite, nearly a play thing, a number on their phone - the phone is where their money comes from - there's elements of that. ""Payment for goods has changed fundamentally, so understanding in-app purchases and knowing if something looks free on the internet, is important."" Teens ""Teenagers are costly,"" says Martina Hennessy. ""Clothes, trainers, hoodies are all branded so while you can get away with cheaper brands for clothes for younger kids, budding teenagers are not so easy. They want phone credit, freedom to meet friends socially, school lunches in town as opposed to packed lunches. ""Many don't have the option of summer work, they're too young to babysit so offering household chores in return for a regular set amount of money and the responsibility of buying something they want is good money management."" She agrees it's a hard life lesson to discover you cannot always have everything you want. Continued on Page 36 Continued from Page 35 ""It's necessary to show children that sometimes you need to wait until you can afford it or accept it is not going to be possible. ""I have an eight-, six- and 10-year old who are money mad. I don't hold the purse strings. I say these are (EURO)30 and you only have (EURO)20, what are you going to do? Let them decide. ""They have so much, a toy room full of toys, shelves full of books. It's about holding back, do they really need this new thing?"" Making money as real as possible is important, she adds. ""Our children have grown up in the age of Netflix, Spotify, Deliveroo - instant gratification - so we need to show the balance between today and tomorrow; denying themselves something today so that they can save for something they really want."" Revolut revolution Like it or loathe it, over one million Irish customers of the online bank know it's handy. And in banking and finance, convenience often overrides cost. Hennessy set up a Revolut Junior account for her son, Alex, who turns 13 in September. ""Revolut offer one Junior account (age 6-17) including a prepaid card under their standard (free) package which means I can transfer money instantly to Alex and he can use it for contactless payments and cash withdrawals. ""I can track the spend, diary pocket money and freeze and unfreeze the account for online purchases and prevent contactless payments. ""I like the fact that I can set tasks for Alex and that he can set goals in relation to how he spends his pocket money which I send him weekly via the app."" Conway says parents might be astonished that their teens are 'investing' in cryptocurrencies at this age. ""There are 14-year-olds buying Bitcoin, becoming aware of all that. They're reading a lot more. I wouldn't discourage kids from doing that and if they lose their money, well then, let them."" If that sounds harsh, Conway says parents bailing out their kids every time teaches a poor message: there's always a safety net. ""Sometimes there isn't. Take the loss, it might instil a sense of fear, an awareness of doing due diligence. Perhaps some adults should have been taught that 20 years ago!"" He adds parents could agree a strategy with them, rather than forbidding or dismissing their financial choices, particularly when they themselves don't understand them. ""Gambling becomes a rolling amount and can be a danger,"" says Conway. ""Sit down with kids; give them a little budget, a goal to save safely, and a budget to do what they like with. They should know they could lose the lot. That's a lesson in itself. ""And if it encourages them to look up information about companies like Apple, Google and other publicly quoted companies, well and good."" Pocket money I always gave pocket money based on age. An eight-year-old gets (EURO)8, a 12-year old (EURO)12, etc. There has to be an incentive for getting older! You don't have to pay it weekly if it's too much; it's about habit and discipline. But - and here's the crux - in the same way your employer won't bail you out if you spend your entire salary the day you get it, you have to set boundaries around what they do with the money. They must put aside some, in an account or piggy bank for a future, named and timed, goal, eg a new phone at Christmas. You can further incentivise this by promising to make up the difference if they persist. Secondly, there's no overdraft. If they spend it all, you don't buy them stuff to fill the gap.

This follows a ruling by the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) that vaccination may be considered as a ""necessary safety measure"" in certain situations, including frontline health services.  On foot of the DPC ruling the HSE plans to write to staff indicating that it may seek information about their vaccination status as part of assessing risk to patients and other staff during the pandemic.  Where a risk is deemed to exist, the member of staff may be moved away from patient-facing duties, under the approach developed by the HSE.  It comes as the Government looks set to decide as early as today when indoor services will be allowed reopen in restaurants and pubs for people who have been vaccinated.  The Cabinet is set to hold an incorporeal meeting today to agree on plans for the reopening of these indoor services with a system to verify that customers have been vaccinated.   'Family bubble'  It is understood that a plan to allow children to accompany vaccinated parents into restaurants and pubs as part of a ""family bubble"" is included in the proposals.  It is expected that the European Union's digital Covid certificate for international travel will be adapted for use in the hospitality industry here at the doors of pubs or restaurants to prove vaccination or recent recovery from the virus.  The plans will also cover customers who were vaccinated in the North, Britain or the United States once they show evidence of this. Sources suggested that negative PCR and antigen tests could be used to gain access to indoor hospitality in later phases of the reopening but further scientific advice is needed as well as an examination of testing capacity for such measures to be introduced.  The date for indoor services to resume in restaurants and pubs is likely to be between July 19th and July 26th.  However, no final decision has been made on the date and it is not certain it will be set at today's Cabinet meeting. It is taking place to consider legislation that will have to be passed to provide the legal basis for the new system.  With the summer recess looming the Government aims to have the legislation passed in the Dáil and Seanad this week.  Restaurants Association of Ireland chief executive Adrian Cummins said they are within ""touching distance"" of an agreement which will allow for the opening of indoor hospitality.  Other plans to help cut the unemployment rate which has spiralled due to the pandemic will be unveiled by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys this morning. The Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025 will see the Government commit to slashing youth unemployment with the help of training incentives and subsidies to employers over the next two years. It includes a EUR 1,000 grant for people on unemployment payments to enter training in short-term accredited courses at a cost of EUR 11 million per year. Examples could include construction workers taking classes on driving heavy-goods vehicles. "

In comments likely to inflame tensions over the decision even further, Heather Humphreys revealed the annual cost to the State of each High Court judge is (EURO)370,000 in salaries, allowances and support staff. She also suggested that work practices and productivity in the courts is under scrutiny. Her remarks came in the wake of criticism from High Court President Mary Irvine. The senior judge requested between 15 and 20 additional judges earlier this year to deal with ""a tsunami"" of litigation once the Covid-19 crisis eases. However, legislation was passed allowing for just five extra judges. In an interview published yesterday, Ms Justice Irvine said she was left ""sort of speechless"" by the decision. The judge said the Government did not seem to appreciate how important timely access to justice is for citizens and businesses. Asked about the judge's remarks, the minister said: ""I want to assure you the Government is committed to ensuring the courts are adequately resourced to allow for the efficient administration of justice. ""That is why we passed legislation only this month to increase the number of High Court judges by five, and possibly six. That is one of the largest increases in judges in recent memory."" An ordinary judge of the High Court earns between (EURO)196,874 and (EURO)218,748 depending on when they were appointed and how long they have served. But Ms Humphreys said each High Court judge costs (EURO)370,000 a year when salary, allowances and support staff are taken into account. She described the decision to allow for five extra judges as ""a very significant investment by the State"". However, the minister declined to answer when asked if money was not available for the appointment of 20. Instead, she said a group involving representatives of the Government and the courts is considering the number and the types of judges required to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the coming years. ""The judicial planning working group will examine a range of issues, such as the number of High Court and other judges, as well as work practices and productivity in the court services,"" Ms Humphreys said. The group is due to report next spring. While a small number of senior judges have commented from the bench in recent years about a shortage of judges to hear cases, none have previously given an extensive interview on the matter. Ms Justice Irvine commented at length on the issue in an interview with solicitor Stuart Gilhooly SC in The Parchment, a magazine published by the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association. She said due to a shortage of judges, important planning cases would soon take up to a year to be heard, while the fast-track Commercial Court list was ""groaning"" with the number of matters awaiting trial dates. ""We are in a desperate scenario. We needed 12 judges three years ago. Now we need at least 17,"" Ms Justice Irvine said. Graphic   Minister Heather Humphreys"

England's wait will go on to at least 56 years as Italy seize the moment, and the game, to lift their second European Championship. That it was penalties, and the element that Gareth Southgate was supposed to address more than any other, only added to the anguish. That it was Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka only added to the unfairness of it in terms of emotion - not that Italy will see it like that. They more than deserved their win. The really big question that will at least go on until a trophy is finally won - and they will surely never get a better chance than this - is why Gareth Southgate's side so squandered the initiative; why a 1-0 lead was allowed to become 1-1 and then even worse. There are maybe bigger questions for the organisers of this tournament, given how shambolic - and downright dangerous - the circumstances at Wembley were. Supporters were told that ""hundreds, maybe over a thousand fans"" had got in without tickets, and that could be seen all around as fans crammed into spaces and in many places there were two a seat. It just meant that there were even more England fans there to witness this pain. The great homecoming ended up seeing a few home truths, as at least some of the remaining criticisms of Southgate were born out. His caution undid England here. The game - like the whole tournament - had fallen their way and was there to be won. So many advantages evaporated, right up to Luke Shaw's opening goal and that superb start. This shouldn't take away from Italy. The team of the tournament have ended up the most justified winners of the tournament, adding resilience and defiance to their list of qualities. They even had to endure the brilliant Federico Chiesa joining Leonardo Spinazzola on the bench. They also had to endure a dismal opening, and what seemed a sure sign the home team would at last take glory. The opening goal wasn't just a moment of deafening celebration, but seemed one of definitive vindication. Southgate had immediate pay-off for another tactical decision. It wasn't just that one wing-back scored, but that the other set it up. Neither Shaw nor Kieran Trippier would probably have been in these positions in quite the same way if Southgate had gone with a back four, but they were here just punishing Italy. Force The force of Shaw's finish was almost a distillation of the conviction in England's game. Trippier floated it over a paralysed Italian defence, and Shaw just followed through with his run to drive it past Gianluigi Donnarumma. Roberto Mancini's side were badly missing Spinazzola given how he would have pinned Trippier back, but that wasn't all they were missing. They were also missing coherence, speed, sharpness and any attacking threat. It was like they didn't know how to stop England coming at them, and couldn't figure out how to get behind them. In one stoppage, Mancini could be seen manically gesticulating at Chiesa. The truth was that the Juventus forward was the only player offering any real threat and eventually turned the game, which made it all the more cruel when he was forced off before the end through injury. Italy had lost their two best players for the climax. There were times here when Chiesa had to do it all himself. He was the source of Italy's most dangerous moment of the first half, as he broke from deep to shoot narrowly wide, but that was part of the problem. For the second, he at least managed to work his way into England's box but Jordan Pickford palmed it away. It was a rare foray that far. Italy were reduced to speculative long shots by the half-hour. The great wonder was why England didn't build on that at the time. They seemed content to sit and try and contain Italy through shape alone. It is remarkable given Southgate himself had spoken against this, and been so conscious of precisely these situations. It, of course, had the effect of urging Italy on and rewarding them with the initiative. Italy, for their part, more than took charge. Marco Verratti began to take control of the game rather than just taking control of the ball for aimless possession. There was purpose now. Chiesa, of course, signalled that with one purposeful run this time into the English box that brought a fine save out of Pickford. That was when it really started to run. It was as if Italy in that moment realised a vulnerability in England. Pickford wasn't so sharp for the equaliser, but then no one in the England backline was. A team so good at the basics for so much of this tournament completely failed to deal with a corner, allowing Verratti to force Pickford into a meek save off the post before Leonardo Bonucci drove in the loose ball. Substitutes inevitably saw the game swing again, as Southgate once more used England's array of attacking options to effect, but there was also one that wasn't expected. The brilliant Chiesa had to go off, removing so much of Italy's thrust. It was now Italy's turn to stifle England. The prospect of penalties weighed over the game. The players ended up feeling the immense pressure, worse than any other. Andrea Belotti was the first to buckle. Rashford followed with a run-up that betrayed his anxiety. Sancho stuttered too. Jorginho had the chance to win it. Even he missed. Poor Saka had a reprieve. There was no relief. It's another oh so near - closer than ever before, and yet even further away.

The Manchester United striker was brought on in the last minute of extra time to take a spot kick, but his effort clipped the outside of a post. Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka then saw their efforts saved as Italy won the shootout 3-2, after which all three players suffered vile racist taunts on social media. The players and head coach Gareth Southgate rallied around the trio yesterday, with Southgate labelling the abuse 'unforgivable' and captain Harry Kane telling the bigots: 'We don't want you.' A mural of Rashford in Greater Manchester was defaced in the hours following the final, but locals responded by covering the graffiti with messages of support for the striker. In a statement on Twitter last night, Rashford, 23, said: 'I don't even know how to put into words how I'm feeling at this exact time. I've had a difficult season and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. 'I've always backed myself for a penalty but something didn't feel quite right.

'I can take critique of my per- formance all day long, my penalty was not good enough. But I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. I've felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of 10s of thousands. 'The messages I've received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. 'I'm Marcus Rashford, 23-yearold black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, south Manchester.

'We've been a beacon of light in bringing people together and people being able to relate to the national team. 'We've shown the power our country has when it does come together.' Kane joined the condemnation last night, tweeting: 'Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up and take a pen when the stakes were high. They deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night. 'If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you.'

During the first six months of this year, the IDA said 142 investments were agreed with a total employment potential for over 12,530 jobs, up from the 9,600 potential jobs in the first half of 2020. ""These very strong results show that foreign direct investment continued to grow, demonstrating further endurance and strength even as the pandemic entered a second year,"" IDA CEO Martin Shanahan said yesterday. The IDA's first-half numbers were published amid a global push for heavier taxes on multinational companies that represents the biggest ever threat to Ireland's low tax, foreign investment-driven growth model that has underwritten the economy here. At the same time as the IDA published its results showing there had been deals with 62 new investors and 80 established companies, Europe's finance ministers, led by Ireland's Paschal Donohoe, met with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to thrash out the terms of a new global tax code. Minister Donohoe has refused to endorse all elements of the global tax deal and Ireland appeared to have scored a victory as the EU abandoned its digital tax plans which would have hit the tech companies that are major investors here hard. The IDA said the push for an international tax deal ""underlines the need to ensure that each component part of Ireland's value proposition remains competitive"". IDA clients ""continue to have significant confidence in Ireland, that is down to the stability of the taxation regime and rate over many years. That is why we continue to see the big numbers in 2020 that we saw, and the numbers now in the first half of 2021,"" Mr Shanahan said. ""It is perfectly legitimate Ireland would articulate Ireland's (corporation tax) case… Remaining stable and competitive is where we need to be,"" he said. Ireland's 12.5pc corporation tax rate is under threat from plans for a 15pc minimum rate that would reduce the attractiveness of the State as an investment destination. The EU needs Ireland and two other holdouts to sign up for any tax deal as the issue requires unanimity among member states. Mr Shanahan said Ireland would also continue to welcome investment from China which he said was mostly in 'greenfield' sites. ""China is a huge market,"" he said, noting that the country is part of the Asia-Pacific region ""that IDA plans to continue to grow investment from"". Chinese investment in the EU has come under scrutiny due to concerns over human rights. There are also concerns that China is cherry-picking some of Europe's top companies in order to transfer technologies to its own firms. Despite concerns that Brexit has caused interruptions to trade and the recent loss of hundreds of jobs in a reorganisation by Deutsche Bank, Mr Shanahan said Ireland was benefitting from Britain's decision to leave the EU.

There is a growing number of people in Ireland who have built up businesses worth tens of millions of euro. Hopefully, that will continue. Because when it comes to the rich, it really is a case that even if you think you can't live with them, you probably also can't live without them. Earlier this week I was asked on radio about Ireland's Rich List, the TV programme I presented for RTÉ television. ""How do you think a person who has lost their job because of Covid will feel sitting at home watching a TV programme about the richest people in the country?"" the presenter asked. It is a fair question, especially given that so many people have lost so much during the pandemic. I have always been uncomfortable with the idea of admiring anyone because they are rich. But I don't believe in disrespecting someone simply because they are rich either. It is always about who they are and what they have done. If the economy is going to emerge well from the ravages of Covid, we are going to need those very same entrepreneurs to create the jobs that will hopefully get more people back to work. The rich list in Ireland is different, as is our attitude to the wealthiest people in our society. A US or UK list has a significant number of super-rich celebrity multi-billionaires like Richard Branson, Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. Our group of very wealthy people has a handful of billionaires, a handful of people with inherited wealth and a large number of selfmade multi-millionaires, many of whom came from relatively modest backgrounds. In Ireland we are fascinated by the wealthiest, partly because there is a reasonable chance we know someone who knows them, or we sat beside one of them in school. Attitudes to entrepreneurship and wealth creation really began to change here in the 1990s. And they have been twisting and turning ever since. Before that we held a deep suspicion of the ""businessman"". He (usually a man) was seen as a jumped-up Del Boy, probably on the make, probably dodging tax and breaking, or at least bending, the rules wherever he could. Some of that suspicion was even borne out during the Tribunals of Inquiry of that era. Businesspeople themselves often despaired at being tarred with the same brush and would regularly complain about begrudgery, which showed itself in political policy as well as down the local pub. One of Ireland's richest business figures, who lives on a big country estate, told me how he still goes to the local pub, but always leaves before 9.30pm. ""Before 9.30pm, you are a great local fella who did well for himself. After about 10.30pm, you are a rich b***ox who was always a complete a***hole."" The old suspicion of business changed as the Irish economy took off during the early Celtic Tiger years. There was a growing, if at times reluctant, acceptance that decent people could develop an idea into a very successful business that would create jobs, as well as wealth for those behind it. When the Celtic Tiger collapsed in an orgy of debt-fuelled unproductive property speculation, the dial was reset on wealth creation and wealth suspicion. Public shows of ostentation were out. During the worst days and financial pain of the crash, you could even hear people in conversation believing they had to explain themselves if they were splashing out on a foreign holiday. The rebound of the Irish economy after the crash came more swiftly than many imagined. With it came a real recognition that we couldn't rely simply on property speculation or foreign multi-nationals to create sustainable jobs. Irish people are more comfortable with acknowledging the achievements of a successful entrepreneur as long as they don't brag about it. One of the biggest changes after the crash has been the attitude towards public displays of wealth. In the boom years, the bigger the Italian kitchen, the home swimming pool or the sports car, the better. The rich in Ireland still enjoy spending their money but they are much more reticent about it - bragging about being filthy rich is very Noughties. The last five years have seen the creation of more genuine wealth in Ireland than the decade that followed the millennium year. The Collison brothers behind Stripe have helped to create $100bn ((EURO)84bn) worth of value in their business and they are still only aged 30 and 32. There will always be high-profile business collapses but our successful businesses have broken the cycle of the imploding Irish entrepreneur. In 1998, the late UCC professor Edward Cahill wrote a fascinating book called Corporate Financial Crisis in Ireland. In it he backed up his central thesis that successful Irish entrepreneurs tended to financially implode, by using examples from Larry Goodman and Kentz Group, to Cambridge Group and Tony Ryan's GPA. Goodman would of course recover, and Tony Ryan's Ryanair eventually took off, even if GPA did not. Ireland now has a growing number of businesspeople who have built real long-term sustainable wealth. They have got better at moving beyond boom to bust. With this new wealth come bigger questions about the growing gap between the rich and the middle class, never mind the chasm between the richest and poorest. Born out of the implosion of the American dream as real wages for most US workers have barely budged in decades, the challenge of tackling wealth inequality needs to be addressed. Incentivising business investment, where people and money can relocate so easily, has to be balanced with making sure the top 1pc pay their way when it comes to taxation. Meanwhile, we need more people who are willing and able to build successful international businesses from Ireland. Part two of Ireland's Rich List is on RTÉ 1 at 9.35pm on Monday.

Belarus's exiled opposition leader first visited Roscrea as a 12-year-old in 1994, through a project to help children from areas affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster; it was also the year that Alexander Lukashenko became president of her country.  Tikhanovskaya would visit Co Tipperary twice more, then study to be a teacher, work as a translator and a secretary, marry and have two children. Much in her life has changed over the past 27 years, during which Belarus's western neighbours have modernised and joined the EU, but Lukashenko is still in power, his country has stagnated, and his rule has become more autocratic. Tikhanovskaya says those summers in Ireland showed her that life did not have to be the often demeaning struggle that it was for many Belarusians - and recent events have only made it much worse for thousands of her compatriots. When Lukashenko launched the most brutal crackdown of his reign last year, 35,000 people were detained for attending peaceful rallies. Rights groups say Belarus is still detaining more than 500 political prisoners - including Tikhanovskaya's husband, Sergei - and the regime has shown its readiness to go to extraordinary lengths to punish its enemies, even using a fake bomb threat to divert a Ryanair jet to Minsk in May so that activist Roman Protasevich could be taken off the airliner and arrested.  Tikhanovskaya hopes the Government and Ryanair will support international legal action against Belarus over the Protasevich incident, and that officials will reiterate Ireland's backing for economic sanctions against the regime and for a push to free political prisoners. Doing so would add substance to often-vapid talk of defending the ""European values"". At the same time, this State should signal its readiness to play a full part in EU efforts to help other ex-Soviet states such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova develop the kind of independent institutions and rule of law that are anathema to Lukashenko and his ilk."

The chaos off the park created by imperfect organisation was eventually overshadowed by compelling drama on the pitch. It wasn't a vintage final, but there was always a niggling sense that it might go the distance because of how the past month has played out. The twists and turns of the shootout took the tension to an unbelievable level. There's been nothing especially straightforward about the staging of this renewal. The fact that Euro 2020 took place in 2021 is the easiest illustration of that. Throw in the proliferation of host venues and how luck of the draw effectively sent Baku bound teams to another continent and the flaws were so clear and obvious that VAR wasn't needed. And yet, somehow, we still ended up with arguably the best international competition in recent memory, a roller-coaster of emotions that only really took a breath on the rest days. Diluted You probably haven't read or heard much over the past week about how the 24-team tournament has diluted the entertainment value. If anything, it introduced a wildcard aspect to the beginning of the knockout stages that steadily built the momentum and excitement. A penalty shootout conclusion delivered the Hollywood style ending, with Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling playing as wing backs in the dying stages a surreal preparation for what would follow. The idea that Jordan Pickford would save a Jorginho penalty at the peak of the competition and still end up on the losing side just about sums up the unscripted madness of it all. And for all that Ireland's relationship with England is complicated, and the outcome will have prompted celebrations in most parts of this island, it seemed cruel that Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka and particularly Marcus Rashford ended up being the fall guys. England's home advantage hung over every aspect of this final, and the hangover may have implications for their staging of future competitions. Ireland are a part of the 2030 World Cup bid which is being driven by the English FA, but they may face a diplomatic challenge in the aftermath of the evening with anecdotal tales of fans gaining access without tickets and clear and visible footage of fights in and outside the stadium. That story will run in the background of the aftermath and while attending an event of that magnitude is a privilege, it didn't turn out that way for everyone present. But in the main, this was a made for TV tournament as opposed to a spectator friendly exercise, save for the chosen nations able to benefit from their own fans backing them. UEFA's current hierarchy inherited the mileage heavy format from Michel Platini and have ruled out going down this route again. Nevertheless, while the festival atmosphere fusing fans from a mix of nations was absent - with circumstances instead allowing the fervour of supporters in countries with a more relaxed Covid attitude to dominate - the football created the most memorable images. It has become fashionable to bash international football and it's true that the breaks that interrupt the rhythm of the club season can be enervating. Then again, that Anglocentric view is often driven from the sense of formality that hangs over their qualification for major tournaments. Scenes such as the Scottish celebrations when they booked their passage last November showed the magic that can be generated by trying to get there. We know that very well in these parts too, even if recent years have brought only agony and frustration. But this competition provided the evidence that the slog is worth it. There's a certain authenticity about the sharp end of international tournaments which is on another level to the high end club competitions. Perhaps that's because those events consume a base of supporters who know deep down that the players they are watching will come and go and may soon leave for a better offer. Gone are the days when players need the financial rewards from their international representation. This really is all about the glory. Lionel Messi centred celebrations after Argentina's Copa America joy in the early hours of Sunday morning provided a reminder of that. The deeper meaning of international activity is created by the fact that success cannot be bought, much as the bigger and wealthier football nations will always have a greater chance of success. England's rise has been fuelled by a belated channelling of their power in a coherent direction. But there is no transfer market to cure issues in a particular area (the temptation for another Declan Rice reference will be shunned on this occasion; Italy have used rules to their advantage too) so managers largely have to work with the hand they've been given. The sides that reached the business end appeared to share a unity that has arguably eluded more talented groups. Progression Denmark didn't make it all the way, but their progression was also characterised by factors that allowed them to exceed the sum of the parts. Under Gareth Southgate, England's players genuinely seem to enjoy each other's company. Conor Coady didn't see a minute's action in the finals but told a Sky reporter beforehand that he'd enjoyed the best six weeks of his life. Footballers can trot out those lines, of course, but there really doesn't appear to be anything forced about the English harmony. Italy have managed to present that image across the piece too, especially when adversity hit their ranks and took out Leonardo Spinazzola, a shining light in their rise. They were flummoxed again last night when Federico Chiesa was forced to hobble off, a blow that seemed to take the wind out of their sails. But the sight of Giorgio Chiellini attempting to overlap in the 122nd minute showed the eyes remained fixed on the prize. Under stifling pressure, however, they held their nerve the better to ensure that the coveted trophy would take flight. Graphic   Luke Shaw celebrates after scoring England's early opener"

Ireland probably would have been better off economically as part of the UK up to the 1960s as the Irish Government made ""some bad policy decisions"" in the first few decades of its independence, according to John Fitzgerald, research affiliate with the ESRI and adjunct professor with Trinity College Dublin. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Irish trade and industry policies were largely built around protectionism and self-sufficiency. These policies failed to deliver growth - and led to unemployment and emigration. ""We did not adopt free trade when the rest of Europe did,"" said Fitzgerald. ""Ireland and Northern Ireland had a miserable 1920s and 1930s, up to World War Two. There was a dramatic increase in our standard of living after joining the EU and with the free trade that came with that."" One of the most valuable things about Irish independence was the flexibility which it gave the Irish government to adapt and make its own decisions, according to Eoin McLaughlin of University College Cork. ""The 1920s was an unstable period: the global economy was very unstable after World War One and then you had the Great Depression,"" said McLaughlin. ""The flexibility to make our own decisions proved useful as time went on - rather than immediately after independence. It proved very important when we joined the EU."" DID IRISH WOMEN WORK AFTER INDEPENDENCE? In 1922, the Irish Free State reduced the voting age for women from 30 to 21, bringing it in line with the voting age for men. Although this extension of the voting age was a positive for women's equality, in the early 1930s, Ireland introduced a marriage ban which forced women in the public service to give up work when they got married. This ban remained in Ireland until 1973, though it was lifted for teachers in the 1950s. Marriage bans were common throughout Europe and the US at the time although Ireland was one of the last to lift its bar. ""Going back to the 1930s, women were better educated than men so it was a huge loss to the economy that many women weren't working,"" said Fitzgerald. Women bore much of the responsiblity for housework and childcare. Without the conveniences of electricity, running water and modern appliances, housework was a much more gruelling task back then than it is today. Many women worked on family farms in the early decades of independence, often looking after small livestock such as poultry, pigs and calves, as well as the vegetable garden. Women's participation in the workforce has much improved since the 1920s and 1930s. Almost 80pc of Irish women between the ages of 25 and 54 are now in the workforce, although this is still slightly below the EU average. The high cost of childcare in Ireland today however is a huge challenge for many parents and often acts as a disincentive to employment for many women. Working women are also more likely than men to be in part-time roles."

Indians have flocked to popular mountain retreats such as Shimla, Manali and Mussoorie in recent weeks to escape the searing summer heat and make the most of a recent decline in the country's coronavirus caseload, following a devastating second wave of the virus this year. Much of the country, including tourism-dependent mountain states, are reopening, and local authorities have encouraged domestic travel in the hope of limiting the severe economic blow of extended lockdowns. But officials, who have warned that India could face a third wave in the coming months, said crowds of tourists could endanger that hard-won reprieve as parts of the country continued to battle high Covid positivity rates and increasing transmission. Disregard  India's home ministry raised the alarm on Saturday about ""blatant disregard of Covid-appropriate behaviour in hill stations and other tourist locations"". VK Paul, the head of India's Covid-19 task force, said on Friday that there was ""a new risk emerging"" from the flurry of tourist activity. At the height of the second wave in May, India recorded more than 400,000 infections and 4,000 deaths a day - both figures believed to be vast undercounts - in a brutal surge that overwhelmed health systems. Prime minister Narendra Modi's government, which faced fierce criticism for complacency and for failing to avert the onslaught, has sought to assure the public that it is preparing for a possible resurgence in cases. While the official daily case tally has fallen to about 40,000, parts of India are battling renewed transmission. Maharashtra, India's richest state and home to the financial capital Mumbai, has reimposed some lockdown measures, while the southern state of Kerala has registered a rising number of cases. Maskless crowds The home ministry said the rate of positive tests in parts of states including West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh  - all of which are home to popular mountain retreats - have exceeded its threshold of 10 per cent. Images of maskless crowds thronging scenic spots and congested mountain roads have prompted dismay. Police said they had turned back 2,000 cars en route to Mussoorie, a tourist destination in Uttarakhand, according to the Hindustan Times. India's tourism industry is nearing disaster, however, with international tourists in effect barred from the country since the start of the pandemic. The government announced several relief measures last month, including loans to tourist guides and businesses, many of whom are facing financial ruin. Experts said the dangers of a third wave were being exacerbated by the sluggish pace of vaccinations, with India continuing to face a shortage of jabs. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021"

The Financial Times reports that the group's chief executive, Pat Gelsinger, recently met French president Emmanuel Macron and Italian prime minister Mario Draghi to discuss the global chip shortage that has hit industries around the globe. Mr Gelsinger's visit followed signals from the European Union that substantial sums could be made available to help the bloc meet a new target to double semiconductor production to 20 per cent of the global market by 2030, including making the most advanced chips. Intel is investing $20 billion in two new factories in the US and a further $7 billion (EUR 5.9 billion) to double the capacity of its Leixlip plant in Co Kildare, as part of a multiyear strategy to catch up with semiconductor giants TSMC and Samsung, the Financial Times reports. The chipmaker is also planning to bring its most advanced 7 nanometre (nm) chip production to its Leixlip site.  'EU-wide benefits' Its executives suggested there could be ""EU-wide benefits"" if the company's requirements for a new European fabrication plant were met, raising the possibility of spreading the facilities and services to support chip production across the EU.  Greg Slater, Intel vice-president of global regulatory affairs, who is part of the team exploring possibilities for expansion in Europe told the Financial Times, ""We could put manufacturing on one site and packaging on another."" Research and development could also be shared across EU countries, while spending with European suppliers would increase ""dramatically"". He said the company is ""well placed to make this an ecosystem-wide project, not just a couple of isolated paths in one member state. We do believe that this is a project that will benefit Europe at large"". As well as financial support, the Financial Times reports Intel is looking for a site of about 405 hectares (1,000 acres) with developed infrastructure, with capabilities to support up to eight chip fabrication facilities, known as fabs, and which has access to talent. Germany, the Netherlands, France and Belgium are among the countries Intel is exploring for a potential factory and a decision is expected by the end of the year.  Two fabs Mr Slater said that initially two fabs would be established at a total cost of some $20 billion for 10 years of operation. Over the lifetime of the plant, total investment could top $100 billion (EUR 84 billion), Intel has said.  French officials said Intel was looking at bringing fairly advanced 10nm chip technology, or better, to Europe. Discussions continued over whether this would suit the needs of European customers, who currently rely on more mature technologies. ""It takes a lot of money to position yourself to go on the most advanced technologies,"" an official told the Financial Times. ""We are looking at what is feasible and what is desirable."" State aid will be crucial to ensuring the factory's competitiveness. ""The cost disadvantage is 30 to 40 per cent with Asia and a lot of that is due to government support,"" Mr Slater said. However, Intel was not just looking for a handout, French officials said. ""They are looking at the ecosystem, the location of the site. It's not just a question of what the states will give them in terms of money. It's a complex set of factors."""

The group's submission, which is published today, calls on the Government to meet its commitment to that effect in the national early years strategy, First 5. It says the Government must begin to meet the target by increasing funding and announcing the plan on how it will achieve that over the following six years.  Early Childhood Ireland supports 3,800 childcare members nationwide, who - in turn - support more than 120,000 children and their families.  Frances Byrne, director of policy with Early Childhood Ireland, said: ""We are calling on the Government to take real and immediate action to increase public investment in childcare.  ""The Government has committed to reforming and investing in childcare, yet in Budget 2021, despite significant investment in other essential services, childcare funding was not increased.  ""We are still without a plan or proposal for adequate funding our sector. Families are poorly served and have waited too long.  ""Ireland has consistently remained at the bottom of the class when it comes to investment in childcare.  ""According to the OECD, we invest the least amount in early years of any developed country as a percentage of GDP.""  Double funding Ms Byrne said the call for the Government to double its funding is based on 2018 expenditure which stood close to EUR 485million, and so funding of EUR 970 million would be required by 2028.  Ms Byrne said the lack of investment ""costs us all"", and that parents pay the highest childcare fees from take-home pay in the European Union. Average fees for full-time childcare is EUR 186.12 per week, according to a recent report by Government-funded organisation Pobal. The cost of childcare in other EU countries is substantially less.

191,191,/home/paultrust/Downloads/Files(415)/Ireland 'bottom of class' for childcare funding.DOCX,The Irish Times,2021-07-10,1108 words,WEEKEND; Pg. 5,David McWilliams,NA,Ireland a tax haven? I don't think so,FALSE,"In January 1988, the Economist magazine carried a special report on Ireland entitled, ""The poorest of the rich"". Our economy was in a tailspin. Emigration was skyrocketing, we had just devalued the currency for the fourth time in a decade and the country was flirting with a debt crisis.  Capital and talent continued to flow out of the country, leaving a fragile shell of vulnerable local companies and a bloated public service, undermined by a current account deficit. In short, a basket case.  Today, 35 years later, the country is unrecognisable.  The scale of Ireland's transformation since that Economist article is captured in the UN's human development index which measures achievement along three basic measurements of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living.  In June 1990, as David O'Leary sent the Romanian keeper the wrong way in Genoa, Ireland was in 23rd place; by 2019, we had jumped to second place, just behind the Norwegians. In 1990, Ireland ranked just behind Slovenia, the alpine republic that at the time was trying to wriggle its way out of a dissolving Yugoslavia. Slovenia has been one of the more successful former socialist countries in central Europe, more Switzerland than Serbia. Yet Slovenia remains in the same place, ranked 22nd in 2019, underscoring the extraordinary propulsion of Ireland.  Sometimes people who live in revolutionary times do not appreciate the extent of the changes going on around them, Irish people included. The evolution of the Irish economy and society since the Berlin Wall fell and the world embraced globalisation has been truly astonishing.  Internal dynamo  The Irish ""trick"" was to appreciate that small countries - in a globalised world - need to become a cog in the global supply chain. Small countries have always been hamstrung by the tyranny of size. We must trade our way to prosperity. Our local market is too small to generate an internal dynamo and therefore hitching a ride on someone else's wagon is the name of the game. It is beyond doubt that entry of multinational companies here allowed us to achieve this take-off velocity.  In the late 1980s, Ireland was thwarted by a lack of capital. When you have no capital of your own, you must import it and you do this by making capital cheap. How do you make the deployment of capital cheaper in your country? You tax it less.  Tax is an entirely legitimate weapon in a sovereign country's economic arsenal. It will always be the case. As we begin to frame a discussion about the role of multinational companies here, it would be wise to take stock and - honestly and without rancour - appreciate the vital part that foreign companies, attracted by our tax system among other things, have played in our country's transformation.  Here are a few figures to think about.  According to the IDA, direct employment at multinational companies rose to an all-time high of 257,394 in 2020, accounting for 12.4 per cent of all (Covid-adjusted) employment. This represents an increase of slightly under 80 per cent relative to the 144,815 employees in 2010. Some 20,000 new jobs have been created in the multinational sector over the course of the last year.  The multiplier in the economy is also highly significant. It is estimated that eight other jobs are created in the wider economy for every 10 in IDA client companies. If we use these calculations, total employment of 463,309 stems from these multinationals' presence in the economy.  The amount of wages generated by the multinational sector was EUR 15.1 billion in 2020, up 11.3 per cent on the year. Extra spending on Irish materials (EUR 2.7 billion) and services (EUR 7.4 billion) contributed to the EUR 25.2 billion aggregate wages and expenditure by these firms in the Irish economy in the same period. In terms of specific major companies, the following figures give us a sense of what is going on. Apple: 6,000 employees; Google: 7,000 employees; Facebook: 6,000 employees; Pfizer: 4,000 employees; Microsoft: 2,700 employees.  Are you beginning to get the picture?  On Thursday, the New York Times described Ireland as a tax haven but if this means a place where companies have a fictitious presence with little or no real impact in the greater society, that is not true because our globalised economy is fuelled by multinational corporations and we are all better off as a result.  Let's look at tax revenue. In 2020, corporation tax from multinational companies stood at EUR 11.8 billion which accounted for about 21 per cent of total receipts collected last year, the third-largest source of tax revenue behind income tax (EUR 22.7 billion or about 40 per cent) and VAT (EUR 12.4 billion or about 22 per cent) receipts.  Roots  It is also the only source of tax that is rising. The 10 largest corporation taxpayers paid a record-high net EUR 5.98 billion (or 51 per cent of the aggregate) in 2020. This is just under a 345 per cent increase on the EUR 1.35 billion collected in 2009, when the 10 largest payers accounted for just 35 per cent of total receipts. The 100 largest companies account for just under 80 per cent of all corporation tax receipts. These tax receipts pay for hospitals, schools, vaccines, surgeries, welfare payments and a whole host of other essential services that maintain Ireland's position on the UN's human development league. As the country tries to navigate changes in global tax systems, we should not forget this. Ireland would be much poorer and immeasurably more fragile were it not for our corporation tax regime. It might not appeal to everyone, but the alternative - an Ireland without multinationals - is not worth contemplating. Ultimately, I believe the roots of multinationals in Ireland are deep and the relationship is mutually beneficial. They are not about to up sticks and leave, even with some degree of tax harmonisation. We are an indispensable cog in the global supply chain and ultimately capital will, like water, flow on the path of least resistance.  The data of tax receipts, jobs, spin-off companies and capital transfers speaks for itself. Ireland is not a tax haven, otherwise none of the real benefits that have changed the lives of millions of Irish people would have accrued over the past three decades. This is our strategic model. It has worked spectacularly well. Granted, we need to fix more, but we fix the country with money, not slogans.  Our national transformation as measured not only by income but by the UN's own development index has been aided immeasurably by large foreign companies and we would be wise to remember that when we start a new national conversation.

Black Hole, Green Card was the first of his books I read around the mid-1990s and I still have my well-thumbed volume and almost all his subsequent works. His books will still be read in 20 years' time and beyond to get a perspective on Ireland that is sometimes arguable, occasionally uncomfortable and always insightful.  O'Toole's opinion pieces are like that too, which is what makes them essential reading. Often I agree with them (more so as I get older) but sometimes I disagree violently - however, as a reader, that is what you want. For me, though, his piece in last Tuesday's Irish Times ,""Ireland is both immoral and stupid on corporate tax"", was a damning conclusion based on a false understanding. At one level he's right. What is the Government doing? Why would Ireland want to be on a list of nine countries (some of which you'd struggle to find on a map) that didn't sign up to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's grand plan for changing the global tax landscape? Never mind the details, in the court of public opinion and newspaper headlines Ireland has been tried and convicted. It's an awful look.  Headlines are perhaps all that matter these days; however, I believe that facts and detail should matter, particularly in today's world. Why would OECD secretary general Mathias Cormann issue a positive and supportive tweet about Minister for Finance Paschal Donohue and the Government when the agreement was signed? Why are other finance ministers not queuing up to give Ireland a lash? The bottom line is that Ireland's position on tax and our place in the world in the global tax debate has shifted massively over the last eight years - something which is not recognised in some quarters. The Apple case, even though it went much further back in time, didn't help (although in the interests of accuracy, the European Commission's position that Ireland gave an illegal tax deal was roundly routed by the General Court in Luxembourg). For those shouting ""What about Ireland helping US companies avoid tax?"", that's an old, no longer relevant argument made redundant by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 which now taxes the worldwide profits of US companies. When you get into the detail, Ireland has proactively and voluntarily signed up to quite a lot.  Global rules The main thrust of the negotiations over the last eight years (known as Pillar 1) is to change the global rules that have operated for  more than a century. Generally a company pays tax where its activities, risks, assets and people are located. In future they will pay some tax in the countries into which they sell, even if they have no physical presence there.  This was part of the global recognition that the tax rules for cross-border commerce, formulated in the aftermath of the first World War, needed to be modernised. This will cost Ireland about EUR 2 billion per annum - about a sixth of our corporate tax take. No dragging of feet by Ireland here and our engagement in this process was evident for everyone to see.What has emerged more recently is a push for a global minimum tax rate, known as Pillar 2. Ireland has actually signed up to the principle of this. Until earlier this year it seemed as if everyone was converging on that being 12.5 per cent, which would have suited Ireland perfectly.  The Biden administration is suggesting 15 per cent, which causes Ireland a problem. As O'Toole said, ""companies value predictability"", and for all of this century we've given local and foreign companies that predictability around 12.5 per cent. Other countries have been more blatant about protecting their national interests, with the UK, for example, leading the charge on getting the financial services industry excluded from the new global rules.  There is no mathematical magic around the number of 12.5 per cent. It could be 11 per cent - or even 15 per cent. But in the ongoing battle to attract inward investment into an island on the periphery of Europe, the unchanging rate is a symbol of certainty and predictability. Based on my 35 years working with US companies setting up in Ireland, that has a real value. O'Toole is also right that Ireland will almost certainly sign up to an OECD agreement in full by the year end which will, in all likelihood, include a minimum rate of tax. So why doesn't Ireland just go with the flow? And therein lies the rub. Given the US congressional arithmetic, it is far from certain that the Biden administration will be able to deliver domestically on its minimum tax proposals. If that turns out to be the case, the debate could end up back where it started - at 12.5 per cent. So given 12.5 per cent has worked well for Ireland over the last 20 years or more, why wouldn't Ireland wait the six months to see? After all, as the chestnut goes, we've agreed the principle and now we're just haggling over the price.  Inward investment Lest anyone think I believe Ireland should die in the ditch for 12.5 per cent, not at all. Firstly, if the US passes domestic legislation to encompass all of the Biden administration's intent,  it wouldn't be economically rational, quite aside from the optics, for us to continue to hold on to 12.5 per cent.  Secondly, Ireland's attractiveness to inward investment isn't all about the tax and it hasn't been for a very long time.  So if the proposition is that we should give up something of proven value where it is uncertain as to whether we need to, then I think it's the right strategy to wait six months to be sure.  The global tax rules have been changing in the last few years and Ireland's rules have changed with them. More change will come but accusations these days of Ireland being the bad boys of the tax world are neither fair nor accurate. Feargal O'Rourke is managing partner of PwC"

With four minutes remaining, Ireland had just been pegged back to 24-all, having lost to Wales and France before beating Italy. A ho-hum season was shaping into a decidedly ho-hum Six Nations. Thankfully Johnny Sexton landed the difficult 77th minute penalty to seal a win, whereupon Ireland saved their best 'til last when England came calling a week later. Roll on a two-game series at home against Japan and the USA, and Ireland have rounded off the season with five successive wins. They have averaged almost 40 points per match and scored 24 tries in those five games, albeit conceding 11 tries, which is a mite too many. True, four of those five games have been at home and 15 of those tries came against Italy and the USA. Even so, considering the flak which was coming the way of the coaches and team, and would have continued to do so had Sexton not landed that late penalty in Murrayfield, it's been a strong end to the season. With the All Blacks the opposition on four occasions next season, when Ireland will play another dozen matches, that's no harm. In time, to overcome such a brilliantly inventive and skilful side as Japan without 10 of the starting line-up from the win over England will be viewed as a good performance.  It's one of the curiosities of emphatic, clinical wins such as the 71-10 dissection of a porous USA last Saturday that despite overcoming a rickety start before then putting together some thrilling spells of rugby, the more a superior team ruthlessly pulls away, the more it almost seems to devalue the scale of the win.  Granted, the skillset of the two teams underlined the vast gulf between the Pro14 and Major League Rugby, and the Eagles had only come together for the first time in 21 months last Wednesday week. Their huge effort against England at Twickenham seemed to leave them drained too. Experience By contrast, Andy Farrell could afford to pick a much-changed side, whose enthusiasm more than made up its striking lack of experience. As well as the youthful, free-spirited ambition of the performance, there was a pleasing diversity to the team as well, from the Enniskillen-born and reared Robert Baloucoune to Gavin Coombes from Skibbereen . The starting XV was neatly drawn from Leinster, Munster and Ulster - which each provided five players - while the bench was drawn from all four provinces and featured four Connacht players. So this finale to the season will also feed back into the provinces. Four summers ago on the tour to the USA and Japan, James Ryan, Jacob Stockdale and Andrew Porter were three of the eight debutants who quickly became staple parts of the squad during an all-conquering 2018 as a prelude to the 2019 World Cup. If three, or more, of the nine Irish players who made their debuts over the last two weeks go on to establish themselves in the frontline squad from next season onwards that would be a good return. You'd back the aforementioned Baloucoune and Coombes to do so. The former has genuine X-factor and while we knew about the quality of Coombes' work on both sides of the ball, and his eye for the try line, his performance last Saturday showcased the subtlety and variety of his handling game.  When you also consider Jack Conan and Caelan Doris, CJ Stander's retirement doesn't appear to have the left void that might have been the case given his indestructibility and voracious workload. But Conan, Doris and now Coombes as much as any of them have shown that this Irish team can have another dimension with more of a playmaker, or enabler, at '8'.  The decision to have Garry Ringrose undergo a procedure on what must have been a troublesome shoulder problem proved a blessing in disguise. James Hume has strength, footwork, offloading and a range of passing which are the hallmarks of a quality player. His problem is the logjam in the Irish midfield, with a couple of them on Lions duty and a fully fit, recharged Ringrose back next season.  Although they weren't making their debuts, on their first starts last Saturday both Ryan Baird (another to add to the improving skillset of the Irish forwards) and Craig Casey went some way toward cementing their place in the squad.  Record-equalling  Plus, of course, Ronan Kelleher has surely established himself as Ireland's first-choice hooker going into the 2021-22 season, and all the more so if the Lions confirm today that he is South Africa-bound. For sure Kelleher's record-equalling haul of four tries, like the majority of his 14 tries in just 38 games for province and country, is in large part down to the quality of the Leinster and Irish mauls. But in his dynamic carrying he has a point of difference which can make him world class.  Yes, there were another two lineout blips against the USA (not both his fault) to add to the three against Japan, but his darts are actually quite good for a 23-year-old, and probably better than Keith Wood or Jerry Flannery at the same age. Often using the under-rated passing skills of Stuart McCloskey and then Joey Carbery as a second receiver in the wrap, Ireland have looked a potent and well coached side this past couple of weeks, especially considering that was basically a brand new team against the Eagles.  Even leaving aside a maul that has rediscovered its teeth, this five-game winning run, and the range of strike plays over the last two games has underlined how the Irish lineout is the absolute life blood of their attack. Hence, in all of this, Farrell's best move of the season was to enlist Paul O'Connell, despite it being questioned at the time. It has been a masterstroke. Indeed, another feature of this Irish set-up is how well they have finished each of their micro campaigns in bio-secure bubbles during this prolonged and trying season.  They have finished them all with a flourish, which is a healthy reflection of squad spirit as well as the quality and standard of training in their new High Performance Centre in Abbotstown."

First up it's the plethora of strategic failures Fine Gael made before and during the campaign. Maybe Kate O'Connell would have beaten Ivana Bacik. Maybe not. But what she would definitely have done is saved Fine Gael from themselves during the campaign. Not only did they not win, but the party is damaged as a result. O'Connell, who lost her seat in the last election, is a rare Fine Gaeler who can garner support from people who don't like the party. She has been working on the frontline of the pandemic as a pharmacist in the community, vaccinating constituents. Her Repeal credentials are strong, something that mattered in this election - just look at the number of candidates who came from activist politics. I'm also not sure how any strategist could think a woman wasn't going to get elected here.  Fine Gael's strategy to entrench a Fine Gael versus Sinn Féin binary was a bizarre move, considering Bacik was clearly the strongest candidate from the outset. But the negativity Fine Gael brings to elections superseded sense. I've heard a lot of people say that they couldn't make a bogeywoman out of Bacik, so they had to go after Sinn Féin.  This reflex Why? How little do they have to say for themselves that they have to keep talking about another party? This reflex, which they can't seem to rid themselves of, constantly backfires. It makes floating voters really dislike Fine Gael  and it plays into Sinn Féin's hands. On Thursday night they saved their lowest point of the campaign for last, tweeting an alert: ""Big Sinn Féin turnout being reported. Don't let Sinn Féin in by staying home.""  What they meant was: people in working-class areas are voting. This carry-on is nasty and alienating. On Claire Byrne's radio programme on Friday, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin rightly admonished Fine Gael for this classist, negative campaigning.  So why are Fine Gael such poor campaigners under Leo Varadkar? One recent moment sticks out. Varadkar berated Pearse Doherty in the Dáil about what the Tánaiste characterised as his performative outrage for the benefit of social media.  Which raised two questions. Firstly, why is Varadkar never visibly angry, upset or at his wits end about the housing crisis? Everyone else is. We're living it. Secondly, a party that was posting videos of its politicians baking scones in the middle of a pandemic does not get to call others out on performative social media content. Therefore, if the 2020 general election campaign exposed Fine Gael's disconnection from the electorate, this byelection exposed their lack of self-awareness.  Bacik ran a positive campaign that had depth on issues. This is what people responded to, along with the fact she is a unique candidate who transcends Labour. For years she has walked the walk, and now Ireland has caught up with her. What was once radical, and apparently ""unelectable"", is now mainstream, and clearly very electable indeed. This is a profound shift. A lesser-spotted trend in this constituency is that it had already shifted from centre-right to centre-left. In 2016 three centre-right politicians were elected first, second and third - Eoghan Murphy, O'Connell (both Fine Gael) and Jim O'Callaghan (Fianna Fáil), followed by Eamon Ryan of the Greens. In 2020 Ryan topped the poll by a huge margin, followed, remarkably, by Sinn Féin's Chris Andrews and only then Murphy and O'Callaghan. If anyone is under threat come the next election, it's O'Callaghan.  How could a sitting TD in the constituency, with nearly 14 per cent of first-preference votes last year, not get more than a third of those same people to vote Fianna Fáil? The campaign began with goofy videos and was quickly followed by a clatter of bizarre micro-scandals about  past behaviour of their candidate, Deirdre Conroy. Video footage on polling day of a car rolling through the constituency plugging their candidate by saying ""Is it a bird, is it a plane?"" over a megaphone was a real please-make-it-stop moment. While Fianna Fáil may want a postmortem of their campaign, perhaps they'd be better off just forgetting it ever happened. The whole thing was like a bad trip.  There are two measurements that are crucial to contemporary politicians. The first are the four Cs; calibre, competence, connection, and character. The second is the importance of a politician's EAR: empathy, authenticity, relatability. Because a generation has engaged with politics through grassroots activism and social issues, it's increasingly difficult for politicians to lean into superficiality.  Ultimately, housing is the issue of the day. Fine Gael candidate James Geoghegan's opening salvo that he wanted to be a voice for a generation locked out of the housing market was quite something, considering Fine Gael has overseen the housing crisis, their policies have worsened it and Geoghegan was running for a seat vacated by a former minister for housing who just walked away from politics altogether. It was neither an authentic message nor an authentic messenger. Voters know their stuff.  Irish politics is now a part of pop culture, and when you're out of step, you're of also out of time."

The Government has refused to join the G7 and G20 in backing proposals for an overhaul of company taxation that would set a 15 per cent floor for corporation tax, warning that it may cost the exchequer more than EUR 2 billion a year. But Mr Donohoe indicated Irish support could be possible after he met United States treasury secretary Janet Yellen, who was visiting Brussels to put pressure on holdout European Union member states to back the minimum corporation tax rate and co-ordinate on how to seal the deal along a timetable set for October. ""Ireland will continue to engage in the negotiation and the process within the OECD, all the way up to October,"" Mr Donohoe said. ""While the challenges of an agreement are apparent at the moment, equally the challenges of an agreement not being in place are equally real,"" he added. ""It is in the interests of stability, and in the interests of the principles that we talked about today with Secretary Yellen that agreement is reached, and I'm going to play my part, to see if Ireland can be part of it and if we can support it later on in the year."" Mr Donohoe held a breakfast meeting with Dr Yellen before she had a series of meetings with top EU leaders and with the eurogroup, the group of finance ministers of which Mr Donohoe is currently president. Holdouts  In an address to the finance ministers, Dr Yellen urged holdouts including Ireland, Estonia and Hungary to drop their opposition, arguing that countries needed dependable sources of revenue and taxation systems that did not worsen inequality. ""We need to put an end to corporations shifting capital income to low-tax jurisdictions, and to accounting gimmicks that allow them to avoid paying their fair share,"" Dr Yellen said.  ""We need to ensure that the globalised economy does not continue to shortchange our middle classes so that it can remain open and free, thereby encouraging economic growth and business certainty,"" she added. ""This race to the bottom must end, and working together we can ensure that it does."""

At stake is Ireland’s low official corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent and a tax regime that helps global companies based there avoid paying taxes to other countries where they make profits, a setup that has put billions of euros into Ireland’s tax coffers and created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Ireland was one of only nine countries not to sign on to the sweeping framework last week, overseen by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that could undermine those advantages. The accord would impose a new 15 percent global minimum corporate tax rate and force technology and retail giants to pay taxes where their goods or services were sold, rather than where the company had its headquarters.

They employ an estimated 180,000 workers and indirectly support another 144,000 jobs in Ireland’s economy. The largess can be seen on the streets of Dublin and beyond, where some of Europe’s most robust tech and pharmaceutical clusters have blossomed over the years. Construction companies build ever more housing and office space to accommodate the multinationals’ expansion. In Silicon Docks, Google’s European headquarters alone span four buildings, featuring a wellness center and a swimming pool. Over the years, cash has flowed to hotels, retailers, restaurants and pubs where well-salaried employees spend their income. Critics say Ireland’s tax regime has led to a two-speed economy in which multinationals and their employees pull ahead while the domestic economy plods along. While the government has vowed to address such issues, it is also concerned about the impact on future foreign investment should Ireland no longer be able to use low taxes as its main calling card.  “Ireland will become a less attractive place for multinational investment in future years,” said James Stewart, an adjunct professor of finance at Trinity College in Dublin. “You won’t get a sudden bang, but there will be a gradual shift away.” The O.E.C.D. insists that countries could still offer tax holidays and exemptions as long as they complied with minimum corporate tax levels.

Regulators have issued more than 20 'risk mitigation programmes' to investment firms, stock exchange-listed companies and their advisors ordering them to make specific changes to their behaviour by the end of the year or face enforcement action. The Central Bank has also sent 'Dear CEO' letters to dozens of companies involved in issuing or dealing shares outlining industry-wide instances of failures to put up adequate defences against market abuse. The letters specify numerous deficiencies in surveilling, identifying and reporting insider trading risks, indicating many firms are taking a tick-box approach to curbing market abuse. For example, half of the 42 equity issuers on the Irish stock exchange assessed by the Central Bank ""could not evidence a sufficiently articulated approach to identifying inside information"", according to one of the letters. Regulated trading firms were also found to have ineffective alerts for identifying market abuse, with some of them calibrating risk parameters to produce fewer warning signs and, therefore, less work. Some firms even permitted staff to disable or adjust trading surveillance systems without appropriate permission, which could allow illegal trading to go undetected. ""As the scale of securities market activity carried on in and from Ireland increases, so too does the obligation of market participants to ensure their organisational arrangements to identify, mitigate, and manage market abuse risk are effective, having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of their operations,"" said Derville Rowland, Central Bank director general for financial conduct. ""We expect individual entities to address these requirements comprehensively and without delay."" The letters and risk mitigation programmes are the result of a deep-dive exercise by regulators to measure compliance with market abuse laws that require firms to have strong firewalls against bad actors. The risk of market participants committing market abuse has increased due to factors such as post-Brexit growth, new technologies, and pandemic-related issues, the Central Bank said.

The Iseq index of Irish shares fell 2.41pc on the day, reversing a generally positive trend for equities that has persisted for months as economies have gradually re-opened. Bank of Ireland, a bellwether stock for the domestic economy, fell 5.4pc while Flutter, which is heavily exposed to the growing US gambling market, dropped by a little more than 4pc. Smurfit Kappa, Ryanair, CRH and Kerry Group all finished down, as well. Bucking the trend, Irishlisted real estate investment trusts (Reits) all finished in positive territory. European stocks posted their worst session in two months with all sectors in the red as concerns about the resilience of economic recovery sent investors fleeing to bonds. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.8pc, with a European Central Bank move to shift its inflation target to 2pc from ""below but close to"" that figure seen as dovish and doing little to cap declines. ""Achieving 2pc inflation won't be easy,"" said Jai Malhi, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. ""With low inflation even more entrenched in the eurozone, this change from the European Central Bank means policy will remain loose for even longer."" Eurozone banks slid nearly 3pc as government bond yields extended their falls. While many investors struggle to fully grasp the triggers behind the global bond rally, a broad rethink of the reflation narrative and a sense that economic growth may have peaked are common explanations, together with hedge funds unwinding bets gone wrong. The day's slide pushed the Stoxx 600 into negative territory for the month, putting it on course to break a fivemonth winning streak. It is now 2pc away from record highs. Until Wednesday, the index was only off 0.2pc from the peak of 460.51. Deteriorating economic indicators from Europe, the US and China have dented market sentiment as has the , the spread of the new, and highly infectious, Delta coronavirus variant.

For his key role in the design and delivery of the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine, the director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University, which designs and develops vaccines for infectious diseases like HIV, malaria and TB, will receive an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth. ""It's the icing on the cake after a very busy year,"" he says, while acknowledging the efforts of the whole Oxford-based team, including Irish professor Teresa Lambe and many other scientists who worked tirelessly to create a vaccine against Covid-19. ""Up until now, the largest number of doses of any vaccine produced in one year has been around 400 million doses - for a flu vaccine. This year, globally, we're aiming to produce five billion doses and two to three billion should be of the vaccine made in Oxford. We're trying to do something unprecedented here. ""The plan is to get vaccine-induced herd immunity. If you're in an upper to middle income economy, it will be more achievable, but the world's poor have to be protected too. The numbers of doses required is enormous, so the task is complex and expensive. That is why we insisted on a low price for the AstraZeneca vaccine."" In Africa, for example, vaccine distribution is slow, with some countries like Chad vaccinating fewer than 1 per cent of its population thus far. Prof Hill, who is originally from Ranelagh, attended Belvedere College in Dublin before studying medicine at Trinity College. In 1978, he transferred to Magdalen College, Oxford for a year and has been in Oxford ever since. South Pacific  After finishing his medical degree, Hill travelled to the small island group of Vanuatu in the South Pacific to complete his PhD in molecular medicine, focusing on the genetics of Pacific islanders, namely the distribution and molecular basis of thalassaemia (an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to have less haemoglobin than normal). A research stint in Micronesia, another archipelago in Oceania, followed. ""I did a lot of travelling during the 1980s. While spending time in Zimbabwe with my uncle, who was a priest there, I became interested in malaria and other tropical diseases. I was also struck by the knowledge the local doctors had in gunshot wounds from the recent civil war."" He joined the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine as a Wellcome senior fellow in 1988 and began work on immunogenetics in west Africa, which led to his focus on malaria vaccine development. Since 1997, his team has developed numerous candidate vaccines for malaria, particularly some which produce cellular T-cell immunity. They have conducted more than 70 trials for malaria vaccines in Europe (in Oxford, London and Dublin) and Africa. In response to the need for research spaces for trials, he founded the Jenner Institute, also at Oxford University, in 2005. ""We wanted to create a space where lots of key early stage trials can take place. We work on the design of new vaccines, then preclinical studies, leading to phase one and two clinical trials. These data are essential before any vaccine company would want to license a vaccine, develop it further and subsequently bring to market. ""We have our own pilot manufacturing plant capable of producing a batch of up to 1,000 doses."" Prof Hill says finding funding for the likes of malaria is difficult, as ""those who need it most, can't afford it"". But, despite the difficulties in developing a vaccine for parasitic diseases, the Jenner Institute's malaria vaccine candidate earlier this year achieved 77 per cent efficacy in early stage trials, making it the first malaria vaccine to meet the WHO's target of 75 per cent. In 2014, Hill's team led the first clinical trials of an Ebola vaccine in west Africa, using a chimpanzee adenovirus vector to generate an immune response, a vaccine technology he has pioneered since 2006.  But his most high profile success has been his work on the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which was backed by the UK government.  ""The chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine for the coronavirus was created in the Jenner Institute within six weeks and clinical trials started in April 2020 with over 60,000 people enrolled in trials in five continents by the end of the year,"" he says.  Oxford's vice-chancellor, Irishwoman Louise Richardson - the university's first female head since 1230 - said the vaccine would be a non-profit public health tool. Prof Hill was involved in finding the industrial partners.  ""We partnered with AstraZeneca, the Serum Institute of India and many other manufacturers to create a vaccine that costs about $3, so that low income countries can afford to buy large quantities of it."" At what point did he and other researchers know that the world was heading towards a pandemic?  ""When we found that people could be asymptomatic but still pass on the virus, so in January last year. Modern air travel, despite its benefits, certainly helped spread the virus quickly."" Prof Hill says the level of safety surveillance being conducted on those who are vaccinated is unprecedented in scale.  ""Vaccine safety research, particularly modern health surveillance involving data record linkage, can rapidly review potential side effects in millions of vaccinated people. This is how the very rare vaccine-linked clotting issue was first picked up. It could never have been identified so quickly after previous vaccines were first distributed.  ""Interestingly, recent vaccine surveillance suggests this rare side effect is even less common in India, South America and in African countries."" Death rate  Despite the global repercussions of Covid-19, Hill says things could be a lot worse. ""We were 'lucky' with Covid-19 because the proportion of those infected who die is low - under 1 per cent. With Ebola, the death rate is between 40 and 60 per cent."" He warns that this will not be the world's last pandemic, especially as climate change is forcing animals from their natural habitats. ""This is why we need to build and invest in more manufacturing facilities with specialist staff to manufacture vaccines at a large scale, for when the next bad one comes along. We need to have those huge plants across the world, not just in Asia. ""When you think of military or nuclear defence investments over the past 20 years, compared to investment in pandemic preparation, it's merely a drop in the ocean. These vaccine manufacturing plants could be used for different products at other times, but we need them.  ""Adequate pandemic preparedness will cost billions but the economic cost of Covid-19 has been in trillions,"" Prof Hill says. ""Scientists warned the world of a pandemic, but it fell on mostly deaf ears despite the fact that, in just 20 years, we've had the original Sars virus outbreak in 2002, bird flu and then swine flu, Zika, Chikungunya, Mers, Ebola and now a really big one, Covid-19."" After 43 years at Oxford, Prof Hill is firmly rooted at one of the world's leading universities. In the coming years, the Jenner Institute will streamline outbreak pathogen research, and find a more rapid way of developing newer vaccine approaches, like intranasal vaccines.  Oxford is also founding a new institute, The Pandemic Sciences Institute, which will include a number of core technologies and collaborate with global research centres to ensure the world is better equipped to counter future pandemics.  ""We will always have outbreaks. The real challenge is to be able to respond more quickly so that a local outbreak does not become a pandemic."" After a hugely successful 18 months in terms of vaccine development, Prof Hill hopes that, through his work, he can help inspire future generations study sciences and even become vaccinologists. ""Once you get into scientific research you are hooked. It is fascinating, but also really useful,"" he says."

""She seemed ambitious and into her work,"" recalls Sylvia. But soon after starting the job - at a lower salary than her previous role, though conveniently closer to her home - their relationship soured. ""By day two, she was rolling her eyes every time I talked,"" says Sylvia. ""She began to take credit for my work in front of senior staff and found fault with my French accent - she showily bought me a dictionary, even though I'd been writing professionally in English for decades… My brain shut down and I started messing things up. I felt nauseous and totally helpless."" Sylvia says she made five complaints to the human resources department, one of which was answered. ""I was told that I needed to provide evidence of bullying, but warned in the same email it was illegal to record my colleagues without their permission."" She says she began to struggle with insomnia. ""I'd lie awake at night, [full of] selfdoubt and insecurity."" Until recently, the term 'coercive control' was used mainly to describe abusive domestic relationships, but it is being increasingly used by psychologists to describe a form of workplace bullying, much like the one Sylvia experienced, where the bully employs psychological and controlling patterns of abuse. Research shows that one in 10 Irish people have been bullied at work, while a total of 1.7 million work days are lost in Ireland each year because of bullying. As the nation prepares to return to the office, those affected by workplace bullying will be among those most keenly suffering 're-entry syndrome', with one study suggesting that females, and those aged between 26 and 45 have a higher probability of experiencing bullying. The reality of workplace bullying is often far from the old cliché of the red-faced, ranting boss. Tactics used by workplace abusers can have much in common with the patterns seen in domestic abuse, according to Irena Grgona, a clinical psychologist. ""Abusers isolate and undermine their victims, sexually harass and humiliate them, or attempt to distort or deny their victim's version of reality (the phenomenon we now know as gaslighting)."" This was the case for 57-year-old nurse Sarah. When a new line manager, Adam, was appointed at the hospital where she worked, she liked him at first: ""He seemed full of energy and ideas."" During his third week, however, he asked her to join him for coffee in the canteen. ""As soon as I sat down, he said: 'You know that you are unpopular here, don't you?' I remember I laughed reflexively. I'd always got on well with my colleagues."" The following week, she discovered that the permission to work flexi-hours, which had been in place for the past 10 years and meant she could collect her granddaughter from nursery and drop in on her elderly mother, had been withdrawn. She checked but none of her other colleagues had their flexitime withdrawn. She claims that he also restricted her toilet breaks and told her to keep a mobile phone with her at all times, including in the toilet. ""He requested my occupational health file and made it clear that he knew all about the hysterectomy I'd had a few years before. I felt violated,"" she says. But when she confided in her colleagues, they said she was paranoid. She decided not to report it, concerned that bosses might not believe her. Her husband had recently had a health scare so she felt unable to confide in him, either. ""I felt utterly alone,"" she says. ""I came close to contemplating suicide. It was only the thought of my granddaughter that stopped me."" Four months after Adam joined, she raised a grievance case with her hospital's human resources department, which was dismissed, as was a second grievance. Under the Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work, Irish employers are expected to have an anti-bullying policy and procedures for dealing with complaints. Yet Rubel Bashir, an employment solicitor at Slater & Gordon, says that cases of coercive bullying often have multiple and complex causes: ""It's difficult to find reasons for these patterns of bullying, though everything from racism to ageism can be a factor."" One of the difficulties of making a successful complaint is that the burden of proof is on the victim. ""It's very easy for employees to claim that what is in fact a campaign of victimisation is simply workplace 'performance management',"" says Bashir. ""They [the victims] ask themselves, what if my complaint is not upheld and I'm forced to continue to work in a place where I've brought these claims, possibly as the bullying worsens?"" Remote working arrangements and video meetings can make the problem even more complex, says Dublin-based career management consultant Rowan Manahan. ""Some very snippy stuff can go on online and there can be the excuse of 'that's not what I meant at all', and obviously there's no recording of the event. Yes, there are witnesses in the 'room', but it's a passing moment and they don't see the person react. ""It's one thing if you're in a [physical] room with five other people and somebody says something catastrophically horrible and you can see someone's face literally crumble as a result… it's another thing when everyone is passively looking at a screen… it's giving some people licence to behave much more brutally and much more carelessly."" Teacher Ruth (39) says that after she brought a formal grievance against the new principal at the school where she worked, he redoubled his bullying campaign against her. It began, she says, when she complained about being put on a rota to work excessive hours with no overtime pay. ""The next day, my hours Continued on Page 30 Continued from Page 29 increased further."" Later, the principal accused her of being drunk on duty and of having an affair with an older, married member of staff. ""I took a breathalyser test, which came back negative, but the false allegations didn't stop."" She also claims her work materials were interfered with ""almost daily"". ""It was being disbelieved that really ground me down,"" she says. ""I was an emotional wreck."" She has since left the school and is pursuing a personal injury claim against her former employer. Workplace bullying costs the Irish economy (EURO)239m a year in sickness-related absences, reduced productivity and staff turnover, according to research from NUI Galway. One of the problems is people's reluctance to speak out, with barriers to being able to do so higher during remote working, when there may have been no witnesses to this sort of abuse. ""Colleagues often resist getting involved out of fear of getting bullied themselves, or of making matters worse,"" says Beverley Stone, a business psychologist. But she points out that there is a ""growing awareness of concepts such as gaslighting, passive aggression and coercive control"". Dublin-based psychotherapist Donna McArdle says employers often try to solve the issue by moving the bully to another department. ""[Bullies] are not team players and a lot of the time they're causing havoc so they'll often get moved, and promoted in the process. It gives them even more power, which is totally the wrong thing to do."" Looking back, Sarah wishes she had trusted her instincts earlier. ""After those first colleagues didn't stand up for me, I kept silent. I now know I should have kept talking about his behaviour and how abnormal it was."" However, she adds: ""I think we are in the early days of understanding what workplace bullying means. It's going to take a culture shift to see that the worst bullying [might not be] out there for all to see - and the deepest scars aren't necessarily visible."" * Some names have been changed © Telegraph Media Group Limited (2021) Graphic   People are reluctant to speak out against bullies.

Despite excitable headlines at the weekend, any immediate threat to party leaderships had evaporated by Monday. By far the biggest loser was Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar. The Tanaiste has never won an election since he became boss four years ago and now adds five bye-election defeats to his disastrous 2020 general election. Once again, however, his tenure was not the focus of attention after such a high-profile loss. His poor judgment in pushing through the bland James Geoghegan as candidate in revenge for Kate O'Connell's refusal to swear doting fealty goes unpunished. Varadkar has the ridiculous posturing of Marc MacSharry to thank for that. A cohesive Fianna Fail would have allowed the pressure of Fine Gael's defeat in their flagship constituency simmer for the weekend. Instead, the party decided to punch itself in the face repeatedly. The permanently disgruntled MacSharry wants Micheal Martin's resignation and has gone on the hunt for signatures for a heave. Even his favoured replacement, Jim O'Callaghan, has said he's not interested in the coup right now. How could he, after running a campaign that returned a five per cent vote, putting his 2025 re-election in doubt? This leaves the Sligo TD looking even more foolish than usual ? and this is a man who invoked South Africa's racist apartheid regime in the debate about indoor dining. He also said restrictions on bars were akin to the Stasi regime. Somebody needs to send MacSharry a history book, assuming he can read. Martin probably feels some pressure but will take solace in the fact the only sounds of rebellion are coming from the predictable quarters of MacSharry and Barry Cowen. The latter he rightly sacked from Cabinet over a drink-driving conviction. The former, Ray MacSharry's son, lacks credibility, having never lived down being humiliated by Pat Rabbitte at the banking inquiry in 2015 when the Labour man quipped: ""I notice sometimes, Senator, that talent skips a generation."" The Taoiseach has stayed quiet, knowing the Dail summer recess buys him time. The natural clock of his leadership is ticking towards the December 2022 handover anyway. He may also think that, in time, Leo faces bigger challenges with his leaking investigation still ongoing. Yet still Leo's greatest enemy remains himself. Following the rejection of his preferred candidate, he decided humility wasn't really his thing. He talked it up as a victory, noting that the bye-election result was in line with the FG vote in Dublin Bay South last year. But bye-elections don't work that way. His man was meant to top the poll at a minimum and then battle it out for transfers. Instead, Ivana Bacik's win embarrassed Geoghegan decisively into second place and leaves questions about who runs there next time around. Kate O'Connell was smiling somewhere. Simon Coveney, O'Connell's preference for leader in 2017, carries on his business quietly and assuredly. Varadkar's allies in the party have left politics ? Murphy, Michael D'Arcy, Brian Hayes. John Paul Phelan is now a vocal critic. Another, Helen McEntee, is a potential leadership rival. Varadkar looks isolated and despite his scheduled elevation to Taoiseach for the second time without winning an election, soon his party will ask what exactly Fine Gael's pitch is to be in the next election. By 2025 he'll be 14 years at Cabinet, allowing a housing crisis to go out of control, and will ask voters to extend his run to 19 years. Good luck with that. Given the Government's steadfast support for investment funds profiting from insane rents and blocking families and workers from home ownership, the housing crisis will remain the biggest issue. It'd be a Godsend to Sinn Fein to have him as Mary Lou McDonald's 2025 rival. You can almost predict FG's campaign ? scarifying talk about Sinn Féin's past and talking up how well got Leo is in Europe and among the business types. The counter message is child's play.

There were 408,015 people either unemployed or on Covid support payments last month, which is an unemployment rate of 18.3%. But the figure has fallen by almost 171,000 from 578,749 a year ago, when the rate was almost 26%. And over the month, it is down more than 79,000 from 487,122 in May. However, Andrew Webb, chief economist with consulting firm Grant Thornton Ireland, said that the staggered reopening is still very difficult for employers.

'The latest unemployment figures are testament to that challenge, and reflect the deep economic pain of the past 15 months. The [rise] in the employment figures this month, particularly in the pandemic-adjusted rate, offers some hope that as the economy reopens, there is strong demand for labour.

But then a noticeable thing happened. By the end of the meeting, both sides had effectively joined hands to conclude that the State is the only actor with the power and resources to lead the sector out of crisis. It is obvious by this stage in the pandemic that with almost-unrestrained public spending to ward off disaster, Big Government is back in business. But it is also now back for business. Whole sections of the market economy, such as retail and hospitality, are wobbling like drunks on stilts and politicians look like the only people who can intervene to restore some semblance of stability. Whether or not you believe that heavy-handed political intervention may have caused some of the current difficulties in the first place, all sides seem to be onboard, for now, with the return of Big Government for the economy. Like it nor not, it is here to stay for the foreseeable future. Typically there is a Punch and Judy element whenever you put representatives of workers (virtually) into a room with the lobbyists for the businesses that employ them. Pay us more. We can't afford it. Oh yes you can. Oh no we can't. And there was some of that when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Mandate appeared at the committee with employers' group, Retail Excellence. But then a convergence happened. As he implored the State for a ""dig out"" to help the industry recover from Covid and cope with the shift to online shopping, Ecco Shoes retailer, Keith Rogers, told the committee that he had paid all of his staff fully throughout the State's anti-virus closure periods. As a result, Rogers said, there is now a togetherness between his employees and the company, and Ecco has benefitted upon reopening as a result. Akin to a preacher  Gerry Light, the veteran Mandate official who has crossed swords with numerous retailers over the decades, was akin to a preacher who had lived to see the non-believers finally bathed in light. If you treat workers well, it is good for business, he said. ""We have always known that."" And so all sides signalled joint support for a centralised stakeholders forum, overseen by the State, to chart a way forward for a sector where workers complain of low pay, but which has also been battered by anti-virus trading restrictions. This has occurred against the backdrop of even more insidious turmoil, wrought by the relentless march of giant web retailers such as Amazon. Those trends have laid waste to many shopping streets and the long-term commercial viability of some town and city centres is now clearly under threat. The market isn't going to save them. Arguably, at least in the case of the shift to online, the market has caused the problem. The issue of how to save urban centres from sliding into a pit of degeneration is too complex, with too many moving parts, for local authorities to handle. Only a centralised Government policy framework stands any chance of success. At Wednesday's committee hearing, retailers also implored the Government to step in with landlords who refuse to give shop owners discounts on rent for the State-mandated closure periods in the first four months of the year. That intervention may prove legally difficult to plot through the thickets of contract law. But the message from Retail Excellence was that the State is the only hope. The masses of the hospitality and tourism sector are also huddled around the entrance to the State's tent of plenty. Tourists cannot travel in or out of the country because of Government rules. Customers soon won't be able to have a meal or a drink indoors without a Government pass. The industry is riddled with insolvent businesses that are being kept undead on Government money. The blizzard of trading restrictions on tourism and hospitality businesses to address public health priorities are all, effectively, credit entries in the sector's ledger. They will have to be balanced out with debt entries - transfusions of public cash in ever-more creative ways - for years to come. That is the unavoidable price of the restrictions, unless a political decision is made in future to let some operations slide into insolvency to ameliorate it. Tourism and hospitality businesses will not be able to simply ""trade their way out"" of the difficulties the restrictions have created. Like it or not, the entire industry is now one big semi-State operation for the next five years at least. State viceroy  Related to this, the aviation sector is another part of the economy that will require a State viceroy for years to come. The stampede in coming years to tempt back airlines and routes with public subsidies will test the boundaries of State aid rules. In the medium-term, businesses operating in the housing and land markets will feel the effects of further Government intervention. For myriad reasons, the market has failed to deliver on a basic public requirement so the Government will pick up the slack. Looking even further beyond the pandemic, other public priorities such as the fight against climate change will, over time, spur even greater State intervention in the everyday operations of businesses. That statement is meant neither as a call to arms nor as a complaint. Merely, it is a statement of fact, a prediction of what is coming, rolling over the hills like weather. There is no point shaking your fist at it. Businesses must, and will, learn how to live with that kind of ongoing Government intervention. Issues such as climate change and, latterly, the pandemic seem to have shredded certain orthodoxies around how the economy should be run, for now. This trend was apparent even before the current crisis. I attended a conference run by the employers' lobby, Ibec, last February and took note when its chief executive, Danny McCoy, made the case for greater State intervention in the economy to address the issues of the age. It went almost unremarked upon at the time, but it seemed to me a watershed. Pendulums swing from one side to the other, and it currently seems to be on the side of greater Government shepherding of businesses and the economy. But there were also good reasons why the State retreated from much of the economy between the 1980s and the noughties. It had begun to get in the way of innovation and improvement. That may be a lesson that we have to learn all over again sometime in the future, whenever the pendulum swings back. But until then, Big Government in the economy is back in fashion. Everybody had better get used to it."

Leonardo Spinazzola was on course for a strong shout, while Federico Chiesa's final showing perhaps places him above Lorenzo Insigne. Gianluigi Donnarumma collected the UEFA gong for his spot-kick heroics, while Jorginho ticks pretty much all of the boxes. And yet, in years to come, when people think of this competition they will speak of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini. Both would be worthy winners but the slight preference is for the senior partner, Chiellini, who has now taken on an iconic status. BEST GOAL The case against Patrick Schick's goal for the Czech Republic against Scotland is that the 'keeper was off his line and it was an instinctive swing of the boot as opposed to a wonderful team move. Paul Pogba (v Switzerland) and Lorenzo Insigne (v Belgium) scored superb goals in tighter spots under pressure. But Schick was on the run too and executing the perfect curl and flight to hit the target puts it top of the tree. BREAKTHROUGH STAR It has to be Pedri. Kylian Mbappe was 19 when he took Russia by storm. Pedri was on course for a comparable impact until penalty shootout heartache in the semi-final. He's the good-news story that both Spain and Barcelona need right now. HE SAID WHAT? NO. 1 ""It doesn't matter who goes through here because I believe England will beat both those sides. I just feel no one can compete with us right now with the confidence we've got. People might say I'm getting carried away but I don't care."" You really can't blame BBC for having an England focus during the Euros semi with Italy and Spain but Rio Ferdinand probably did get a little carried away. Either that, or he thinks Sunday was a bottle job. MAGIC MOMENT NO. 1 Stacks to choose from but there was something especially sweet and satisfying about the Andreas Christensen thunderbolt for Denmark against Russia which sent the Copenhagen crowd wild and effectively confirmed their progression through a traumatic group stage. WORST PARENT Anyone involved with schoolboy or schoolgirl sport at any level will know that the biggest sideline menace can be parents struggling to keep their emotions in check. This can also translate to the top level of sport with Veronique Rabiot, the mother of France's Adrien, picking fights with the families of Mbappe and Pogba in the aftermath of the dramatic loss to www.Switzerland.TV STARS In player ratings terms, there was a shortage of 9/10 performances but a lot of solid showings. Didi Hamann's rage after England's progression was amusing and Damien Duff chucked out a few quality one-liners. The tactical analysis of Emma Hayes on ITV won praise, while Alex Scott and Cesc Fabregas handled the Christian Eriksen situation better than most. On the commentary front, Des Curran excelled on RTÉ, his reading of the game was no surprise to those who've listened to his League of Ireland commentaries. THEFT OF THE TOURNAMENT Identity is obviously a complicated issue in Northern Ireland and the use of God Save The Queen as their anthem has always been slightly contentious under the heading of inclusivity. What their fans did all enjoy on their Euros journey in 2016 was the adopting of Sweet Caroline as a substitute anthem around their fixtures. England's stealing of it is probably worth a thesis of some description. HE SAID WHAT? NO. 2 ""People have tried to invade us and we've had the courage to hold that back. You can't hide that some of the energy in the stadium against Germany was because of that."" Gareth Southgate is a fantastic spokesman for England but he temporarily lost the run of himself in the build-up to the final with a quote that was splashed across the front of the rabble-rousing elements of the English media. Of course, the final day ended up with a section of English fans trying to invade their own stadium. Old habits die hard and all that. SPARE A THOUGHT FOR ... Sky Sports News has largely been on the outside of the England drama during the competition with all eyes on BBC and the ITV but they would have expected to come into their own for victory day celebrations. Instead, their output yesterday consisted of highlights such as the English kit getting wheeled out of the team hotel and an interview with Lewis Holden, a supporter who got the trophy tattooed onto his leg in a premature act of celebration after the semi. ""It's one of them things,"" said Lewis who has no plans to cover it up. TOP HEADLINE The back page of last Thursday's 'Metro Scotland' was a picture of Raheem Sterling going down in the box against Denmark with the words: ""They Think It's Fall Over"". Bualadh bos. MAGIC MOMENT NO. 2 The sight of Chiellini going on the overlap in injury-time of extra-time summed up the attitude that the victors brought to the final. To be fair, it did also illustrate that Roberto Mancini's side had managed to play a fair bit of the game in the English half. UNSUNG HEROES A strange aspect was the extent to which whipping boys went down with their head held high. Save for one mistake, Pogba was excellent for an underperforming French. Haris Seferovic has come in for serious stick in Switzerland yet he rose to the challenge. There was a bizarre conclusion to Jordan Pickford's journey as winning a penalty head-tohead with Jorginho, arguably the best save of his career, was almost forgotten within 30 seconds. MINNOW MOMENT Finland's historic victory over Denmark naturally played second fiddle to the major story of that day so, leaving that aside, the outstanding joyous moment for an underdog was 37-year-old Goran Pandev registering North Macedonia's first major-tournament goal. The well-travelled Serie A fixture was coaxed out of international retirement in 2015.

So I watched Amazon Prime's Clarkson's Farm on my todd - and have concluded that Jeremy Clarkson is bloody marvellous. I loved it, but more importantly, so have millions of others, turning the show into a massive streaming hit. In the process, Clarkson has probably done more for farmers' reputations than any farming lobby group, PR campaign or protest. For a start, it's great telly, with loads of laugh-out-loud moments. I got a perverse pleasure watching the massively wealthy ex-Top Gear presenter get a hop off his electric fencer while he tries to set it up. Meanwhile, Clarkson's occasional handyman, Gerald, is unreasonably hilarious every time he tries to explain stone-wall repairs in his bewildering Cotswolds accent. The wider cast of workers and advisors provide the perfect foil for Clarkson's farming follies. A 21-year-old local contractor regularly gives him a good dressing down for his ineptitude in a tractor. Meanwhile, his farm advisor does his best to remain patient with his rookie client. Bedfellows These unlikely bedfellows ensure Clarkson stays anchored to the realities of the job. Admittedly, Clarkson hams it up for the cameras as the clueless urbanite trying his hand at running a 1,000 acre farm. But there are enough genuine moments of anger, despair, delight and trepidation to allow Clarkson's trademark OTT voiceovers fade into the background. These authentic highs and lows resonate deeply with farmers. But they also transcend the urbanrural divide to turn yet-anotherfarming-programme into the global phenomenon it has become. After 20 years trying to capture the essence of farming on camera for Ear to the Ground, I have plenty of opinions on what constitutes a good farming programme. And I reckon that Clarkson's Farm ticks every box. Farmers regularly bend my ear about the lack of 'real' farming on Ear to the Ground, but of course there's a reason for everything. There's never going to be a fiveminute segment about the bloody torture of getting a three-point linkage lined up on some modern machine that will sooner squash you than yield to logic and sweat. But insert the often comic personality of Clarkson into the mix, throw enough cameras and time at the production, and suddenly you can capture those real moments of tiny triumphs and catastrophes in an entertaining way. And lest you think that it is all just Clarkson huffing and puffing over basic farm skills, the programme makers also manage to thread a lot of the big issues throughout the episodes. Despite the huge size of the holding, getting endless advice, and buying all the kit required, Clarkson still only made a miserable £144 for a year of his efforts. Yes, he netted nearly (EURO)100,000 in CAP subsidies, but that might well evaporate now that Britain has bailed out of the EU. The viewer also gets a flavour of the endless paperwork and bureaucracy as Clarkson tries to add value to his produce through a farm shop and grain assurance scheme. Diversity The former journalist also wryly notes the alarming lack of diversity in agriculture as he surveys the sea of grey-haired white men that dominate a machinery auction. Clarkson highlights the latent dangers of dealing with machinery, the farcical price that wool makes, the lottery that is nature and weather, and the obstinate thickness of a flock of sheep. There's also dollops of wackiness sprinkled throughout. Clarkson was convinced that a barking drone was the future for rounding up his sheep. It wasn't. A tweet to his seven million followers about his new farm shop results in mile-long traffic jams, only for customers to find the shed stocked with nothing but spuds. When the water quality tests for his bottled water brain-wave arrive back, Clarkson discovers that his water is laced with E. coli. If there is a criticism, it's that there's zero financial jeopardy for Clarkson, regardless of the outcome of his farming endeavours. With earnings from his writing and presenting estimated to be worth over (EURO)15m a year, Clarkson can afford to farm as badly as he likes. But the farmer in me will be eternally grateful to him for the window he opened onto the agricultural world for people who normally couldn't care less about farmers. The presenter in me is also more than a small bit envious of the programme's success. But in an era when farming is struggling to convince the public of its merits, Clarkson's Farm has done the sector a massive service.

214,214,/home/paultrust/Downloads/Files(415)/Jeremy Clarkson is doing wonders for farming - whether you like him or loathe him.DOCX,The Irish Times,2021-07-06,1226 words,OPINION; Pg. 16,Shana Cohen,NA,Job creation alone will not restore faith in democracy; Citizens need policies that facilitate life choices and their aspirations,FALSE,"Explaining his objectives ahead of the recent G7 meeting for an American audience, US president Joe Biden wrote in a June 5th op-ed for the Washington Post: ""[This] trip is about realising America's renewed commitment to our allies and partners, and demonstrating the capacity of democracies to both meet the challenges and deter the threats of this new age.""  The president linked explicitly public benefit at a national level with the global political power of his envisioned alliance. He asked, ""Can democracies come together to deliver real results for our people in a rapidly changing world? Will the democratic alliances and institutions that shaped so much of the last century prove their capacity against modern-day threats and adversaries?""  At the meeting itself, Biden and other leaders reinforced this optimistic message. However, in reality, and away from the fanfare of Cornwall, there is a lingering question about whether ambitious domestic policy agendas will convince citizens in democratic countries that their political system is working for them. In the US, bi-partisan legislation supporting the greatest investment in scientific research in American history and the American jobs plan are cornerstones of Biden's goal of strengthening democracy and countering authoritarianism. The legislation also responds, if only implicitly, to the correlation between declining faith in democracy and rising inequality, especially among younger generations.  Biden seems to be banking on job creation, the right to unionisation and better working conditions, wages, benefits and availability of affordable services like childcare to encourage belief in democracy. His goal is to jumpstart American manufacturing through innovation and, through this effort, generate opportunities for ""well-paying, middle-class jobs"". Investment in conservation and community resilience, as well as those services like childcare that facilitate labour-market participation, will also produce ""middle class"" jobs.  Facing their own high unemployment rates, particularly among the young, the EU and the Irish Governments' economic recovery plans aim to prepare jobseekers for the rapidly changing, post-pandemic job market. They all highlight reskilling, upskilling and lifelong learning. The Irish Government is promising 50,000 new education and training places and increased opportunity for apprenticeships and workplace experience. This effort mirrors the EU Youth Guarantee that commits to providing employment, education, an apprenticeship or traineeship to all under 30s in member states within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving education.  Reinforcing democracy  Again, all of these plans are welcome. But are they enough? If Biden and other G7 leaders are serious about reinforcing democracy, then we urgently need to ask if accelerating the growth of particular industries like clean energy, reducing domestic unemployment and improving the quality of work are truly going to convince their citizens to trust and believe in their political system?  Influencing active participation in a political system at an individual level - or at least acceptance of it as a model to be protected and cherished - is a process, not a one-off accomplishment achieved by a piece of legislation. Citizens have to be able to envisage a lifetime full of opportunities and promise, where aspirations can be achieved, precisely because they live in a democracy. This visualisation differs from any political bounce due to one specific strategy or episode - like successful vaccination campaigns (ie Boris Johnson) - or inversely, declining political fortunes due to poor management of the pandemic (ie Narendra Modi). The Chinese government's decision this year to permit families have three children [the previous two-child policy was introduced in 2016 to replace the decades-old one-child policy] offers an instructive example of the influence economic security can have on trust and respect for policy decisions and the political system they uphold. Putting aside the agenda of dealing with an ageing population, the Chinese government's pronouncement was packaged as liberation or even a celebratory moment for families. Yet, it seems to have been met instead with collective apathy. Analyses suggest that couples, especially working women, do not want the economic burden of another child in addition to the probable responsibility, often as the only child, for the care of ageing parents.  In addition, external supports, like childcare, are neither available nor affordable enough for women to be able to stay in work to earn the income necessary for another child. In sum, the Chinese government may want to influence - even impress upon - the aspirations of their citizens but they have not provided the necessary infrastructure of support for their citizens to be able to take advantage, if they so desire, of a policy change. For democratically elected governments, the lesson from this is to connect the dots or approach problems multidimensionally, and to view their societies as interconnected and complex, rather than objects to manipulate or disassemble into political supporters and opponents. For instance, here in Ireland, it does not make sense to invest in training and education without improving the working conditions of the trainers, whether university faculties or staff managing apprentices. Likewise, providing more places for further education should correspond both with reductions in the use of often-exploitative, temporary contracts in the sector and the employment of more permanent lecturers to reduce Ireland's high student/lecturer ratio, which benefits no one. Authoritarian regimes can, of course, arguably make an easier connection between sustaining a political model and economic support. They simply ensure that politically important groups benefit from policy while they restrict or even forbid public criticism, limit access to information and monitor behaviour. Of course, once the economic position and social status of these favoured groups declines, collective anxiety is likely to make citizens less afraid of repression.  Global political power I have spent many years conducting academic research in the Middle East and North Africa. Regimes have survived in part because they have invested in the growth of a middle class and routes out of poverty through access to education, jobs  and services. When this investment declines, as it has from the 1990s onwards, leaders face resistance, leading to their fall or sustained political instability.  Whether or not the Biden- and G7-led, jobs-first approach to domestic policy reinforces or even rebalances global political power remains unknown. Certainly, would-be authoritarian leaders in democratic countries seem to be facing more mobilised oppositions while weary publics call for greater attention to domestic policy. The longer-term, more ambitious, strategy would be to show that only democracies produce domestic policies detailed and far-reaching enough to look across the social and economic needs of different social groups. As critical as it is, job creation will not be enough to save democracy. That will take ensuring jobs allow for constructive life choices and aspirations for a better future.

Thirty years ago, multinational institutions were looking for cheap but educated back-office workers to reliably process the transactions that were being carried out in the real money centres of Europe, like London and Frankfurt. Ireland, with its plentiful labour and hunger for investment, was the perfect location. Deutsche, as well as dozens of other international banks, put down roots here, creating an ecosystem of those invisible services that keep global finance ticking over - payments, custody, compliance and other dull but vital functions. The problem is, important as they are, those jobs are considered ""cost centres"". In other words, they cost banks money rather than generating revenue. That makes them targets for cutting, as Dublin found out yesterday when Deutsche Bank announced it was slashing hundreds of jobs in the capital in a reorganisation of its back-office operations. The German bank is relocating 250 roles to locations in other countries and cutting loose most of its contractor workforce of about 200 people over the next year. The job cuts will leave Deutsche Bank with just 200 workers in Dublin in a dramatic reduction of its commitment to Ireland as an investment location. The move is part of a cost-cutting exercise begun two years ago at Deutsche by CEO Christian Sewing that will see the perennially underperforming bank consolidate its infrastructure into fewer locations around the world. ""We understand that the proposed plan will cause uncertainty and concern to impacted colleagues, and we are committed to supporting them through the consultation process,"" said Mary Campbell, chief country officer of Deutsche Bank Ireland. ""Dublin will continue to be an important centre for the bank."" Deutsche said it would maintain a ""significant presence"" in Ireland, where it has operated since 1991, to support Irish corporate, institutional and private wealth clients. The bank said in a statement that Dublin would remain ""a major centre"" for Deutsche Bank's corporate bank business and that it would be adding 35 roles to that unit this summer. It also said Dublin would remain an important location for the bank's data and innovation lab. That number - 35 - set against the 450 jobs that are disappearing, tells the story of how the international banking landscape in Ireland is changing. Once upon a time a bank's Irish operation helped reduce the cost base for a multinational bank. Now Ireland adds to the cost and others - Bulgaria, Turkey, Estonia - are in that space. Big names like Deutsche are still committed to the country, but as Ireland ""moves up the value chain"", moving from the back office to the front office, there will be fewer but better jobs. That's no consolation to those who will be out of work - or to those in other IFSC institutions who are now looking over their shoulders - but it is a silver lining for the Irish economy. Transitioning from a cost centre to a revenue generator will make future investment in Dublin - should it arrive - a lot stickier. But to get there, Dublin has to become a place where banking is done, not just where banking is processed. Brexit has provided an opportunity and some financial jobs have indeed migrated from the UK over the Irish sea in the last five years, but Ireland is facing a lot of competition. Getting those value-added roles is a big challenge and Ireland can't take investment for granted. As just the fifth-largest financial centre in Europe, Dublin is not an obvious first choice, so it has to compete fiercely. There is a track record here. Big banks like Barclays and HSBC have real front office operations. Fund managers like Amundi are handling investments out of Dublin, too. Those operations exist side by side with the major back office operations of State Street and BNY Mellon. But some in the industry are concerned that Ireland's reputation is challenged right now by the departures of international lenders Ulster Bank and KBC Ireland. There are indications that aggressive regulation and tough capital rules could be scaring off investors. So while Ireland is well-positioned to land more high-value investment, future success on the scale of the last 30 years is far from guaranteed.

The plan will link payments to a person's previous earnings for a period after they lose their job, but that scheme will not be implemented until 2023 at the earliest.  Speaking in Dundalk yesterday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government's Economic Recovery Plan was based on creating employment, with a focus on ""building back better"" after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Pathways to Work 2021-2025 strategy has a target of exceeding the pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2½ million people in work by 2024. It includes once-off grants of EUR 1,000 for people who are unemployed to pay for short-term accredited training courses as well as offering subsidies of up to EUR 10,000 for employers who hire people who are under 30.  With youth unemployment soaring during the pandemic over the past 18 months, the strategy aims to reduce this from 44 per cent to 12.5 per cent by 2023. Four thousand of the 10,000 paid placements offered by the new work placement experience programme would be ringfenced for the under-30s, the Government said. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said it would be open to people who had been on jobseekers' payments or the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) for more than six months. Participants would have access to formal certified and sector-recognised training, the delivery of which would be monitored by the Department of Social Protection, she said. Each would be paid EUR 306 weekly for 30 hours' work, which the Minister said was in line with open labour market rates and she encouraged employers and jobseekers to get involved. JobBridge The previous JobBridge initiative which saw people who were unemployed placed on internships with an extra EUR 52 added to their weekly social welfare payments was much criticised. More than 200 companies were investigated by Social Protection following complaints from participants, while an independent review of JobBridge found just over half of participants later found employment. Asked if she was worried that similar issues could now arise, Ms Humphreys said: ""This is a different scheme and there are a lot more protections in place."" She said the new strategy included a commitment to work on detailed proposals on the development of a new pay-related, short duration, jobseekers' payment. She said she wasn't putting a timeline for when this would be in place and proposals were not expected to be ready until next year. This means that Budget 2023 is the earliest that changes could be announced.  Implementing the 83 actions in the Pathways to Work strategy is estimated to cost EUR 390 million."

The total cost of the programme over two years is (EURO)95million, with a contribution of (EURO)27million from the National Training Fund. Speaking at the launch, the Taoiseach said: 'Last month, Government launched our Economic Recovery Plan. This plan charts Ireland's long-term, jobs-led recovery with a focus on building back better. The overall ambition of the plan is to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by reaching 2.5million people in work by 2024. Crucially, though, these jobs will be more productive, more resilient and more secure.' Ms Humphreys also said that plans for the Jobseeker's Assistance Payment to be linked to a person's previous income are currently under consideration. However, the Minister said that the proposal will be brought forward next year and will not be included in Budget 2022, indicating that it may not be introduced until 2023. A number of groups representing business welcomed the new scheme yesterday. Ibec said that it 'provides an opportunity to ensure that investment in skills development and reskilling is accelerated and aligned with the needs of the labour market'. louise.burne@dailymail.ie Appeal for antigen test pilot volunteers HIGHER Education Minister Simon Harris has urged staff and students in four of the country's top universities to volunteer for a rapid antigen test pilot programme. The project, called UniCoV, will involve a large-scale comparative analysis of rapid testing technologies for use in monitoring and preventing the spread of Covid-19 in education settings. The programme will be rolled out in NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin and University College Cork. Along with rapid antigen tests, there will be salivabased PCR tests and wastewater surveillance. Students and staff who participate will have to provide saliva samples twice weekly over the 16 weeks and drop them off at on-campus collection points. These samples will undergo PCR or LAMP testing. On the same day, those volunteers will take a selfadministered rapid nasal swab antigen test, and upload a photo of the result from their phone to a website. Those interested can sign up on the www.UniCoV.org website. Findings of the programme will help inform early warning systems for the control of future outbreaks. It is expected that over 8,000 people will participate across the four universities. Minister Harris said rapid testing may potentially become an 'important' element of the plan for a safe return to colleges.

Twenty-four Conservative MPs voted against the government, among them former prime minister Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt, Mr Johnson's rival for the party leadership two years ago. All five living former prime ministers voiced opposition to the aid cut, along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and other religious leaders. Mrs May said she was voting against a Conservative government for the first time because to support the cut would be in breach of a manifesto promise and would hurt some of the world's poorest people.  ""This isn't about palaces for dictators and vanity projects. It's about what cuts to funding mean. Fewer girls will be educated, more boys and girls will become slaves, more children will go hungry and more of the poorest people in world will die,"" she said.  'I suffered' ""I have been in this house for nearly a quarter of a century . During that time I have never voted against a three-line whip from my party. As prime minister I suffered at the hands of rebels, I know what it is like to see party colleagues voting against their government. We made a promise to the poorest people in the world, the government has broken that promise. This motion means that promise may be broken for years to come. With deep regret, I will vote against the motion today.""  The 2015 Conservative manifesto included a commitment to honour the government's obligation under the 2015 International Development Act to spend at least 0.7 per cent of gross domestic income (GNI) on overseas aid. But chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak said earlier this year that the cost of the coronavirus crisis meant the target must be temporarily reduced to 0.5 per cent of GNI, saving £4 billion a year. Ahead of  yesterday's vote the chancellor persuaded 14 Conservative rebels to change their minds when he promised the cut would be reversed when the independent Office for Budget Responsibility confirms the government is no longer borrowing for day-to-day spending and when underlying debt is falling.  But Labour leader Keir Starmer said that under current OBR projections, the conditions would not be met until 2024-2025 at the earliest. ""Anyone voting tonight, pretending to themselves it will temporary, they are not looking at the facts,"" he said. ""What the chancellor is setting out today isn't a temporary cut to overseas aid - it is an indefinite cut."" Andrew Mitchell, a former Conservative international development secretary, warned his party that the decision to cut the aid budget could alienate moderate voters who turned to the Liberal Democrats in last month's byelection in Chesham and Amersham. ""It took us 23 years - until 2015 - to achieve an overall majority by wiping out the Liberal Democrat seats, and to achieve it we secured the support of decent, internationalist, pro-development spending people, who saw from our time of austerity that we would stand by this promise. There is an unpleasant odour wafting out from under my party's front door. This is not who we are. This is not what global Britain is,"" he said."

The British prime minister said that although wearing face coverings would no longer be mandatory, the government ""expected and recommended"" that they should continue to be worn in crowded indoor settings such as on public transport and in shops. He also urged caution in returning to workplaces, saying he did not expect everyone to stop working from home right away. And although nightclubs can reopen with no capacity limits and the one-metre rule will go, large venues will be encouraged to use domestic vaccine passport to determine who should come in. ""It is absolutely vital that we proceed now with caution. And I cannot say this powerfully or emphatically enough. This pandemic is not over. This disease coronavirus continues to carry risks for you and for your family.  ""We cannot simply revert instantly from Monday, 19th July to life as it was before Covid,"" he told a press conference in Downing Street. Surge in case s  The lifting of restrictions comes amid a surge in coronavirus cases, which are currently running at more than 30,000 a day. But although the government expects case numbers to reach 100,000 a day and hospitalisations and deaths to rise as England reopens, chief medical officer Chris Whitty said he was confident the National Health Service would not be overwhelmed. ""The slower we take it, the fewer people will have Covid, the smaller the peak will be, and the smaller the number of people who go into hospital and die,"" he said. Labour criticism Labour condemned the government's decision to lift legal restrictions next week as reckless and shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth warned that a further surge in infections would cause unnecessary illness and death.  Speaking in the House of Commons, he accused health secretary Sajid Javid of taking a fatalistic approach to dealing with the virus. ""We want to see the economy reopen in a balanced, safe and sustainable way. That means maintaining certain mitigations to contain the speed at which infections are rising, to help reduce transmission and to help to limit the numbers exposed to the virus before they are fully vaccinated. Instead, the secretary of state has taken a high-risk, fatalistic approach, trying to game what might happen in the winter and deciding that infections are going up anyway,"" he said. ""Instead of caution, he is pushing his foot down on the accelerator while throwing the seatbelts off.  ""He admits that that could mean 100,000 infections a day, which means potentially thousands suffering debilitating long Covid and that, as more cases arise, more may escape, with the threat of a new, more transmissible variant emerging."" Vaccinated  Eighty seven per cent of adults in Britain have received a first vaccination dose and 66 per cent are fully vaccinated. Mr Javid said official data suggested that the vaccination programme in England had prevented between 7.5 million and 8.9 million infections, 46,000 hospitalisations and about 30,000 deaths."

In an interview with Parchment magazine, published by the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association, Ms Justice Irvine said the High Court was in ""a desperate scenario"" because of the shortages. ""To make a real difference, we need 17,"" she said. Ms Justice Irvine's comments are understood to have caused surprise in the Department of Justice - one of the departments to be represented at today's meeting - because of their forthright nature. The courts' heads have set up a committee to produce a report for the judicial planning working group to argue for significant extra resources, given extra demands caused by population growth and case law. The working group comprises officials from the Department of Justice and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is to hear from a number of bodies before drafting a report some time next year. 'Investment needed' Responding, Minister for Justice Heather Humphreys said legislation passed last month, which provided for five new High Court judges, and possibly six, was ""one of the largest increases in judges in recent memory"". The chairwoman of the Bar Council, Maura McNally SC, said significant investment in staff, buildings and IT was needed.  ""People want their day in court, but many are at the end of their tether because of delays,"" she said. People injured at work and with medical bills to pay, or those left waiting for years for a court hearing, or those unable to sell assets because of delays, ""are all tearing their hair out"", she said.

There are exotic-looking plants and lamplit tables inside an African safaristyle tent. There's vintage food trucks and palm trees and swimming pools and families feasting. I feel like I'm on an island resort or a luxury cruise-ship. But I drove just two hours from Dublin to get here - Kelly's Hotel Resort & Spa, in Rosslare. I'd love to book a room but Kelly, who runs the hotel with her dad Bill, reveals the next available is around Christmas. Kelly's is an iconic Irish hotel, run by the Kelly family for five generations, and welcoming mostly Irish guests since 1856. A few hours ago I was at another iconic hotel - Buswells Hotel in Dublin's city centre, across the road from the Dail. But at Buswells I could have my pick of bedrooms for the rest of the summer. And it's the same story in hotels across the city, where the average vacancy rate in July is a mind-blowing 90%, with just 13% booked over the next 90 days. It's just 200km up the road from Kelly's but feels like a different planet (and climate). If it wasn't for Belfast couple Joseph and Margaret O'Neill - who swam against the wave of Dubs crashing into Great Victoria Train Station daily - the buzzy Buswell's lounge would have been empty on Thursday morning. Breakfast at Buswell's used to be a feast for the senses as guests (mainly American), rubbed shoulders with politicians and suits, all fuelling up for the day on coffee and gossip. Today the front door on Molesworth Street is locked, with a sign saying the hotel is for overnight guests only. Joseph and Margaret arrived on Monday to relax after a frantic few weeks - it was daughter Stephanie's wedding last Friday. They laugh: ""We like to be different. We love Dublin. ""We wanted to just walk, eat, and relax. We love the peace and quiet and the staff are so friendly."" Pre-Cov id, 300 lunches and 250 dinners would be served on a typical day, with lots of walk-ins. Today, they may sell one lunch and 10 dinners. Paul G a l l a g h e r , DREAM TEAM Ionut Mihalcea & Buswells manager for 25 years, said: ""It's been a global catastrophe for tourism - we've borne the brunt. ""I don't know how long this can go on - most businesses put money away for a rainy day but my God, we've had a rainy 14 months and a lot of places haven't got it anymore.

""Not many can survive another open and close, to stock a hotel and Confederation bring your staff back."" The Ir i sh Tourist Industry Confederation predicts tourism revenues will plummet to (EURO)2.4billion, including air fares this year - down from (EURO)9.3billion in 2019. While Dublin suffers, hotels outside the capital, especially coastal ones, are booming. The South-East took second place in a poll of Ireland's most popular staycation destinations at 21%, behind the West coast's 46%. Around 75% of Paul's guests are North American while down in Kelly's, their saving grace is their regulars are 90% Irish, and almost all are return bookings. It's been a tough year at Kelly's too but Laura, one of six daughters, managed to keep 220 staff and most of her 30 chefs feeding guests on allinclusive packages. As Laura walks me around, mums and grannies make a beeline for her. She knows everyone by name and their kids too. It's a masterclass in oldschool hospitality, honed through the generations and instilled by her dad and mum Isabelle, who comes from Chateauneuf-Du-Pape. The couple met at a prestigious French hotel school. Laura points to tables at one of the TOP JOB Paul Gallagher resort's many indoor and outdoor restaurants. She said: ""The Kellys have sat there for 20 years, the McConns sit there - we know what they like to eat, what wine.""

At the Dail's Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday, officials from the NPHDB and the Department of Health again refused to disclose the latest total bill. NPHDB chief David Gunning said: ""If the contractor considers that under the contract there should be an extension of time, or an adjustment to the contract sum, or if the contractor has any other entitlements in connection with or under the contract, the contractor submits a claim.

It sounds like the punchline of a bad joke: you leave a small European capital behind because the cost of living is so high and find yourself living more economically in one of the most notoriously expensive cities on earth. Smith - who uses the playful stage name Kojaque - had gone to London last October to mix Town's Dead, his second album, and decided to stay on when he realised his cash would go further there. ""I found a house over here,"" he says, via Zoom, ""and the rent was cheaper than I could find in Dublin."" He misses aspects of life in his home city but, for now, he's happy with his lot in London - and there's been a special buzz on the streets this summer thanks to the lifting of Covid restrictions and the adventures of an all-conquering England football team. Town's Dead has been attracting plenty of excitable reviews - and in the UK too. In a fourstar review, the NME described the album as a ""shatteringly real reflection of Dublin life"". It will certainly have a special resonance for those who live in the city and especially anyone who feels marginalised. And it's an intriguing companion piece to another great Dublin album of 2021, For Those I Love's self-titled debut. When it came to making the album, Smith focussed on LA rapper Kendrick Lamar. ""That's how ambitious I wanted to be with the project,"" he says. ""There are two of his albums that I'm just obsessed with - To Pimp a Butterfly and Good Kid, M.A.A.D City - and I kept thinking, 'What kind of album would he have made if he lived in Dublin?' I love his storytelling, his ability to convey different emotions. His music both influences and inspires me."" If aspiring to make a hip-hop album on par with one of the greatest contemporary rappers feels like a lofty ambition, the results speak for themselves. Town's Dead is an inventive, pro- vocative collection that's rich in sonic detail and enlivened by Smith's whip-smart wordplay. While money and securing the best production talent are no obstacles to Lamar - and you can hear that in his dazzling music - it's remarkable what Smith has been able to achieve on a tiny budget. Most of the album was recorded in the family home in Cabra on Dublin's northside. ""The album was pretty much all produced on Ableton [the digital audio workstation] on my laptop,"" he says. He's self-taught. ""I just got very good at it over the past few years because I'd be practicing so much. There's a couple of my friends who are really talented producers and they all got behind me with the album."" The vocals were largely recorded in the wardrobe of his bedroom. ""I saved up to buy a good microphone and I created a bit of space in the wardrobe where the room sound was dampened and I just took it from there. I did the same with my first album - I just left some clothes in the wardrobe as a sort of soundproof device and it worked."" It works beautifully. Listen to Town's Dead and there's no indication it was made in such humble circumstances. Technology, he says, has become so advanced and affordable that resourceful musicians are able to create the sort of sound today that only hardened audio engineers and high-end recording studios could manage a generation ago. And, yet, right from the start of making the album, Smith felt that getting the textured sounds he was after would be no easy matter. ""A few years ago, when I started writing the songs, if felt like such a mammoth task [to fashion a sonically ambitious, cleverly produced album], but thanks to a lot of work and determination I was able to actualise it. If you've any vision in your head, a creative idea that torments you, you have to keep going, to see it out."" Town's Dead was born out of the idea that Dublin has lost a great deal of its soul. Smith believes that was already happening before Covid's arrival, but the pandemic has exac- erbated the feeling. He talks of a city that's become too expensive for the young and underpaid to work in, or a place that can't seem to get a handle on homelessness, of arts venues and rehearsal spaces being levelled and replaced by soulless hotels. ""People feel like they've been sold a pup,"" he says. ""Leo Varadkar tweeted recently about GDP being up, about the economy doing well, and yet people can't live in this city. They're being priced out. Saying the economy is doing well doesn't mean anything to people in working-class areas. It doesn't mean anything to creatives. When you can't find somewhere to live - something that should be a fundamental human right - it can be so difficult not to just fall into despair. You just feel like, 'I'm failing here', but it's not your fault. ""For a while, I was going to call the album Town's Dormant but then I thought, 'Fuck it - I have to come up with a harder title'. I feel it's a wake-up call. Dublin is dead - but you can change it, especially when there's so much solidarity around young people, many of whom are in the same boat. The power is in the people but change can only happen if people aren't apathetic about it and don't lose hope."" EMOTIONAL INTENSITY And it's not just the big issues that exercise Smith. ""There's a lot about Ireland that's changing for the better, but we still don't have a night mayor who's in charge of nightlife. The emphasis is on tourists, not on the people who live here. It's important to provide the sort of space where young people can come and meet and form bonds that are really important. Nightlife isn't just about going out and getting pissed - it's a release for a lot of people after working very hard all week in a very expensive city."" tling Hands The album also boasts tracks of quite startling emotional intimacy. The single, No Hands, is dedicated to his father, who died of suicide when Smith was a child. ""Although it's about the loss of my dad and all his potential,"" he said, on the song's release, ""it helped me to see the potential of my own life."" Smith is 25 now, but he's been a figure to watch for at least four years. He attracted stunning reviews for his first major work, the mini-album Deli Daydreams in 2018. A concept project, the songs revolved around the life and dreams of a shop worker. Like much of Smith's work, it was shot through with a mixture of black humour and real fury - here was a young man shining a light on those people who are often unseen in society. It was nominated for the Choice Music Prize for best Irish album, although there was controversy at the time because its scant runtime did not adhere to the award's criteria on running time or number of tracks. The rules were amended to accommodate the album. Smith was surprised and delighted with the nomination. ""I hadn't thought about the prize when I was making the album, but when I got nominated it felt like a vindication for someone who was doing everything themselves - that whole DIY mentality."" "" He was been hard at work making new music in London too - not wasting the time he would have devoted to getting his live show right. But the lure of spitting out the rhymes in front of a packed crowd is always there. After the success of Deli Daydreams, he found himself supporting rising British rapper Slowthai on tour. He'sing hoping for more of the same. ""You have to take the opportunities as they come to you,"" he says, with a smile. ""I'm hungry. I don't want to take my eye off the ball."" .

Without a win since Séamus Plunkett returned as manager, the 2019 All-Ireland quarter-finalists summoned their best display of the season at Parnell Park on Saturday. There were admittedly some nervous moments and they had an 11-point lead after 41 minutes whittled down to just two points at the second water break. Substitute Eoin O'Neill scored two goals for Antrim in that period while Neil McManus had a penalty saved as the Saffrons rallied. Laois weren't helped by the 49th minute red card dismissal of Ross King either, while they were temporarily down to 13 players as full back Seán Downey was also sent to the sin bin for the foul that led to Antrim's 45th-minute penalty. But Antrim, conquerors of Clare in the league and buoyed by their draw with Wexford in the same competition, couldn't push on for another landmark result. The second water break came at just the right time from Laois' perspective and they surged ahead from there, outscoring Antrim by 1-6 to 0-5 in the final quarter. Decisive goal  Paddy Purcell scored 2-2 in total for Laois and his second goal on the hour mark was decisive as it pushed Laois eight points clear and broke the back of Antrim's fightback. There were huge performances too from Laois goalkeeper Enda Rowland who pulled off a series of important saves, while free-taker PJ Scully tallied 0-10 and converted two sideline cuts. The preliminary round win allows Laois to advance to Monday morning's draw for the qualifiers proper, while Antrim will return to Tier 2 hurling in 2022. ""This means that Laois are playing Championship hurling again next year, it gives us a chance to get reorganised and refocused and to bounce back into a Leinster hurling championship next year,"" said manager Plunkett. ""This has been a very, very tough year. A new management team came in in a pandemic for starters and in my time involved with teams it's probably the biggest injury crisis of key players in any team I've been involved with. So I have to give incredible credit to each and every Laois player who dug out that win."" Laois brought a ferocity to the game from the off and hit the first water break with a 0-11 to 0-4 lead. Purcell's first goal in stoppage time left the midlanders 1-17 to 0-10 clear at half-time and apparently cruising.  But it was only the beginning of a dramatic period as Antrim battled bravely with substitute O'Neill throwing them a lifeline with goals in the 44th and 52nd minutes.

Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe met US treasury secretary Janet Yellen in Brussels yesterday as pressure mounts on Ireland over this country's opposition to global corporate tax reform proposals. Ireland is one of nine outliers internationally in resisting proposals for a minimum global rate of 15% on corporations. The move is backed by 130 countries worldwide, but Ireland is seeking to maintain its 12.5% rate. Mr Donohoe yesterday said he'd had a 'very good engagement' with the US treasury secretary but that 'we've further work ahead of us across the coming months'. A spokesman for the Finance Minister said Mr Donohoe had maintained his reservations about a global minimum corporate tax rate in the meeting with his US counterpart. 'It was a good and constructive meeting which is part of an ongoing dialogue on the global corporate tax issue,' the spokesman said. He added: 'Minister Donohoe recalled the Irish position on the matter.' Despite Ireland's objections to the current plans, Ms Yellen has said she expects the country to come on board. Mr Varadkar defended Ireland's stance, saying the proposals were not just about 'tax justice' but about 'big countries trying to get a bigger share of the pie'. He said: 'First of all, this stable low corporation tax regime of 12.5% has worked for Ireland. We've taken about (EURO)10billion a year in corporation profit tax, double what the average European country does per head. It's one of those examples of where low taxes result in higher revenues, in a world where wealth capital, labour, corporations are very mobile.' He added: 'We shouldn't be under any illusions about what is going on here. 'This isn't just about tax justice and big companies paying their fair share of tax, although it is about that. This is about big countries trying to get a bigger share of the pie. 'Large countries are trying to gain tax revenues at the expense of smaller countries like Ireland, for example, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and others.' He said larger countries were looking out for their own interests and that Ireland should do the very same. 'Britain has secured a carveout for financial services, in order to protect the City of London,' Mr Varadkar said. 'America has secured commitments that the European Union will not go ahead with tax on digital companies. So, we have to look after our interests too, and we will.' Mr Varadkar said Ireland would prefer to be inside the tax agreement than outside it, and that negotiations on the subject would continue. He added: 'We're not going to sign up to our endorsement agreements; that doesn't protect our fundamental interests in a small country.' The Tánaiste was speaking at the launch of the IDA Ireland annual report for 2020. The IDA has reported investment in the first half of 2021 returning employment creation to pre-pandemic levels, with an associated employment potential of more than 12,530 jobs. IDA chief executive Martin Shanahan said the stability of Ireland's corporate tax rate has boosted investor confidence in the country. He said: 'I think from a client's perspective they continue to have significant confidence in Ireland. That is down to the stability of the taxation regime and rate over many years. That's why we continue to see the numbers in 2020 that we saw, and the numbers now in the first half of 2021. 'We know it is more likely that there will be a global tax framework agreed, rather than less likely, at this point.' Ireland has stated that it can sign up to many aspects of the pact, and Mr Shanahan said the country had opposed moves toward a minimum global tax rate for 'legitimate' reasons. He said: 'It is perfectly legitimate that Ireland would articulate Ireland's case within a global negotiation... There are still political discussions and policy discussions to be had between now and October.' news@dailymail.ie 'It's not just about tax justice' 'Doesn't protect our interests' Graphic   Talks: Janet Yellen and Mr Donohoe yesterday"

The fintech, which had been seen as one of the most ambitious and exciting Irish firms in the banking tech space, has called a meeting of its creditors for July 19. At that meeting it has indicated it will nominate Myles Kirby of Kirby Healy Chartered Accountants as liquidator. Leveris had previously raised (EURO)25m from the Australian financial services firm Link Group in 2018, valuing it at (EURO)190m. Its founder and CEO, Conor Fennelly told the Sunday Independent in an interview this time last year that the firm, which had developed an online banking platform, was seeking to raise a further (EURO)100m. But Fennelly told the Sunday Independent last week that the demise of the firm has come about because a major funding deal fell through. ""As for many companies, Covid-19 has had a material impact on Leveris,"" said Fennelly. ""Since the onset of the pandemic, we experienced a 9- to 12-month delay in our sales pipeline and investment plans.

The unprecedented drain on the power grid could spark an electricity crisis ? with rolling blackouts across the country a possibility by 2026. The Government has rolled out the red carpet in recent years for tech giants to set up data centres, which store everything from emails to social media and Netflix for the entire continent. This policy will drive a demand for power twice that of almost two million people in and around the capital over the next few years ? compared to previous high increases of less than four per cent in the Celtic Tiger boom years. Eirgrid's David Martin told the Irish Sun: ""Imagine day-to-day life without electricity. The worst possible scenario is rolling blackouts, you see it in some countries; South Africa in recent years. ""When you don't have enough capacity you switch the lights off, take power away from one area for two hours and then the next part of the country. ""That's typically how it's managed. If it turns catastrophic that's the kind of scenario you would see."" The race is on to make Ireland 70 per cent renewable by 2030, which means most of our power will be generated by wind or solar. Currently almost 60 per cent of our fuel is fossil fuel generated, and Moneypoint will cease burning coal by 2025 as part of this green drive. It means we are moving into new territory, just as the big guns are using electricity at unprecedented levels. Ireland is the data centre capital of Europe, home to the likes of Google and Microsoft, with 66 centres currently operating, and over 30 more in the pipeline. Amazon have already snapped up three wind farms to generate their own power ? in Cork, Galway and Donegal where associated landslides hit the headlines last year ? while Facebook also have one in the works in Tipperary. Data centres will use up almost 30 per cent of all energy in Ireland by 2028, and experts fear it's no good asking ordinary people to make changes or pay carbon taxes and for rural communities to accept wind farms when the tech behemoths are sapping all the juice. Prof Patrick Bresnihan told the Irish Sun: ""The Government talks about the need for the population to get on board with low carbon. We all have to make little sacrifices, but think of the rural question. ""I live in Sligo, the house I'm renting is oil heated, most of them are. People rely on cars because there's no public transport. ""With carbon taxes you're talking about hitting particularly the rural population. On top of that you've got wind farms which don't benefit local communities, with the energy siphoned off for data centres which don't provide many jobs. ""I mean there are many reasons for the nation, but particularly for rural areas, to feel aggrieved. ""We've seen the likes of the Healy-Raes in Kerry, it's a very easy argument to win, that climate change and environmental action is for the elites and city dwellers. It's a very negative message that will just be amplified if the Government pursues these policies. You're going to lose people this way, and rightly."" He added: ""The domestic user paying for this is a familiar story. The rhetoric is for us all to be more responsible in how we use our energy ? it's all about efficiency. But at the same time you have these tech companies that are coming in and using 30 per cent of supply by 2030. At the same time they pay very little corporation tax. ""The idea they're paying their fair share, it doesn't add up. That's where it hits the ground and that's where there might be pushback. The basic unfairness of it all."" Tech giants aim to be ""100 per cent sustainable"" in their use of electricity ? but Prof Bresnihan isn't convinced. He said: ""A lot of the data centres have come under increasing scrutiny, Amazon especially. ""They're looking for places to locate where they can make the claim they're getting 100 per cent energy from renewable sources. ""Ireland is trying to facilitate that, the likes of Bord na Mona and Coillte see this as one of the few commercial directions they can go in."" Data centre investments form the backbone of Ireland's overall digital economy, but while they employ around 1,900 construction workers a year they do not provide many direct jobs. Prof Bresnihan said: ""A lot of effort has gone into attracting them without thinking being joined up. ""Now Eirgrid, the one semi-state that does have to think in a joined up way, is going, 'Hang on a second, this doesn't really add up'."" Analysis by Eirgrid shows that there may not be adequate capacity to meet demand from 2026 for Ireland should Moneypoint close and long term demand continue to rise ? which it likely will. It says that the closure of any other plants could give rise to shortages even earlier than 2026, and while Mr Martin says rolling blackouts are unlikely, he warned the challenge was unprecedented. He explained: ""The data centre industry is seeking over 3,000 megawatts of capacity to connect to the grid. What's that? It's twice as much as the peak demand for electricity for the greater Dublin area. ""So the demand is going to be double over the coming years looking to connect. ""And that's generally around Dublin, so it's a significant challenge. They are an integral part of the economy, central to inward investment. Are they a challenge? Absolutely, but our remit is to offer connection to them so we have to get on with it."" He added: ""Some of the data centres are looking to offset their use of electricity by investing in wind farms, that's good as it increases the amount of renewable energy on the system. It does help."" The Eirgrid spokesman says there will soon be an explosion in solar options to back up the wind energy. Ireland can also rely on interconnectors to the UK and Europe, which means that when things are tight we can import our energy. But Maynooth University's Prof Bresnihan isn't happy. He worries about what happens when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine, and the lack of a firm solution means power will be backed up by gas or diesel well into the future. He said: ""What about all the new demands on electricity? The million e-cars they hope to have on the roads? Our existing demand plus demand of transport sector plus demand of data centres, it doesn't add up and Eirgrid have made it clear they have concerns about the security of supply up to 2030."" And he believes it's rural dwellers picking up the slack for demand in Dublin. He said: ""There has been a lot of opposition in rural Ireland to wind farms. Talk to people with wind farms going up, and there will be a lot more if we're to double onshore capacity. ""If the tech companies can directly buy that they can bypass existing requirements for community development funds. ""Who is the energy for? Who is it impacting negatively? Rural communities for the most part."" A spokesperson at the Department of the Environment said: ""Data centres are part of the core infrastructure of the digital economy. They have become increasingly important in the context of remote working during the pandemic and also support high-quality jobs. ""Ireland has significant ambitions to ensure that at least 70 per cent of our electricity demand will be met by renewable sources by 2030, in particular through offshore wind. This will help supply the growing demand from data centres. ""The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so it can carry significantly more renewable generation and meet increasing demand from high-volume users. ""All customers connecting to the grid are required to pay for the operation and maintenance of the transmission system on a long term basis.""

Ministers will be briefed on a review of the Lobbying Act, prompted by controversy after former minister of State for financial services Michael D'Arcy left to head the Irish Association of Investment Managers. Under changes proposed by Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath , it will be an offence not to comply with so-called ""cooling-off"" rules after ministers and senior officials leave office. The Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) had previously sought sanctions, pointing to examples where it has previously been satisfied that rules had been breached, but it had no powers to act. The changes will make it an offence to fail to register or submit lobbying returns to Sipo, and will extend the legislation's scope to govern unpaid lobbying by individuals. Bodies that lobby but do not have employees, such as representative organisations, must register too, while members will have to be named on lobbying returns to ensure that proper records are kept. Mr D'Arcy's appointment to the investment managers' association later saw Taoiseach Micheál Martin saying that he was ""not happy"" with people taking up jobs in areas where they previously had a political role.

Farming outside Tubber, Moate, but in Offaly, on over 200 acres of fragmented land, most of it owned, Cormac says a docile animal is more important. ""I've been farming for years and am 60 now and (the look of them) doesn't bother me,"" he says. ""I've had really good-looking cattle down the years and currently have 14 U-grade continentals in a field. ""They are two-year-old heifers and it's not simple to get them in or handle them. They can be dangerous at times. ""On the same bit of land, I have others that would come over and follow you out the gate and lick your hand. There is beauty in that as well, and that's why I am going with them"". Cormac farms with his wife Bernadette, and their three sons help out at weekends, but he is winding down the number of suckler cows from 50 a few years ago by not buying replacements. He also keeps 80 ewes and sold 41 lambs last week via the Offaly Lamb Producer Group. Dotted With only 40ac of his farm next to the house, Cormac is kept busy between the six other parcels of land, dotted around the parish, and herding can take two-and-a-half hours every day. He joined the Twenty20 Beef Club in 2019, a dairy calf-to beef production system aiming to improve economic, social and environmental sustainability. Through the scheme - a partnership between Glanbia Ireland and Kepak Group - Cormac has seen the number of calves he's bought in increase to 115 this year, along with 35 from his own suckler herd. ""The first year I reared 50 calves plus 40 of my own and last year 87 plus my own,"" he says. ""I'll be completely out of suckler cows in the next few years and this suits me. The docility of the calves makes things a lot safer. ""When the scheme started, I was buying fertiliser and meal from Glanbia, so it was a natural fit to go into it."" Cormac buys in calves, between three and five weeks old, and sells them at 20 and 22 months. ""The biggest issue is finding people to buy from. Part of the scheme is that the animal cannot stand in a mart at any time in its life, as animal welfare is a big part of this scheme,"" he says. ""You have to buy calves directly, so this year I sourced calves in Athy, Cavan and Edenderry, as well as from some local farmers. Last year I went to Kilkenny, Laois and Cavan to get calves. ""Hopefully I can go back to some of those men again, but if you are travelling for calves, you need a good Jeep and trailer. ""There is a nice bit of work of rearing 115 calves - feeding meal and keeping everything healthy and keeping an eye on them. It may not be for everyone. It's time-consuming but it's not dangerous."" Of the 115 heifers and bull calves he's rearing, most are by Angus and Hereford bulls. Cormac is killing the heifers at 20 months, with an average carcass weight of 290kg, while the bullocks are killed at 22 months, around 330kg. Most killed out at O= and at 52pc, according to Cormac, which he was happy with. ""I weighed them before I killed them and O= was the average grade and 52pc is good for these kind of cattle,"" he says. ""Top continentals might make 55-60pc, but in this scheme you have to be prepared that the cattle will disappoint you in kill out and grading."" According to the scheme, the benefits for farmers are numerous and include a substantial price premium for the cattle, predictability of pricing and certainty around their market. Members are offered technical support to enable them to produce or procure animals with higher genetic merit and achieve optimum daily live-weight gain during the animal's life. Docility The main advantage, Cormac says, is the docility of the animals and expert advice he receives from both Glanbia and Kepak. ""The reps are really good. They come out and advise you on feeding and grassland,"" he says. ""Having a relationship with a factory is good. A lot of farmers don't have that, but in this scheme they will come out and look at the cattle and advise me how best to finish them. It's very important to have a relationship with anyone you are doing business with. I never dealt with an agent, always with the factory, but this scheme allows me to deal with the procurement scheme in Kepak. ""I'm always trying to do everything a bit better than before. I've introduced ad-lib feeding after weaning and it's helped stop setbacks - that was based on advice I received. ""The biggest thing for me is the docility as suckler cattle are not always easy to handle. These follow you around the field."" According to Mick O'Dowd, Agri-Business Development Manager with Kepak, the scheme provides a guaranteed market for dairy beef calves with a premium for farmers. ""The way the pricing works, when the first cattle were processed last September/October, the base price was below (EURO)3.75/kg. The premium then was 25c/kg over and above any QA bonus or breed bonus. ""As the price rose over (EURO)3.80kg, the premium reduced to 15c/kg, but it doesn't drop below 15c/kg. The minimum pricing may not be relevant right now, but last autumn the price of cattle was down around (EURO)3.55/kg. If it goes below (EURO)3.50/kg, there is a minimum price built in. ""We want farmers achieving every single bonus that is available and it means the product is coming through consistently for us and they are duly rewarded.""

Dozens were reported killed as grievances unleashed by the jailing of former president Jacob Zuma boiled over into the worst violence in years. Protests that followed Zuma's arrest last week have widened into looting and an outpouring of generalised anger over inequality that persists 27 years after the fall of apartheid. Poverty has been exacerbated by severe social and economic restrictions aimed at blocking the spread of Covid-19. Security officials said the government was working to halt the spread of violence and looting, which has so far spread from Zuma's home in KwaZulu-Natal province to Gauteng province surrounding the country's biggest city, Johannesburg. They deployed soldiers to the streets to try to contain it, but stopped short of declaring a state of emergency. ""No amount of unhappiness or personal circumstances from our people gives the right to anyone to loot, vandalise and do as they please and break the law,"" Police Minister Bheki Cele told a news conference, echoing sentiments expressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa overnight. The bodies of 10 people were found on Monday evening after a stampede at a Soweto shopping mall, premier David Makhura said. Hundreds of looters raided warehouses and supermarkets in Durban, one of the busiest shipping terminals on the African continent and a major import-export hub. Outside a Durban warehouse of retailer Game, looters were filmed stuffing cars with electronic goods and clothes. Inside, the floor was a mess of discarded packaging as the crowd systematically emptied shelves. Aerial footage from local news channel eNCA showed black smoke rising from several warehouses, while debris lay strewn. Troops were moving into flashpoints yesterday as outnumbered police seemed helpless to stop the unrest. Columns of armoured personnel carriers rolled down highways. The rand, which had been one of the best performing emerging market currencies during the pandemic, dropped to a three-month low yesterday, and local and hard currency bonds suffered. At least 45 people have so far been killed during the unrest, 19 in Gauteng and 26 in Kwa-Zulu-Natal, according to state and provincial authorities. Police Minister Cele put the official death toll at 10. On the streets, protesters hurled stones at police who responded with rubber bullets. In Soweto, police and military were patrolling as shop owners assessed the damage. Mr Cele said 757 people had been arrested so far. He said the government would act to prevent it from spreading further and warned that people would not be allowed ""to make a mockery of our democratic state"". Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, speaking at the same news conference, said she did not think a state of emergency should be imposed yet. Zuma (79) was sentenced last month for defying a constitutional court order to give evidence at an inquiry investigating high-level corruption during his nine years in office.. The legal proceedings have been seen as a test of post-apartheid South Africa's ability to enforce the rule of law. But any confrontation with soldiers risks fuelling charges by Zuma and his supporters that they are victims of a politically motivated crackdown by his successor, Mr Ramaphosa. The violence worsened as Zuma challenged his 15-month jail term in South Africa's top court on Monday. Judgement was reserved until an unspecified date. The deteriorating situation pointed to wider problems and unfulfilled expectations that followed the end of white minority rule in 1994. The economy is struggling to emerge from the damage wrought by Africa's worst Covid-19 epidemic, with authorities repeatedly imposing restrictions on businesses.

Instead, 37-year-old Liam Duggan died from multiple organ failure due to septicaemia, leaving his wife Catherine and two young children 'shattered'. A High Court case taken by his widow against the HSE was settled yesterday, following mediation by Eugene Gleeson SC, for what her lawyers, HOMS Assist, described as a 'substantial' six-figure sum. Judge Paul Coffey heard an apology to Catherine Duggan from the HSE, written by Fearghal Grimes, general manager of University Hospital Kerry. He stated: 'University Hospital Kerry would like to acknowledge the deficits of care which resulted in the untimely death of your husband and father Liam. We recognise that his loss has had a profound and devastating effect on you and your family.' Mr Grimes added: 'I wish to offer my heartfelt apologies for the shortcomings in the care provided and for the distress suffered by you, Jack, seven, and Amelia, five.' The ruling of the settlement by the court marked the end of a prolonged, four-year legal battle by Ms Duggan, 39, of Ballymacelligott, Tralee, Co. Kerry, to find answers and fight for justice for her husband, whose children were just one and three years old when he died. Mr Duggan was a PGA advanced golf professional, who was posthumously awarded the President's Award for Golf Development in recognition of his tireless work to develop golf in schools and promoting inclusivity in Ireland. On March 18, 2017, Mr Duggan had gone to University Hospital Kerry complaining of abdominal pain with vomiting and diarrhoea. He had a high temperature and was diagnosed with sepsis and given a number of treatments; however, he was discharged on April 3, while he was still symptomatic. The HSE did not admit liability in the case, but did admit that there was a breach of care in a failure to perform a repeat abdominal CT scan to investigate Mr Duggan's condition before his discharge from hospital. It was said by Ms Duggan's medical experts that if a scan had been carried out in late March, it would have shown that his colon was seriously inflamed and he would not have been discharged. They claimed that on balance, surgery would then have been performed sooner, and before he became critically ill. This surgery would have been curative, they said. However, nine days later, on April 12, he was once again admitted via the hospital's emergency department with severe abdominal pain. He was vomiting with diarrhoea, high temperature, high pulse and clear evidence of sepsis. He was gravely ill and was transferred to Cork University Hospital two days later. His condition deteriorated further and he died on May 9. In a statement outside court yesterday, his heartbroken widow said: 'The tragic loss of Jack and Amelia's dad at such an early age, especially when that loss should not have happened, left both children shattered. 'Children should not have to face a tragedy like this. Liam adored Jack and Amelia. He was such a family man who was loved so much. His life revolved around both of them.' Ms Duggan was critical of the mismanagement of her husband's care, and the painful and prolonged battle for answers since his death. An inquest ruled that he had died from natural causes. 'I hope by bringing awareness today that it might save someone else's life,' she said. 'The whole system and ordeal of having to face an inquest where the truth was not told - and in my opinion covered up from the start - has been utterly devastating for me and my children. 'We have had to fight tooth and nail to bring justice for Liam who should have been in the prime of his life.' Ms Duggan continued: 'We have fought hard the last four years to get to today. The HSE's mistakes have had a lifechanging effect on Liam's family and friends, who hopefully after today can get some peace from this decision and bring closure to them. After a four-year legal battle, I hope that Liam gets to rest in peace.' Solicitor Rachael O'Shaughnessy praised her client for her perseverance, saying: 'Catherine has been exceptionally brave throughout this really painful process. 'I first met Catherine when she was recently widowed and her determination to get answers during what has been an uphill battle has been an inspiration. 'Despite no open disclosure from the University Hospital Kerry and despite no answers from the inquest, Catherine has been relentless in her quest to find out what happened to her husband, Liam. 'It is as a result of Catherine's bravery and conviction and asking the right questions on behalf of her husband, herself and her children that I believe we are standing here today.' She added: 'It is so desperately sad that two young children have been left without a father, Catherine without a loving husband and a local community without an immense talent.' helen.bruce@dailymail.ie HSE admitted a breach of care 'We have had to fight for justice' Graphic   Tragedy: Liam Duggan died from multiple organ failureBattle: Catherine Duggan outside the Four Courts yesterday"

Proposals from Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien would mean annual rent rises will be based on inflation rates instead of set caps. Current laws mean rents within rent pressure zones (RPZs) can only rise by a maximum of 4pc annually. Under the new rules, which will run until 2024, there will be no cap on rent increases and instead rents will only be allowed to go up in line with general inflation, as recorded in the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The European Central Bank (ECB) aims to keep inflation at or close to 2pc across member states. If the 2pc calculation is applied this means tenants would see the annual rise in their rent halved. However trade disruption and global shortages of all kinds of goods coming out of the pandemic have kicked off a sharp rise in inflation this year, prompting speculation that the era of super-low inflation is ending. There had been almost no inflation over the past decade, despite the ECB wanting to see it running at close to 2pc. However, that target now looks like it may be surpassed this year. The RTB's latest rent index covering the months between October and December shows the average rent in Dublin now stands at (EURO)1,745 a month. With the existing legislation and caps of 4pc, people living in RPZs would have to pay increases of up to (EURO)70, meaning they would pay (EURO)1,815 monthly next year. However, as the current inflation rate is 1.9pc across countries in the eurozone, this would mean rents rising by (EURO)33, so they would pay (EURO)1,778 a month next year. Senior lecturer in housing at Technological University Dublin Dr Lorcan Sirr, told the Irish Independent that while rent increases based on inflation have been urged for some time there is still a need for a cap. ""The principle of linking rent increases to inflation is a good one, and has long been called for. However, timing is everything and this change comes at a time when inflation is beginning to rise and rents aren't falling,"" he said. ""If inflation continues to rise, and hopefully it won't, it would be useful to see a cap placed on the ultimate increase no matter what rate the HICP is. It will be interesting to see what impact this new rent indexing will have on institutional investors' appetite for the Irish market."" A spokesperson for Mr O'Brien said the new measures will be kept under review. The changes are expected to kick in by July 9 after the passing of the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021. Mr O'Brien said the 4pc cap on rent increases has become a ""target rather than a limit"". ""We are now taking action to ensure that tenants will only pay rent increases, if required to, which are in line with general inflation, which is currently below 2pc."" He said linking rent increases with inflation would protect the ""property rights of landlords"" and also ensure ""continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords"". The new legislation will also restrict upfront payments for renters when first securing a tenancy. To secure a home, tenants will now not have to pay more than two months' rent - this would normally include one month's rent and a deposit."

Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien insisted the move was necessary to ensure the delivery of up to 2,400 homes through leasing arrangements were not put at risk. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe made the same argument late last night as he tabled the amendment which he said aimed ""to ensure the supply of more social housing as quickly as possible"". The amendment was passed by 74 votes to 59 with no abstentions. The Government had the support of just one Regional Independent TD while all Opposition parties and other Independents rejected it. Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, accused Mr Martin of ""hijacking"" the Finance Bill with a ""sneaky amendment"" to incentivise cuckoo funds to ""snap up"" complete estates, a charge the Government denied. Delivery  Mr Martin argued that the delivery of up to 2,400 social housing units through leasing by funds to local authorities could be jeopardised if the lower stamp duty rate was not reinstated for such arrangements. He said that ""if we turn off the tap immediately"", families on the housing list could lose out. He asked Ms McDonald ""should they be left on the street or in unacceptable conditions?"" Mr Martin also signalled the State would ""transition to different models"" including one where the State would end up owning leased properties.  The issue of bulk buying housing shot to the top of the political agenda in May when a housing estate in Maynooth, Co Kildare, was purchased by an investment fund. Stamp duty was increased from 1 per cent to 10 per cent on the purchase of 10 or more houses over 12 months.  Mr Martin said at the time no local authority should be engaging in a long lease with institutional investors, although he acknowledged that ""a limited degree of leasing has some importance"".  The Opposition accused him of doing a U-turn on these remarks. "

He almost got it done, toughing out a winter of transport strikes in 2019-2020 and then having former prime minister Édouard Philippe pass the reform by decree in the National Assembly on March 1st, 2020. Two weeks later, France went into its first Covid-19 lockdown. Instead of moving on to the Senate and back to the Assembly for a second reading, the law on pension reform was frozen. The original law has been abandoned, but pension reform is thawing. Its resumption ""is not a question of if but when"", says government spokesman Gabriel Attal.  Macron's entourage - like the country itself - is divided between ""frugals"", led by finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who want the reform to go ahead this autumn, and ""prudents"", including the speaker of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand and François Bayrou, a Macron ally and leader of a small centrist party, who say it is urgent to hurry up and wait. The dilemma is stark. If Macron stalls on the reform, conservatives will accuse him of lacking political courage and being a spendthrift. If he goes ahead with it, he risks provoking strikes and mass demonstrations. 'Madness'  Macron met France's social partners at the Élysée Palace yesterday to discuss a possible relaunch of the aborted reform. No announcements were made, but Laurent Berger, the head of the CFDT, France's largest trade union, said he and seven other trade union leaders ""were almost unanimous. We told the president that making the pension reform in the autumn would be madness"". Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, the head of the business management group Medef, who also attended the meeting, said, ""The president reminded us that all countries have done this type of reform, but he did not reveal his intentions.""  Medef favours raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 in the hope of reducing budget deficits but advocates postponing the measure until after the April 2022 presidential election, because social unrest could impede France's post-Covid recovery. Macron's notoriously poor relations with Berger are not helping him to resolve the pension dilemma.  Berger supported Macron's original promise of a ""systemic"" reform of pensions which would have reduced France's 42 different pension regimes to a single, universal system in which salaried employees would have accumulated points. The idea of a ""parametric"" reform in which parameters - mainly the retirement age - would be altered was always anathema to Berger. Now Macron has abandoned all thought of a systemic reform in favour of raising the retirement age to 64, say media reports. He is following the advice of the Tirole-Blanchard report, commissioned by Macron and published last month.  The Nobel prize-winning economist Jean Tirole and Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, said the proposed reform was so difficult to understand that they were unable to calculate their own pension benefits. Public debt  Macron's original reform was intended to make pensions more equitable, not necessarily to save money. But France's ""whatever it takes"" strategy of shoring up the economy through the pandemic has raised public expenditure more than five percentage points, to 61.8 per cent of GDP. Public debt has increased by EUR 487 billion during Macron's term. ""The Great Reformer"" has become ""The Great Spender"", says the conservative weekly Le Point. Pensions consume a quarter of all public expenditure in France, or 14.7 per cent of GDP. Raising the retirement age by two years would reap huge savings. An Ifop poll published last month showed that 72 per cent of members of Macron's La République en Marche and 70 per cent of those in the conservative party Les Républicains want him to relaunch pension reform. By doing so, he would steal a march on the future LR presidential candidate, possibly Xavier Bertrand. But in a more recent BVA poll, 66 per cent of respondents opposed raising the retirement age.  The extreme right-wing leader Marine Le Pen, who may face Macron in the presidential run-off next April, promises to lower the retirement age to 60. Macron is dragging out his decision, as he often does. He will probably make a major speech before Bastille Day in which he will outline plans for the remaining 10 months of his first term, and give indications of what he will do if he wins a second five-year term. He is expected to use uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant as a pretext to delay his decision on pension reform.  One likely scenario is an announcement in the autumn of the modalities of the reform, while postponing its adoption until after the presidential election."

The requirement, like President Emmanuel Macron's speech on Monday night, is a foretaste of life in France for months to come.  Macron wants to make things so difficult for anti-vaxxers that they give up. Healthcare workers not vaccinated by September 15th will lose their jobs. Health passes will be required at cultural and entertainment venues from July 21st, and to enter cafes, restaurants, shopping centres and transport from August 1st. Julien Aubert, a parliamentary deputy from the conservative party Les Républicains, said extensive use of the health pass amounts to de facto compulsory vaccination of the entire population. The far right-wing leader Marine Le Pen called the new Covid regulations ""a serious deterioration of individual freedoms"" and labelled Macron's stated intention to reform the pension system ""the liquidation of our system of social protection"". Jean-Frédéric Poisson, who heads a small Christian-democratic party, denounced Macron's ""liberticide delirium and election campaign demagogy"". Such statements could backfire. A poll published by Le Figaro yesterday indicates that 67 per cent of the French support the main measures announced by Macron.  Resistance to vaccination has declined - from 58 per cent last December to 30 per cent in April, according to the Statista website.  Accepting constraints A population weary of curfews and lockdowns now appears willing to accept constraints in exchange for a degree of normality. ""I solemnly appeal to all our unvaccinated compatriots to go out and get vaccinated as quickly as possible,"" Macron exhorted the French. ""Nine million doses are waiting for you . . . Get vaccinated. It's the only way to protect yourselves and to protect others."" More than 1.3 million people made appointments to be vaccinated via the Doctolib website in the hours following Macron's speech. Throughout the pandemic, Macron said, he has ""constantly sought balance between protection and freedom"".  Only 2½ months ago, he promised that ""the health pass will never grant a right to access that differentiates among French people"".  That was before the Delta variant and the threat of a fourth wave. Only one country - the central Asian dictatorship in Turkmenistan - has made vaccination mandatory for all adults, the British Medical Journal reports.  But compulsory vaccination may be the wave of the future.  The UK has required vaccination of frontline healthcare workers since last month, before Macron. Countries as varied as Fiji, Greece, Kazakhstan, Latvia and Saudi Arabia have conditioned employment in many fields on the acceptance of vaccination.  The US bank Morgan Stanley has barred all but fully vaccinated staff and clients from its New York offices. Macron's speech was unofficially the first of his re-election campaign. He devoted more than half the 30-minute address to his own record in office and plans for the future.  The backdrop of the Eiffel Tower was a strong visual symbol.  The speech was more direct, comprehensible and shorter than many of Macron's past discourses. Macron came across as cheerful, firm and determined in the face of adversity, despite the fact that his first term as president has often felt like one interminable crisis.  The scandal surrounding his former bodyguard Alexandre Benalla in 2017 was followed by the revolt of the yellow vests in 2018-2019, transport strikes over pension reform in 2019-2020 and, for the last 16 months, the Covid pandemic. Before he announced the new anti-Covid measures, Macron vaunted his handling of the epidemic.  French children missed only 12 weeks of school, compared with 56 weeks in the US and 34 weeks in Germany, he noted. His policy of ""whatever it costs"" has ""protected our companies, our jobs and the purchasing power of many French people"". Though he did not say so, it has also raised deficit spending to a whopping 9.4 per cent of GDP. Portraying himself as the proverbial safe pair of hands, Macron said that ""these choices and these results enable us to take on the difficulties that are still before us with determination"". Macron's patriotic tone - ""We are a great nation, a nation of science, of the Enlightenment, of Louis Pasteur"" - was also redolent of the campaign trail. Spending pledges Over the remaining nine months of his term, Macron promised to concentrate EUR 100 billion in economic recovery funds on fighting climate change. He says he will remedy shortages of wood, steel, iron and semi conductors, as well as labour. He will use the French presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2022 ""to build a shared agenda for industrial and technological independence"". (The words ""from China"" were understood.) In rhetoric reminiscent of Nicolas Sarkozy's 2007 campaign, Macron said ""this French social model rests on a foundation: work . . . In France, one must always earn a better living by working than by staying at home, which is not always the case today."" By referring to an upcoming investment plan ""to build the France of 2030"", Macron seemed to project himself into a second, 2022-2027 term in office. He wants France, and Europe, to be ""the champions of tomorrow in digital technology, green industry, biotechnology and agriculture"". Macron's reform of unemployment insurance will take effect on October 1st. Also this autumn, he intends to launch a ""revenue of commitment"" for unemployed youths, and increase support for the elderly and the handicapped. ""We will retake control of our destiny as a nation . . . We have a rendezvous with our future,"" said Macron the presidential candidate."

The Hoops were undone by a goal in each half by Slovan Bratislava's Brazilian attacker Rafael Ratao and the Irish side sensed a chance to pull a goal back at the death when pouring bodies into the area for a dead ball. However, in a theme that ran through a game played in draining conditions, the League of Ireland champions' final ball was poor and it provided Slovan with a chance to counter. Vladimir Weiss, who has just returned from Euros duty with Slovakia, was deemed to have been fouled in the area by the back-tracking Ronan Finn although the away side were furious. Brilliant Former Man City and Rangers winger Weiss took the resultant spot-kick but Mannus was alert to make a brilliant save that allowed the visitors to finish the game in good spirits. ""At 3-0 it's game over, but I think at 2-0 it gives you a chance to stay in the tie,"" said Bradley. The removal of the away-goals rule means they need a two-goal win of any description in Tallaght next Tuesday to send the tie to extra-time. Under the old rules, a concession of any description next week would have left them needing four goals. Bradley's unseeded side will need to be much better going forward, though, as they struggled to pull a decent Slovan outfit out of shape in the final third. The real frustration for Rovers was the silly goal conceded at the start of the second half which really left them with an uphill task. It was a sickening concession for the Irish side who had competed reasonably well in the first half, although they went in behind following a goal after a spell of Slovan pressure. Ball retention is a strength of Bradley's side on the domestic scene but they aren't usually pressed by an opponent of this quality and they made life difficult for themselves in sweltering conditions by struggling to make the ball stick up top. Rovers did actually have the best chance in the opening spell with Seán Gannon rushing his shot following a brilliant team move capped by a Liam Scales pass. Despite their best efforts, the away side struggled to create a chance of that quality for the remainder. They fell behind just after a brilliant Roberto Lopes block had prevented the hosts from opening the scoring. Slovan came knocking again with a diagonal pass to left-full Vernon de Marco stretching Gannon and resulting in a cross that was dispatched by the head of Ratao. ""It was really poor,"" said Bradley, ""We need to do more to affect the cross and then it's a free header six yards from goal."" Replays suggested Mannus, who seemed to be bothered by the low sun, could have done better with judging the flight of the ball. He would atone for that later. They would have emerged from the interval feeling there were opportunities they could exploit but they were instead pegged back for a painfully soft concession a minute after the restart with Ratao capitalising on ponderous defending with Rovers switching off when it seemed as though the ball was about to go out of play. ""That was the most frustrating thing because we said at half-time that we needed to start right, because we knew they'd come out quick, which always happens away in Europe,"" added Bradley. Bradley has been affected by injuries in recent weeks and made a treble switch, sending for Danny Mandroiu, Graham Burke and Dylan Watts in an attempt to inject guile to their play. It resulted in better passages of play without necessarily stressing out the locals. Slovan were content to soak up pressure and break and sub Weiss squandered an opportunity to add a third with Mannus alert to the attempted dink. The Northern Irishman would win the next battle too, but Rovers need to find another gear in the return to make Weiss pay for that profligacy.

The decision attracted inevitable criticism on social media, but the decision to postpone the race for a consecutive year was due to the level of organisation required months in advance, and trying to do so with huge doubts about the reopening of significant sections of society. Comments from race director, Jim Aughney, intimated as much. 'We have come to a critical point in our event planning when a final decision needed to be made,' said Aughney. 'We took into consideration the recent updates on modelling around Covid- 19 and the immense challenges of creating a controlled, safe environment for the KBC Dublin Marathon which has a footprint of 26.2 miles, with 25,000 runners and 200,000 supporters who line the streets to cheer them on.' All entries for this year's event are valid for 2022, but entrants can also choose to seek a refund, up to July 31. The news was also announced this far in advance for another obvious practical reason: runners who had planned to compete in the marathon on the Halloween Bank Holiday weekend would have started their training, and rather than devote the next three and a half months to preparations for a race that could not be guaranteed, the decision was taken early. 'Despite vigorous evaluations, there are still too many unknowns to be confident that we could provide a safe event given the pure scale of the marathon,' explained Aughney. 'We have a duty of care to the runners, volunteers, suppliers and supporters. This will be extremely disappointing news for all participants entered. We want to thank them for their continued support.' 'Decision was taken Graphic   2019 win: Othmane El Goumri"

Fears that Ulster football had gone continental and devil-may-care evaporated yesterday over 74 minutes that have saved the reputation of the All-Ireland championship. For the past few weeks, the big tournament has been reduced to a series of eviscerations: games that were over before they began. This one was still up for grabs deep in injury time when Donegal's Patrick McBrearty gave Chrissy McKeigue the slip for the first time all afternoon and thumped a murderous left-footed point into the dull northwest afternoon. Derry had one last attack but couldn't work enough space to get a shot off and so ended one of the best ever games in this northwest derby. From the beginning, the contest gave lie to the gap between the divisions: here was a team climbing out of Division Three attacking a residual Division One team with fearless imagination and a highly finessed game plan.  Rory Gallagher almost orchestrated a perfect coup against his former team and his county of domicile. Opportunities will replay themselves in the minds of the Derry men over the coming weeks: Benny Heron's palmed open goal that hit the crossbar in the 39th minute: a point blank shot at goal which Shane McGuigan somehow turned wide. Against that: what a performance.  Padraig Cassidy was uncontainable with his direct ball carrying strides along the left wing while Conor Glass and Brendan Rogers set the mood for Derry in the physical exchanges. Some of their shot taking was of the highest calibre and their work rate and organisation blunted the looping, overlapping Donegal attacking style. There was a sense that Derry might 'do something' here but nobody knew until the game began. The first 20 minutes did little to diminish Martin McHugh's claim that Rory Gallagher has one of the best brains in Gaelic football. From the beginning Gallagher's voice dominated the overcast afternoon as he moved his players as though on a chess board in regimental commands.  Comfort zone  Training ground work shone through the proceedings. The Donegalmen were dragged from their comfort zone straight away. Accustomed to leisurely flinging the ball around as they approached the opposition 50, they now found themselves harried by a mutating Oak Leaf press.  With Michael Murphy not starting - his first absence from a Donegal championship starting 15 since the All-Ireland quarter final of 2011 - Donegal simply refused to try and kick long over the press and looked uncertain in the opening 10 minutes. When Derry got the ball, they were stunningly direct, with the big-lunged Cassidy and fullback Brendan Rogers sprinting into the last third while Gallagher urged the weak side players - midfielder Conor Glass and forwards Ciaran McFaul and Paul Cassidy to stay wide and stretch the Donegal cover.  They hit the post and should have had a penalty in the sixth minute when Shane McGuigan was scythed by Stephen McMenamin. A series of superb point taking pushed them into a 0-6 to 0-2 lead after 22 minutes. Derry cheers dominated the small crowd of 500 as Donegal posted morale sapping wides. Two brilliant points by Ciaran McFaul and then another fine strike by Emmet Bradley gave Derry a 0-12 to 0-8 lead after 50 minutes: a perfect position. As the Derry crowd celebrated, Murphy checked in and steadied local nerves with a free.  But it was the introduction of Odhran MacNiallais which turned things. The Gweedore man is such a silky, elusive talent and along with Niall O'Donnell, Caolan McGonigle and Michael Langan led Donegal back to lighted territory. O'Donnell had his best game in a Donegal shirt and struck two exceptional points in the face of heated Derry cover. Momentum  Paul Brennan also turned the momentum with a brilliant turnover on a Derry counter attack and he then followed the play upfield to land a brilliant point in the 51st minute when Donegal were listing slightly. The Tyrone management were among the small crowd in Ballybofey. They will have noted the eagerness with which Derry's inside forwards, vocally encouraged by Gallagher, turned to 'go at' their markers. Yet again Donegal coughed up goal chances here before plugging holes over the final quarter of the game. Maybe it was during those nerve-wracking last 10 minutes when Donegal's experience began to show. Derry have not won an Ulster championship since 2015. A free by Shane McGuigan free brought the afternoon to the brink of extra time before Donegal came forward again, working their ball steadily towards the coming figure of McBrearty, who turned onto his left.  The connection was as sweet at it gets. Gallagher lowered his head even as the football began to spiral: he has seen the Kilcar man enough times to know when the shot is true. So Donegal roll on with all kinds of question marks dangling over their All-Ireland - and indeed - Ulster credentials. They played in patches here and required flashes of individual brilliance to prevent what would have been a famous win for Derry. A cruel defeat but a bright future.

More of a saver, which definitely relates to the way and the times in which I was brought up. For our generation, borrowing on the ""never never"" was a no, no. You saved, then you spent. Do you shop around for better value? A little, but I would be very far from prudent when it comes to shopping. What has been your most extravagant purchase and how much did it cost? My first house in Caherdavin in Limerick, back in the day - in the late 1970s, to be precise. It seemed like mission impossible, given a standard 17.25 per cent mortgage interest rate at the time. To procure the £19,500 asking price necessitated breaking the bank. What purchase have you made that you consider the best value for money? A much more recent purchase that rubber-stamps health as unquestioned wealth relates to Oticon More advanced hearing aids from Hidden Hearing. They are almost beyond valuation and certainly the best value for money for me. How do you prefer to shop during the Covid-19 restrictions - online or local? Here again, I am old school: it's local every time. And, strange to relate, I do actually enjoy shopping, provided it is outside of peak hours. Do you haggle over prices? I would love to boast in the affirmative, but I'd be lying. I couldn't barter to save my life. Has the Covid-19 crisis changed your spending habits? No, other than reinforcing the pleasure of dining out. Again, eating out was something unheard of growing up, but now, particularly post-lockdown, it is most definitely one of the social pleasures in life to be treasured. Do you invest in shares? There was one attempt along the way when the rush for gold was to Eircom. It resulted in the Eircom share fiasco. Need I elaborate? Once bitten. . . Cash or card? Predominantly card. What was the last thing you bought and was it good value for money? A top of the range pair of air-cooled memory foam walking shoes, along with a new swim cap, to keep my Greystones regime of a walk and daily swim up to scratch. Now that's what I call shrewd investment - also known as good value for money. Have you ever successfully saved for a big purchase? When I was 17, going into sixth year, I spent that summer working in two jobs. It was PMPA in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin, by day - alongside Eamon Coghlan in the file room - and Bord na gCon (the dogs) by night in Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park.  The goal was £50 to purchase my first ever motor bike from Duffy Motorcycles in Walkinstown. I succeeded in heading back to school on my Yammy (Yamaha) 50. Easy Rider had nothing on me. Have you ever lost money? As in mislaying cash? A few wallets have definitely gone missing over the years. Are you a gambler and, if so, have you ever had a big win? No, no, and definitively no. I wouldn't know one end of a betting slip from the other. As for wins, not even a teeny-weeny-itsy-bitsy pin sticker of a success. Is money important to you? Only in terms of making ends meet. House mortgage apart, I was brought up on the ethic that saving alone led to buying. So the objective, even in the toughest of financial times and specifically the 1980s, was to cover all essential family outgoings.  Family holidays didn't enter the equation until 1994 and that was special. How much money do you have on you now? EUR 155. Four notes - three EUR 50s and one EUR 5.

I thought somehow writing out that number would lessen the impact of time's passing. It didn't. It was 35 years - three-and-a-half decades - ago. Before that, of course, they played to a crowd of 80,000 at Slane Castle in the lashing rain. I was in that crowd. It was my first proper outdoor concert. I had been allowed to go on a date to the RDS a while before to see Chris de Burgh, but the boy never showed up and, to be honest, although I was gutted at the rejection, I wanted to hear Spanish Train more and, vitally, I held the tickets. There's nothing sadder than bopping on your own, but a kind 'elderly' couple (they must have been nearly 40) took pity on me and minded me throughout the evening. I wasn't taking any chances with Queen. I've loved them since the first time I ever heard Freddie's extraordinary register-sweeping vibrato on Somebody to Love. I think Brian May is probably the best guitarist on the planet, and the immense array of songs, from the gut-wrenching Love of my Life to the heart-thumping Seven Seas of Rhye, which I still want played at my funeral and which, oddly, reminds me of my grandfather. I have a strong memory of him crooning to me as a child to I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside, which forms the synth outro on the rock anthem. I always wait for it. The first step in getting to Slane on that July day was affording the IR£15 ticket price. A tall order, I scrimped and saved. I corralled a reliable school friend to go, and the bus journey was interminable. We walked miles to the venue, drenched. Festival virgins, we brought no umbrella, proper clothing or boots. We spent the day on the upper hill, ducked under plastic sheets, alternately soaked to the skin, shivering and sweating. The Bangles supported. They were only five years formed, but Manic Monday had hit the charts that year. A brilliant set, Susanna Hoffs, terrified she was going to be electrocuted in the rain, called for carpets to be pulled over the cables. If girl bands were going to become a 1980s thing, it was a tough act to follow. I'm told Chris Rea was on afterwards, but I have no memory of it. Perhaps I was trying to flag down an illegal pint or find a loo. I've been to some super gigs since then, although I consider myself to have a pedestrian taste in music. Middle of the road, that's me. I've seen Elton John bashing it out on dual grand pianos with Billy Joel; Rod Stewart lashing footballs into the crowd while I sobbed through I Don't Wanna Talk About It; I've been to every concert James Taylor has performed here and even took a guilty pleasure trip to the MEN arena in Manchester to see the Osmonds - even then Donny was looking as gorgeous as the day my 10-year-old self decided to marry him. But nothing - nothing compared - to Freddie that rainy day in a soggy Meath field. He arrived, excitingly, in a helicopter (20 years before they were routinely ferrying Celtic tiger cubs to race meetings), wearing a splendid crown. He threw off his cape and belted out hit after hit to a gagging crowd of badlypermed hair, double denim and leg warmers. Music critics (who know nothing) afterwards described a ""boring, lacklustre, uninspired"" set, but they were clearly at a different concert. Queen were quite simply the best thing I had ever seen. Freddie was brilliant, energetic, colourful, erratic and stunning. When he died, just five years later, I cried. Tears of sadness that he was no longer; tears of happiness that I got to see him."

The 2021 Global Report on Food Crises stated that 142 million people in 55 countries and territories are ""in crisis or worse"", an increase of around 20 million people from 2019. The pandemic has sadly shed light on the widening gap between rich and poor, and it has also undone some of the major advances that we've seen in recent years, including in relation to poverty eradication, public health advances, and equal access to education for girls. The pandemic, climate change and conflict are shared burdens that demand collective action by Government, by NGOs, and by local communities. Recent research by Dóchas's Worldview survey shows that 77 per cent of Irish people feel it is important that the Irish Government provides overseas development assistance (ODA). Importantly, they understand it is part of our Irishness, our values as a country, as we ourselves have journeyed through poverty, hunger, conflict, and now a major pandemic. One year ago, when the new Government was formed, we welcomed the programme for government's commitment in ""Our Shared Future"" to reach the internationally recognised target of spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas development assistance by 2030. In 2021, we will spend just 0.32 per cent of gross national income on overseas development assistance in support of the world's poorest.  To make this ambitious target towards 0.7 per cent a reality, the Government needs to act now. Increasing ODA in real terms will allow Ireland to make a difference in meeting global humanitarian needs now, as well as support the ongoing development needs in a post-Covid environment. The Government needs a clear targeted pathway to 0.7 per cent by 2030. Ireland is recognised globally for its principled and high-quality aid programme which lies at the heart of its ""Global Ireland"" strategy, and its international policy ""A Better World"". There are many places in the world where Irish aid has saved and transformed lives working alongside local communities. The decisions we take now as a collective, caring country will have far-reaching implications for the lives and livelihoods of so many. Now more than ever, Ireland needs to show leadership and stand together with the most vulnerable and poorest people on this fragile planet. - Yours, etc, SUZANNE KEATINGE,  CEO, Dóchas; AIDAN CLIFFORD,  Member of Board  of Directors,  A Partnership with Africa; SIOBHAN McGEE,  CEO, ActionAid Ireland; ALEX PIGOT, CEO,  Addressing  the Unaddressed; JOE MURRAY,  CEO, Afri; ANNE CLEARY,  CEO, Aidlink; SARAH O'TOOLE,  CEO, CBM Ireland; ROSAMOND BENNETT,  Chief Executive, Christian Aid Ireland; DOMINIC MacSORLEY, CEO, Concern Worldwide, and others.

Dr Denis McCauley, the chairman of IMO's GP committee, believes the crowds that descended on the capital from Inishowen and Carndonagh ""can't but have had an effect"" on rising cases in the northwest in the past two weeks, and suggested it may be ""one of a number of factors"". Recent figures showed Buncrana had a 14-day incidence rate of 608.1 per 100,000 while Carndonagh had the third-highest rate of infection at 489.3. ""Did it [the protest] have an impact? Of course it did. Did it have much of an impact? I have no idea. I can only imagine that it did,"" said the Ballybofey-based GP. ""It probably brought things forward by a week or so. It was only inevitable that it would happen anyway."" Infections have been highest in the 19 to 24 age group in the area, but Dr McCauley believes much of that is down to the ""cross-border effect"", given that Inishowen in the Republic and Derry in the North is ""one economic, social area"". ""It's a combination of what happens in Derry will happen in Buncrana. When there's a pull for young people to go into Derry to socialise, that's going to increase the spread of the virus,"" he said. ""It's a problem for all in Northern Ireland: it's gone up by a factor of nearly six in the last three weeks. The incidents have all doubled. When Covid restrictions differ on either side of the Border, there are always consequences."" Dr McCauley said the Delta variant is ""spreading among the young people and will become the dominant variant"" now that it makes up 70pc of the positive cases in the Republic. ""The only question will be: how will the numbers react? If the Delta variant was spreading to the same extent as it is in Northern Ireland, we could have 2,000 cases a day here,"" he said. ""There is an increase in north Donegal, there is an increase in Northern Ireland, there will be an increase throughout the rest of Ireland. ""But that will be dictated by the hospitality decisions and international travel decisions."" Dr McCauley said there will be ""morbidity and mortality"" associated with the increase, ""but we don't expect it to be too high and will be monitoring the situation across the Border"". ""Once we see the actual impact in Northern Ireland in the next week or 10 days, that will dictate the ultimate emotion that we have. Could it be relief ? Could it be concern? Or could it be grave worry? All of those emotions are potentially possible,"" he added. Dr Anthony Breslin, director of public health in the north-west, believes the ""artificial construct"" that is the Border ""has allowed Covid to spread"" and said healthcare officials such as him will be watching how the situation evolves in the coming weeks. ""It's about trying to identify why we are having these outbreaks. Obviously, it's late when you have an outbreak, but you try to stop it getting bigger. ""At the moment, all parts of the country, not just north-west Donegal, are watching residential and nursing homes like hawks. We don't want any outbreaks there."" Over the Border in Northern Ireland, the rate of infection in Derry and Strabane last week was the highest at the very moment the rate in Buncrana and Carndonagh was the highest in the Republic. Derry-based GP Dr Tom Black, the chairman of the British Medical Assocation in Northern Ireland, said he expects a surge in cases in the region over the next month. ""There has been a 60pc increase in infections in the past week - and three-quarters of those are the Delta variant, which is very transmissible,"" he said. ""We expect to see a continuing increase in infections over the next few weeks - probably peaking around the middle or end of August - and expect to see an increase in hospitalisations."" Around 80pc of people in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccination, with more than 60pc receiving two jabs. All elderly and clinically vulnerable people have been fully vaccinated. At one point last week there were 46 people in Northern Ireland's hospitals with Covid-19 and four in intensive care, compared with 800 in hospitals and 74 in intensive care in January. Two hospitals in Derry have halted visits after an increase in the number of patients with Covid-19 being admitted in the area. More than a third of the coronavirus-positive patients in Northern Ireland's hospitals are on wards in the Western Health and Social Care Trust. The trust confirmed last week that 27 elective procedures were cancelled because of a surge in admissions. ""The vaccine is holding up well against the Delta variant, but it's breaking through,"" says Dr Black. Northern Ireland's First and Deputy First Ministers Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill are to write to Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, calling for more cooperation between the two jurisdictions, a yearand-a-half since the pandemic began. In a joint statement following a meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill said they would contact the Irish Government to ""resolve any anomalies"" over international travel arrangements. ""We are aware that people here depart and arrive through airports based across the island, and for public safety and clear messaging it would be beneficial to all to have cooperation and consistency,"" they said. Speaking to the Sunday Independent, Ms O'Neill said the Executive is ""making steady, cautious progress"", but the Delta variant is ""now the dominant variant in the North and is spreading faster and cases are rising"". She said it will be mid-July ""before we understand the relationship between the positive cases, the hospitalisations and the deaths"". ""In terms of cross-border cooperation, it hasn't been good the whole way through. It has been really frustrating, to be honest. We had an advantage of fighting the pandemic as an island and that hasn't been the case from the beginning,"" she added. ""There's a good working relationship between the two chief medical officers [Dr Tony Holohan and Dr Michael McBride], but there's been no engagement at a political level and that has been really regrettable."" Cross-border cooperation hasn't been good the whole way through. It's really frustrating, to be honest Graphic   Dr Denis McCauley, chairman of the GP Committee of the Irish Medical Organisation.

The Cork TD's rule has come underfire following a dismal display in last week's Dublin Bay South by-election that saw the party's support slump to under five per cent. Several Deputies are now openly calling for a change in leadership before the next general election - despite Martin claiming he wants to stay on as the top dog. Outspoken Sligo-Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry called for Martin to step down over the weekend. And others demanded an in-person meeting to discuss the party's plummeting popularity in the polls. The Taoiseach went on the defensive yesterday and said he has been ""heartened"" by the positive messages of support he has received from members in recent days. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, Education Minister Norma Foley and Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath all went out to bat for the embattled leader over the weekend. Martin vowed to hold an in-person meeting of the parliamentary party to discuss the disappointing result and claimed he will work with dissenting voices to address their concerns. He said: ""In relation to an in-person meeting of the parliamentary party, I'm very open to that. It won't be this week for obvious reasons and I think we have to take stock of that but the party will discuss that. ""And I just have to say that I'm very heartened by the feedback I've received from the membership of the party who voted overwhelmingly for Fianna Fail to go into Government with a clear purpose to focus on the needs and concerns of the Irish people."" Speaking at the launch of the Pathways to Work Strategy, which aims to help 75,000 unemployed people back into a job, he added: ""We're coming through a very unprecedented pandemic. This strategy today illustrates again to the degree with which we're working in the midst of that pandemic to bring people back to work and to recover our economy. ""To take step changes in terms of policy around housing, health and climate change, that's what the people of Ireland want us as a Government and a party, my own party, to focus on and I'm very clear about that."" Pressed on the outcry from members within Fianna Fail, Martin said: ""I always work with my colleagues. I always engage with my colleagues - even those who obviously might have different perspectives than me and may criticise me.

Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien and Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe are locked in negotiations ahead of the publication the Government's 'Housing for All' plan. The Government must sign off on its Summer Economic Statement before the housing plan can be published. The economic statement will set out strict spending forecasts across all departments for the next five years. The forecasts have to be agreed by Government before the new housing plan and the National Development Plan can be announced. Mr Donohoe raised concerns at Cabinet over the need for the economic statement to be agreed urgently at a Cabinet meeting yesterday. Mr Donohoe is also believed to have raised the matter with his Fine Gael colleagues. At Cabinet, Taoiseach Micheál Martin insisted the housing plan had to be agreed before the economic statement could be published. One source said the Taoiseach said the housing plan had to be ""at the centre"" of the economic plan. Another source said there were ""terse exchanges"" between Mr Martin and Mr Donohoe over the housing plan. ""This is a very serious situation and Paschal said it will impact on the credibility of the Government if the economic plan is not published soon,"" the source added. There was surprise among some ministers that the Summer Economic Statement was not presented at yesterday's Cabinet meeting as had been expected. ""These statements are always delivered on time and it's quite significant that the date has been missed,"" a source said. There will now have to be another Cabinet meeting to sign off on the economic plan. There were meetings in Government Buildings involving senior officials on the economic statement and the housing plan. It comes just weeks after a split emerged in the Coalition over funding for the Land Development Agency (LDA), the key State body tasked with solving the housing crisis. Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien has been seeking to double the LDA's borrowing power to give it a budget of up to (EURO)3.75bn to build tens of thousands of homes in the coming years. But this proposal has faced opposition from Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe and officials in his Department. The LDA is being given an initial budget (EURO)1.25bn from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund against which it can borrow another (EURO)1.25bn. Mr O'Brien has asked for the agency to be allowed to borrow a further (EURO)1.25bn on top of this. But the Department of Finance rejected a proposal made by the Department of Housing last month over concerns about taxpayer exposure. Mr O'Brien, Mr Donohoe and Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath have been trying to resolve the matter in recent weeks. Mr Donohoe and Fine Gael are insisting that the LDA's budget, including its borrowing capacity, must be dealt with through the discussions on the Housing for All plan before it is published later this month. However, Mr O'Brien has been pushing to resolve this matter separately in a bid to get the new development body up and running. ""Right now the situation is that we have (EURO)2.5bn. We are looking at measures to increase that further and we are having discussions with colleagues on that,"" Mr O'Brien told the Sunday Independent last month. Graphic   Minister Darragh O'Brien"

The bad scoreline was only matched by the bad haircuts. Damian McKenzie and Richie Mo'unga should be up in The Hague for crimes against coiffure. Was Limahl the style consultant? Or Lionel Richie? That is the thing about the All Blacks - they have an almost sociopathic drive to pile on more points even when the last vestiges of competitive spirit is drained out of their opponents. The nil part tells you the lack of empathy with how they deal with even weak opposition. They would not ever consider a try on the house just for respectability's sake. How come Tonga are so bad? They have over 300 players in Europe alone playing professional rugby. Surely they could put a competitive side out against the All Blacks. Well, first there are the Covid and quarantine restrictions. Then there is the fact that French clubs incentivise their Pacific Islanders not to play international rugby. Hard cash will have a surprisingly retardant effect on your patriotic fervour. Then there is all that money that is pumped into the Pacific unions by world rugby that kinda gets spent on other things. It is bound to have consequences elsewhere. Last Wednesday, France played Australia in Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane in front of just 17,800 paying fans. Maybe there was a Covid quota or maybe a Wednesday night fixture did not suit everyone ... or maybe it was something else. For the first time in a long time, there were more players of Pacific Island descent playing in the Wallaby starting XV than there were players of European lineage. The count was eight to seven. You might say this is a result of the multi-cultural society that Australia's burgeoning immigrant population represents. The thing is that about 85pc of Australia's 25 million population is made up of Anglo Celts and Europeans. The documented Pacific Island demographic is under 1pc. When less than 1pc of the population supply more than half of the national team of any sport, that is a significant disproportion. Many of those players and their supporters consider home to be Tonga, Samoa and Fiji. When Mexico played the USA in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena about 10 years ago, nearly all the patrons at the game were citizens or residents of America, yet most were cheering for Mexico. The same thing happens in cricket when India and Pakistan tour the UK. This sort of a situation cannot but affect attendances and interest in the game in Australia. The South Sea Islanders are anatomically perfectly built to play rugby and because they mature physically extraordinarily quickly, they are in huge demand by the schools system in New Zealand and Australia, because of their physical prowess, and the scholarships follow. The Anglo Celts/Europeans don't develop as quick and get smashed up by Polynesian kids who are the same age but bigger and stronger. As a consequence, parents take their kids out of rugby and put them into soccer. Soccer is the fastest growing game in Australia and it is only a matter of time before it overtakes NRL and Aussie Rules as the number one sport. Australia had more press coverage and interest in the Denmark v England semi-final than anything else last week. That is saying something as the third State of Origin game is on Wednesday in Newcastle. Most of the Pacific Islanders in the Wallabies team are Tongan. How does it sit with them that their home nation could only scrabble together the equivalent of a pub side to play the All Blacks? The All Blacks themselves had an 8/7 mix of European to Polynesian players, the majority of whom were of Tongan origin, including superstar Mo'unga, who, on form, is the best player in the world. How do these players feel as they put over 100 points on their homeland? The Japanese team that played in the Aviva Stadium last week had four Tongan players in their squad, all of whom made a big impression at the World Cup and recently against the Lions and Ireland. In any market, it is about the ability to buy and sell. Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as a host of European countries, are willing and able to buy players and the South Sea Islanders are willing to sell because of economic necessity. These players are feted in their homeland or feted if they choose to stay in their new homeland. What difference does it make to them if the auld sod ships a few thumpings? Or you could take an entirely different view and look at the four or five players who are good enough to make it on to the All Blacks, Wallabies or Brave Blossoms sides. There are enough players there to make up a decent international XV but you are dreaming to think these players would trade what they have now for the pull of the heart strings for their national team. The damage, though, is not limited to what is done to a national side like Tonga, who have more talent than most established international sides but can't get their best qualified players to play for them. By playing for and dominating selections for sides like Australia, they do damage to the Wallabies too. In my opinion, it is a significant factor in the decline of support and player numbers in the game in Australia. The incorporation of new Super Rugby franchises - Fiji Drua and Moana Pasifika - for next season's competition will not change a thing. Australia and New Zealand will hang on to the players they want and anyone else who plays for these new franchises will play for a fraction of what British and Irish Lions prop Kyle Sinckler they can earn in Europe - that is if they can stand the poorly run club structure. It won't be a pathway for a Super Rugby supply line to a new improved national side. Speaking of Tongans, the Lions series may indeed rest on one player in a vital position. When Kyle Sinckler was not picked for the initial squad, he was quite upset, particularly when you consider that Zander Fagerson got in ahead of him. We are still two weeks away from the first Test in South Africa and we know that the battle of the front-rows could be vital. We know Tadhg Furlong will almost certainly start at tighthead. We know too that there is no chance that Fagerson will be sitting on the bench to replace him when the Wexford man has done his 60 minutes. If Sinckler is on the bench - and I am certain he will be - why was he not picked in the first place? The tighthead side of the scrum is strong but given Mako Vunipola's recent injury profile and less than impressive form, there are now serious concerns about the Lions stock of looseheads. Rory Sutherland is very handy around the park but if the Saffers get a sniff that he is a little bit off where he needs to be at scrumtime, this could be a very long tour for both props. Alun Wyn Jones at third choice may end up as a starter by default on the basis that he might just be able to scrum. Vunipola's performance at scrum-time against a limited Sharks side on Wednesday left you wondering is there an unexpected Achilles heel here. Do Tonga have any more decent props they could send us?

The emeritus professor of economics and fellow of Merton College at the University of Oxford and former professor of political economy at University College Dublin was a world authority on trade economics. He was widely regarded as the most talented and committed Irish academic economist of his generation.  Philip Lane, former governor of the Central Bank and current chief economist of the European Central Bank, said that Neary inspired him on how to carry out high-level, globally-relevant research in Irish universities and how to develop the wider economics profession. Neary had an astonishingly productive research record and was editor or associate editor of many prestigious international economic journals. It was often said that he published more papers in top economic journals than all other Irish economists put together. He was a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London since the 1980s, an international research fellow of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany and a fellow of CESifo Research Network in Munich, Germany. He was also the only Irish president of the European Economic Association and one of only two Irish presidents of the Royal Economic Society.  Throughout his illustrious career, he was a visiting scholar or professor at universities throughout Europe and North America including Princeton and Berkeley in the US; Kingston, Ontario, in Canada; and the École Polytechnique in Paris.  His entry in the international edition of Who's Who in 2002 and his Royal Irish Academy Gold Medal in social sciences in 2006 are a sample of the many honours he was awarded.  Dundalk and Drogheda  Born the eldest of four children to Dr Peter and Anne Neary, James Peter Neary grew up first in Dundalk and then in Drogheda, Co Louth, where his father worked as a doctor. He was a quiet child and a voracious reader who showed no interest in sport. At Clongowes Wood College in Co Kildare, his contemporaries remember that the maths teachers were terrified of him as he knew more than they did. Following his secondary school education, Neary studied at UCD, graduating with a first-class honours in both his Bachelor of Arts in economics, politics and statistics in 1970 and his master's degree in economics in 1971. His study notes were so meticulous that college friends still remember how valuable they were to borrow before exams. He gained employment as a research assistant at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin straight from college and became the first in his generation to publish in a peer-reviewed journal. He applied his skills in econometrics to the development of a software package that was widely used in academia, research institutes and banks.  From 1972-1974, he was a junior lecturer at Trinity College Dublin. Following this, he went to Nuffield College at the University of Oxford to study for his PhD which was a systematic study of the international movement of capital in different sectors in the short and long term. But it was his appointment as a full professor of political economy at UCD in 1980 at the age of 29 that was to be most influential. Former governor of the Central Bank Patrick Honohan, who had studied at UCD with him, said that Neary's appointment as a professor at UCD was a key moment in the modernisation of economics teaching in Ireland. He joined the new generation of economists, including Paddy Geary, Colm McCarthy and Brendan Walsh, and stayed for 26 years.  ""Peter pushed for the gold standard of teaching being underpinned by research carried out to the highest international standards and published in top journals,"" said Honohan in a tribute on irisheconomy.ie. The school of economics at UCD held a celebration of Neary's contribution to economics in April 2021. At that online event, collaborators and friends from his student and lecturing days remembered his sharp intellect, infectious enthusiasm for economic research, insatiable curiosity, warmth, wit and charm. Cormac Ó Gráda, emeritus professor of economics at UCD, said that when Irish economists travelled to conferences in the last 40 years, the first question they were asked was if they knew Peter Neary. ""Peter Neary is the Seamus Heaney of economics. He is our Roy Keane, our Bono,"" he said.  Aside from his passion for economics, Neary enjoyed cooking, hiking and travelling with family and friends. In 1990 his 18-year marriage to Irish economist Frances Ruane - with whom he had two children, Philip and David - ended. He went on to spend the next 30 years with Mairéad Hanrahan, now professor of French at University College London. The couple have two adult children, Róisín and Eoin. Although primarily a theorist, Neary became involved in economic policy decisions. For example, he publicly questioned the decision of the Irish government to adopt the euro, pointing out both the importance of Ireland's trade with the UK and how a euro area monetary policy might be inappropriate for a single, small member state. More recently, he built a strong economic case against a hard Brexit. At conferences, Neary made complex material accessible. His most cited paper, which he wrote with Max Corden in the 1982 Economic Journal, analysed how a sectoral boom could divert labour from elsewhere in the economy and result in deindustrialisation, as happened in the Netherlands after the discovery of North Sea oil and oil price rises of the 1970s. This paper changed economic policymakers' understanding of how best to manage a resource boom.  Peter Neary is survived by his wife, Mairéad Hanrahan, his children, Philip and David Neary and Róisín and Eoin Hanrahan, and his granddaughter, Clara, his brothers, John and Paul, his sister, Sheila (Talini), and his mother, Anne."

Family resource centres say they are being inundated with calls from worried parents unable to return to work or education at the moment, while others who are desperate to get off the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) cannot do so. There is a lack of community-based providers of childcare, and some creches have indicated they will no longer accept children under the age of two years, the Dáil was told recently. In Co Cavan, TD Pauline Tully said some providers had stopped catering for babies ""due to the financial strain in meeting regulations"". Ms Tully, who is Sinn Féin's spokesperson on disability and carers, told the Irish Independent: ""There is a shocking shortage of community-based childcare. Parents want to go back to work but they can't afford private fees. ""I've had parents tell me that they are taking 16 weeks' unpaid leave as there's no childcare available. A number of creches across Cavan said they're not taking children under one, now they're saying they're not taking children under two."" Tusla, the child and family agency, said there were now 130 fewer childcare providers than there had been in 2019. As of May 2021, 4,183 early-years services were registered with Tusla, with 1,370 of those (31.76pc) catering for children under two. In 2019, 4,313 services were registered, with just over a third (33.8pc) of these taking children under two. ""The decision to cater for certain age cohorts is a matter for the individual early years providers, taking into account the circumstances and context of their specific services,"" a Tusla spokesperson said. Baby rooms require a staffto-child ratio of 1:3 and these children are too young to be included in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme. The State pays participating services a set sum per child to offer the ECCE service, which applies to children who are aged from two years and eight months. It continues until they transfer to primary school, provided they are not older than five years and six months at the end of the preschool year. Tara Lynagh, manager of Teach Oscail Resource Centre in Cavan town, said parents in the area could not get off the PUP because they were struggling to find childcare. ""We've a lot of calls coming in from parents who are saying there aren't enough creche spaces for them to return to work. There's no community childcare spaces in Cavan town,"" she said. ""Any parent that is trying to take themselves off PUP can't do it as they've nobody to mind their children and it's causing major problems. We're inundated with phone calls on the issue. One creche which caters for 15 kids has a waiting list of 50 children."" According to Pobal's 2020 early-years sector survey, there are just over 1,200 community childcare providers in Ireland, compared to nearly 3,500 private services. The ratio of community to private service providers varies significantly between counties. Those with the highest proportions of community services are Monaghan (58pc), Leitrim (54pc) and Donegal (47pc). The counties with the lowest include Kildare (6pc), Meath (11pc) and the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area (12pc). Around 60pc of childcare providers in Cavan are privately owned. The Pobal report shows only 3pc of community services were in affluent or very affluent areas, compared to 11pc of private services. Ms Lynagh said she had staff working part-time who were paying up to (EURO)200 a week for childcare. ""They're essentially just using their wages to get their children minded.""

Essentially the sheep were split into three groups since lambing. We had the 'experimental' ewes: 120 ewes rearing on average 1.92 lambs each. There was a flock of 22 triplet-rearing ewes and 66 lambs; many of these ewes were part of the above experiment. Finally, there were the 'remaining' ewes: mature ewes not in the above two groups, a small number of ewe lambs and the repeat lambing ewes, excluding a small number of triplets. Overall, we were happy with how the lambs performed from lambing to weaning. For the triplet ewes, each ewe weaned on average 99kg of lamb. This is equivalent to 1.32 kg lamb liveweight weaned per kg of ewe liveweight mated. The management of the triplet ewes starts on the day of scanning in late December. Once a ewe is identified as carrying triplets, she is preferentially treated, grazing reseeded grass swards, prior to moving to Redstart on February 1. Concentrate feeding began on Redstart at a rate of 0.5kg per day (with suitable build-up), increasing to 1kg at housing around three weeks before lambing. After lambing, ewes remained indoors for seven days and were offered ad lib grass silage plus 1.5kg of concentrates per day. Ewes and lambs were then turned out to grass where ewes received 1kg of concentrate per day for a further three weeks, followed by 0.75kg per day for two weeks with one week of receiving 0.5kg of concentrates per day, prior to concentrates being removed at seven weeks post-lambing. Lambs had access to creep feed from two weeks until 10 weeks, when creep was removed due to pilfering by crows. This did not appear to affect performance, given the weaning weights achieved. From now until slaughter the lambs will graze Redstart; in the past, this has supported lamb growth rates of 210g per day from weaning to slaughter for our triplet lambs. The experimental ewes, which form part of Jonathan Higgins's PhD studies, were fed either perennial ryegrass or a multi-species sward. Lambs weaned on the multi-species sward were 4kg heavier at weaning than their perennial ryegrass counterparts, while the ewes on the multi-species sward were 6kg heavier at weaning. This confirms previous findings with these swards. The remaining cohort of lambs were weaned at 36kg live weight, well ahead of our target of 33kg for this flock. This reflects a growing season where the swards remained in the 'Goldilocks zone' of being just right all along, but never very comfortable in terms of supply of grass or rainfall. The next month will focus on maintaining quality swards in front of the lambs, selecting lambs as they become fit for slaughter, identification of ewes for culling, and planning for sourcing replacement stock.

Their dismissive treatment of Down in the preliminary round - winning by 16 points - was neatly packaged as a response to last winter's shock Ulster final loss to Cavan but the pain can't have been too piercing if it takes just one shot to numb it. The reality is the pain is still there but it has been displaced with concern generated by just how close they came to having their summer torched by Derry in www.Ballybofey.No matter how well Derry played - and it is hard not to see this as the moment that Rory Gallagher's team announced themselves as future Anglo Celt Cup contenders - nothing can disguise the fact that Donegal simply did not play at a level which their status as All-Ireland hopefuls demanded. However, that may not be all bad. The narrative of Donegal's form in Declan Bonner's previous three Championships is that by winning big, early and often, they put their hands up as Dublin's most likely challengers only to plunge off a cliff without a qualifier safety net to catch them. This time, as they eyeball Tyrone in Sunday's Ulster semi-final, they have at least been forewarned but, given the nature of the opposition, that should not be needed. Had performance dictated the outcome last Sunday, it would be Derry heading to Brewster Park to play the Red Hands, but in winning against the head Bonner has both a stick to beat his players and a form guide to inform his team selection. Of all the criticism directed at Donegal, the most pointed came from the BBC studio at half-time when county legend Martin McHugh did not spare the players or Bonner. 'There are certain players who are not up to it, not good enough and I think that we need to get players on the field of intercounty standard that are good enough, and I think that Donegal have to make that call,' said McHugh. As it transpired, Bonner did just that. In reaching into his bench, he saved the game, most notably through the contributions of Michael Murphy, Odhrán MacNiallais and Paul Brennan. But while that might indicate a wealth of options, there is an element of false depth to that. Murphy and MacNiallais were only on the bench because they were rehabbing from injuries, while Brennan was one of the fallguys for a defence that was exposed badly during the League, not least with the concession of four goals against Monaghan. MacNiallais will likely start with Ciaran Thompson perhaps the most vulnerable, and it will be intriguing to see Bonner's willingness to gamble with Murphy. The Donegal captain's impact when introduced in the 45th minute was huge, extending far beyond the two frees he converted and his assist for Brennan's monster point that did much to alter the mood music of the game. 'Michael coming on was a big help to us,' admitted fellow veteran Neil McGee afterwards. 'That was huge when he came on because we were four points down. 'He gave us a focal point up there and stretched them a little bit,' added the full-back. Far more importantly, Murphy's on-field presence calmed a team whose decisionmaking looked rushed and erratic, resulting in unnecessary turnovers which provided Derry with oxygen. Bonner now has a decision to make, one that will almost certainly be informed by his medical team given that Murphy is on his second comeback this season from a recurring hamstring injury. The 29 minutes of game-time he was exposed to on Sunday was more than they would have wanted to give their 31-year-old captain, and it is a long way to go from that to a full 70-minute-plus test inside seven days. It is not so much the amount of time that Murphy gets to play, but when he gets to play that will matter most. Previous meetings between Donegal and Tyrone tell us that this will be something of a tight squeeze for both teams. In that likely event, Bonner will need his on-field manager on the pitch at the business end. One of the drawbacks of Donegal's blistering early form in Ulster over the past three seasons is that they simply have not been exposed often enough to the type of contests where nerves are stretched further than lungs. In fact, Sunday's win was over Derry was only the second time in 11 Ulster Championship games under Bonner that the tie has come down to a one-score game. And the previous time was last winter when Donegal edged out Tyrone on a 1-13 to 1-11 score line in Ballybofey in a contest where Murphy's game management in the final quarter was close to perfection. The lesson in that for Donegal and Bonner is to feel the fear but ensure it never becomes a debilitating factor. And the only way to make sure of that is to have the man who knows no fear on the pitch when it matters most.

Exhausted Pete Currier swapped working gigs with Prince, UB40 and Nirvana to sail the 6,500km from the Carribean to Wales - but found himself in dire straits when his engine blew just three weeks into the voyage. The 68-year-old was forced to continue the trip from the island of Carriacou, in Grenada, by sail - and called on his decades of hard work in rock 'n' roll to get him through a horror 68kph storm. Relieved Pete was then picked up off Kinsale, Co Cork, by the RNLI on Saturday evening where his son, Piers Currier, and two daughters, Cara and Shia Tremayne, were waiting for him. He told the Irish Sun: ""There was just one time when I feared for my life during a force eight storm as I feared the boat might disintegrate in the storm. ""But the Sea Symphony struggled on through it and I survived. But I never worried about anything in my life so the dangers did not cause me major upset."" His 51-foot vessel was in Irish waters on Saturday morning, labouring under damaged sails. And by the time the alarm was raised with the Irish Coast Guard, the boat was travelling at three knots - or 5.5km - per hour. Kinsale RNLI volunteers tracked the Sea Symphony throughout the day online and grew increasingly concerned for its safety. Its inshore lifeboat, Miss Sally Anne Baggy II - Never Fear, Baggy's Here, launched at 6pm to help Pete and they located the yacht off the Old Head of Kinsale. Lifeboat helm Jonathan Connor placed crew member Felix Milner onboard Pete's boat and guided it the nearest safe port. And Felix remained on the Sea Symphony for the final leg of the journey to Kinsale Harbour to look after the music veteran, who was exhausted but uninjured. After arriving into Kinsale at 9.15pm, Pete was able to scrub himself clean with his first hot shower in seven weeks before a family reunion with his three kids, who live in West Cork. Grateful Pete said: ""Volunteers at Kinsale RNLI are some of the nicest people I have ever met. Their expertise and commitment leave me humbled. ""It is an institution I have always supported and will do so for the rest of my days."" And he said of his rescuers: ""They took me to the lifeboat station for a hot shower, told me repeatedly what a lovely boat and even offered to take my laundry home and wash it for me."" Pete, a live events production manager, worked with U2 on their world tour until he was involved in an accident when sound equipment toppled over and injured him. It left him unable to work and he was on crutches for about nine months having damaged his back. So Pete moved back to the UK to spend time with his mum, who sadly passed away in May 2019. He used ""the bit of money"" he inherited to buy the Sea Symphony in January 2020, which he hoped could be his new home and provide him with a new start in life. He said: ""She is a beautiful boat and deserves to be sailing again so I bought her and have spent all my time rebuilding and repairing her."" During the pandemic, Pete spent a year with one of his daughters in Cork and was delighted that he was able to spend time with his other kids. He said: ""I couldn't get back to Grenada because just two days before I was due to fly back the country shut down. ""My daughter said 'come spend some time with me' - and I was delighted as I hadn't spent time with her since she was a teenager."" The family moved to Ireland in 1991, because his wife, from whom he is divorced, wanted to bring up the children in her mum's homeland. Pete said: ""All the kids were born in the UK but their mum wanted to move to Ireland and I was touring almost non-stop so it made sense."" As soon as flights to Grenada opened up, he went back to the sunny island and his boat, which can sleep eight. Pete said people have said he was mad to put so much time and effort into the yacht. But the Birmingham native added: ""You take your chances in life and this is worth the chance."" He has spent over a year trying to save the Sea Symphony, which had been left to rot after being brought to Grenada in 2017. An invasion of termites ate one of the masts and a lot of the interior. But after getting it back up to scratch, Pete planned to bring it over to Britain. He explained: ""With all the changes Covid-19 has brought, it's a whole new world. I was hoping to sail south and across the South Atlantic to the UK as most of my possessions are still there."" Following a short stop off in Kinsale he planned to go to Wales, the South of France and then onto India where he had a work gig organised. However, the Indian event has been postponed indefinitely again because of Covid. He is now faced with repairing five of the six sails on board as well as repairs to the engine and winches before he can sail from the Cork town to the UK. Speaking after the rescue, Kinsale RNLI helm Jonathan Connor said: ""It is a tribute to the sailor's seamanship that he made a 6,500km voyage single-handed and remained calm and focused despite the many problems he encountered in the course of his journey. ""He is very fit and able but was clearly exhausted after 52 days alone at sea. ""We were glad to help him over the final hurdle and bring him safely to Kinsale."" Meanwhile, Pete has told of his time with U2, revealing that his favourite member of the band was The Edge who was a gentleman ""and a nice guy"". He added: ""I worked most of my life with bands, designed and operated lighting for loads of bands and festivals including Glastonbury main stage, Pop Rock Festival and lots of others. I did loads of festivals over the years and toured with famous bands."" When he left U2 he worked on a tour with Michael Jackson. But nowadays Pete picks and chooses what he wants to do. Speaking about the good old days working with bands and at gigs, he said: ""When I was young it was a good laugh. ""It started paling in the Eighties and by the Nineties it became a business. You were basically friends with people through the Sixties up to the Nineties, when it was like being in a family. ""By the Nineties you were just a face and people didn't want to know each other anymore. It was quite pathetic."" He added: ""I do quite a lot of holograms nowadays. ""I love technology, absolutely love it. Technology is finally catching up with my imagination. ""I am always trying to push the boundaries with stuff, which is so exciting."" l PETE has set up a Gofundme page to help get the Sea Symphony back to her former glory and ""once again sailing the oceans of the world"". He tells prospective donors: ""To my mind she is a work of art and I am privileged to work on renovating her."" After his dramatic rescue he plans to donate ten per cent of donations to the RNLI.

Naturgy, then known as Gas Natural Fenosa, bought Dublin-based Vayu Energy in 2016 from Swiss commodities group Glencore and the company's then managing director Colm Kennedy for an undisclosed sum at the time.  The Spanish group's annual report for the year subsequently disclosed that the deal was worth EUR 32 million.  Vayu was renamed as Naturgy Ireland in 2018 as part of a rebranding of the wider group.  Naturgy has hired Deloitte in Spain to manage the sale, coming at a time when European wholesale gas prices have spiked to record highs this summer, with a knock-on effect on electricity prices.  Increases  Gas price inflation has been fuelled by a variety of factors, including a rundown in storage stocks after a cold winter, rebounding economic activity from the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, and supply outages.  Energy suppliers are beginning to pass on increases to customers.  Data published by the International Energy Agency last week showed European gas consumption rose by an estimated 25 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, its largest year- on-year quarterly increase since at least 1985. Initial teaser documents circulated by Deloitte recently to potential interested parties - which did not name the seller or the business being marketed - highlighting that the business has 250 industrial and co- mmercial clients and delivered a EUR 11.7 million gross profit on EUR 112.7 million of revenues last year.  Sources have confirmed to The Irish Times that the sale relates to Naturgy's Irish energy supply business. Representatives for Naturgy Energy Group, the Irish unit and Deloitte in Spain declined to comment.  Vayu, which was founded in 2003, reported gross profit of EUR 6.7 million on EUR 108.7 million of revenue in 2015, before it was acquired by its current owner.  Profitable  It is not clear whether the sale will also include Dublin-based Naturgy Limited's sometimes highly profitable liquefied natural gas trading subsidiaries in Ireland and Singapore, which paid EUR 160.1 million of dividends in 2019, according to filings with the Companies Registration Office. This served to push Naturgy Limited's net profit to almost EUR 168 million for the year, up from EUR 9.49 million in 2018.  Naturgy Ireland's roll call of customers includes Eir, Bulmers, DAA, Irish Rail and Virgin Media.  The company supplies natural gas to almost 20 per cent of the industrial and commercial market in Ireland, according to its website. It is also a supplier of 100 per cent renewable electricity.  The Madrid-listed Naturgy Energy Group has a market value of EUR 21.4 billion and operates in more than 30 countries around the world, serving more than 23 million customers."

There has been controversy over the huge project for years amid spiralling costs and delays which means that the hospital will not now open for patients until 2024. The last official figure for the cost of the project was EUR 1.433 billion. There is concern the final cost will be much higher when delays -some caused by the Covid-19 pandemic - and other issues like inflation in the cost of construction materials and Brexit affecting the supply of goods and services, are factored in. Officials from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) and Department of Health declined to provide the Dáil's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) with current estimates of the final cost. NPHDB chief executive David Gunning said claims by the contractor BAM have the potential to contribute to the overall cost of the project but elaborating on the estimated total cost could compromise the board's ability to negotiate on behalf of the State. Fiona Prendergast, director of health infrastructure at the Department of Health, said there is an analysis on the best way forward for the NCH project but it is ""commercially sensitive and must remain confidential for an extended period"". She said it would be ""inappropriate"" and ""likely detrimental"" to the project to speculate on the costs.  'Huge frustration' Fianna Fáil TD Paul McAuliffe said there is ""huge frustration"" surrounding the project and he asked for the total value of the claims made by the contractor.  The assessment of the claims involves a review by an employer representative who at this point has been notified of 906 claims totalling EUR 446 million. Mr McAuliffe suggested that the cost of the NCH could be in the region of EUR 1.9 billion as a result of the claims, while accepting that ""they may not go that way""."

Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien defended the move, claiming 2,400 social houses would be 'at risk' otherwise. He cited unpublished research from officials within his department as justification for the measure. In May, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe introduced a 10% stamp duty levy on the purchase of more than ten homes. Last night's amendment exempts funds from paying the 10% stamp duty if they lease the homes back to local authorities to be used for social housing. Speaking to reporters yesterday, Minister O'Brien said that the amendment was necessary to ensure there was adequate social housing stock for homeless families. 'If anyone is telling me now that we shouldn't make an exception so those families are not housed in the short term, I'd like them to put the argument to me. It is a small exemption that will be timebound,' he said. In May of this year, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said that such leases, which last for 25 years and result in the State not owning the home, amounted to a 'bad deal'. Speaking on RTÉ's Drivetime yesterday, Mr O'Brien conceded that the Government could 'potentially' borrow to buy the homes, but that it would require a greater capital investment. He described the measures as 'short term' and transitionary, although there is no sunset clause for the exemption to lapse. The minister said he was working on ways to amend lease arrangements to allow local authorities to acquire homes when the lease lapses. Mr O'Brien said he did not see how anyone in Opposition could justify not allowing the planned leases to go ahead. 'If... they want us to scrap those leases that are in the pipeline, that are going to house between 2,500 and 3,000 people over the next 12 months, I don't think that is something that I could actually stand over. Maybe they can,' he said. 'I think there's been a little bit of scaremongering over this, quite frankly.' The minister said the Government has introduced 'significant changes' to protect home-seekers from bulk- buying of houses by large institutions, and that exemptions for cuckoo funds will be time limited. But speaking in the Dáil last night during a short hour-long debate on the issue, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said that the plan put forward by the Government to tackle vulture funds was a 'con job' and that you 'couldn't make it up'. Mr Doherty claimed that the Government had ignored all advice, including on excluding apartments from the 10% stamp duty rate. He said the amendment would allow 'investment funds to dodge the stamp duty surcharge when they snap up homes under the noses of struggling home buyers and then lease them back to local authorities'. He added that local authorities and taxpayers would be 'picking up the bill and paying rents to these investment funds that are not then even subject to corporation tax thanks to tax arrangements gifted to them by this Government'. Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shorthall told the Dáil: 'The Government has taken shamelessness to a whole new level in proceeding with this brazen amendment.

And it was also revealed that half of parents living with an adult child would like them to move out. Research by the Central Statistics Office found that almost five in ten people who live alone in rented accommodation said they are often under financial pressure. Separately, the survey also highlighted the positive influence pets have on lone householders.

Some 25 units at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan will be rented for at least 25% below the open market price. The cost rental scheme will see residents pay rents that are solely based on the cost to build, manage and maintain the homes. A two-bed house in the development will be rented for (EURO)935 a month. The three-bed houses will be rented for (EURO)1,100 a month, while tenants in the four-bedroom homes will pay rent of (EURO)1,150 a month. In order to qualify for the cost rental scheme, prospective tenants must have a net household income below (EURO)53,000 and prove that they can pay the rent. Also, they cannot own a property and cannot be in receipt of any social housing supports. Minister O'Brien stated yesterday that some 440 cost rental homes will be provided this year.

Finance ministers from the group of 20 (G20) nations meet in Venice today, the week after 130 countries endorsed new taxing rights for countries where multinationals operate, and a 15pc tax on their global profits. While the G20 is a major milestone on the way to a deal - following previous G7 endorsement - there are many variables still in play. ""The G20 is not the end of the road, it's rather the beginning of the process that must then be translated into legislation at European level,"" Spain's and economy minister Nadia Calvino told the Institute for International and European Affairs yesterday. The European Commission has said it will translate any global deal into EU law by 2023, but it is also planning a separate digital tax that threatens to rile the US and cause a trade war. BusinessEurope, which represents European companies, warned the Commission to ""think carefully about the consequences"" of bringing forward a digital tax just as a global deal is within reach. ""We are particularly concerned that such a levy could damage relations with our major trading partner the US - where concerns have already been raised about the EU's digital levy - with the potential for ongoing tariff retaliation, and endanger future prospects for the swift agreement and implementation of a global deal in both the US and other countries,"" BusinessEurope chiefs Pierre Gattaz and Markus Beyrer wrote to Commission president Ursula von der Leyen this week. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is reportedly pushing for a minimum tax rate well above 15pc. A US domestic tax overhaul, which is currently being debated in Congress, sets a 21pc rate on multinationals' global profits, which could make the US less attractive to investors if it's not mirrored at global level. It will be down to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which brokered the deal, to work out the finer details. The Irish Government has said it ""fully"" supports the first pillar of the OECD deal on reallocating taxing rights, but has reservations about the 15pc rate. While the Government has priced in a (EURO)2bn a year loss from the reallocation rules, it's unclear how much a 15pc top-up tax could drain from the public finances - especially if multinationals decide it's no longer worthwhile investing in Ireland. ""The minimum rate agreed of at least 15pc will be a departure both materially and for our global brand,"" said Gerard Brady, chief economist for business group Ibec. ""We will need to meet this competitiveness challenge by investing in other growth levers such as education, research and development and critical infrastructure. If we are proactive on this front there is no reason that Ireland can't continue to be an attractive location for investment.""

The pandemic has seen youth unemployment spiral, and a new strategy will set a target of reducing the current 44 per cent rate to 12.5 per cent by 2023.  The Irish Times also understands that the Coalition will today give its strongest signal yet that it will seek to bring in a system of jobseekers' payments that is linked to a person's earnings prior to the loss of their job.  Taoiseach Micheál Martin will be joined by Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys and other Ministers for the launch of the Pathways to Work Strategy 2021-2025. Along with the commitment on reducing youth unemployment the strategy also commits to getting 75,000 long-term unemployed people back to work by the summer of 2023.  The plan includes a EUR 1,000 grant for people on unemployment payments to enter training in short-term accredited courses at a total cost of EUR 11 million per year.  Examples could include construction workers taking classes on driving heavy-goods vehicles or people who sign up for beauty therapy courses with the aim of strengthening CVs. On the employer side there is to be an extension of the age threshold for recruitment subsidies for those who hire younger workers. Currently the cut-off age is 25, but this is to be increased to 30 in a bid to encourage the hiring of an extra 8,000 workers. The subsides range between EUR 7,500 and EUR 10,000 over a two-year period. There is also expected to be an announcement that Department of Social Protection officials have been asked to draft proposals for how a new ""pay-related jobseekers' payment"" could be brought in. Hospitality  When the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP) was introduced the top rate of EUR 350 per week figure was decided upon as it was similar to the pay levels of many people losing their jobs in Covid-hit sectors like hospitality.  The Government has announced plans for phased reductions in the PUP to match the rate of jobseekers' payments as the pandemic recedes. The first cut happens in September, with those on the EUR 350 per week rate seeing that drop to EUR 300 a week, and those on the EUR 300 rate seeing it reduce to EUR 250 a week.  Department officials are to explore how unemployment payments linked to a person's previous earnings could be introduced so that people that lose their jobs would not immediately end up with a cliff-edge reduction of income to the current jobseekers' rate of EUR 203 per week. Sources said there is currently no target date for when this would happen, with considerations like cost to the State to be taken into account. "

The Strategic Housing Development (SHD) legislation, which removed the right to appeal planning decisions on large scale housing, coupled with ministerial directives on height and build-to-rent schemes which overrode county development plans, had undermined trust in the planning system, according to the new group Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance.  These ""undemocratic and unsustainable"" changes to the planning system were introduced ""at the behest of the property industry"" but had failed to provide homes, said former Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland president Robin Mandal, who is heading up the new group. The Government decision to terminate the SHD system, where developers of large residential schemes bypass the local authority planning stage and apply directly to An Bord Pleanála, was welcome, said Mr Mandal, but the high volume of legal challenges to planning decisions was set to continue while ministerial directives were allowed to overrule county and city development plans. The ministerial guidelines, which facilitate apartment schemes that contravene development plans in terms of height and space standards, had been a ""misguided attempt to ease the housing crisis"", Mr Mandal said. ""There is no correlation between the construction of excessively tall buildings and providing people with a place to live. It's like saying the way to deal with a famine is to bring in a couple of obese people because then the statistics will show everyone is the correct weight.""  Trophy skyscrapers  Mr Mandal, who has retired from commercial practice, said these trophy skyscrapers were either not being constructed because of their excessive cost or where they were built the apartments were unaffordable. On the other hand, build-to-rent apartments did represent a good deal for investment funds but were ""dire"" places to live, he said. ""The big rash of applications for build-to-rent schemes has had nothing to do with housing needs, but were because you can get away with having much lower standards,"" he said.  ""You can have 100 per cent site coverage, you don't have to provide balconies or car parking, and you can pay off the requirement to provide public open space by a financial contribution to the local authority. You can have as many studio apartments as you want - what we would have previously called bedsits. They are the real rock bottom in terms of space."" The group, which includes representatives of more than 50 residents' associations, was ""pro-development"" and ""pro-density"" he said, but this was best achieved through the traditional planning process, where applications were made to a local authority and could be appealed to An Bord Pleanála if necessary. ""We do have to increase density, nobody is questioning that, but we can do that through proper planning, not through letting developers run rip."" The changes to planning rules had been introduced ""on the false premise"" that the planning process was slowing down the delivery of housing, but this had never been the case, said Mr Mandal. ""The legislation has, in fact, slowed down the delivery of housing as developers use the process to increase land values rather than construct homes.""  Shovel-ready sites  Removing limits on height and reducing apartment standards through the build-to-rent provisions had resulted in developers resubmitting applications for schemes that already had permission. ""Shovel-ready sites, with planning permission, are not being built upon as the owners seek more numbers of units. Of the approximately 70,000 units that have been permitted, only some 7,000 are under construction""  He said another 7,000 homes were the subject of judicial review proceedings which had ""skyrocketed in number"" since the enactment of the SHD and ministerial guidelines legislation, ""and are a symptom of a planning system that increasingly excludes the citizen's voice"". ""The property industry is saying we have to stop people taking judicial reviews without saying why they are taking judicial reviews. If we get back to normal planning where development plans are not overruled, and the right to appeal is restored, we will see a drop back to very tiny numbers going to the courts."""

Restaurants and bars have waited for months to reopen indoors - long after the rest of the EU. Hard-hit Irish businesses have not only endured enforced closures amid the pandemic, but false dawns with reopening dates kicked down the road. Stock and resources have been needlessly wasted because of Government indecision - not to mention the stress faced by owners and staff. Now the Government has heralded a plan to reopen indoor dining, with Taoiseach Micheal Martin and Tanaiste Leo Varadkar talking up the Coalition's decision to restart indoor hospitality. But despite their positive pronouncements, many questions remain. That in itself is deeply worrying considering how long the Government have had to come up with a pathway. The new laws will require people to prove they're fully vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 in the last nine months before they can eat or drink inside a pub or restaurant. People will be able to use the EU digital vaccine cert, which is being emailed and posted out to vaccinated people this week, to avail of indoor hospitality. But opposition politicians have branded the plans ""unenforceable, unworkable and discriminatory"". The simple truth is that there are still so many holes and a lack of clarity. Everyone wants restaurants and bars back in business. But after delaying the reopening for so long, it's up to Government to get it right."

Under the (EURO)75m scheme the State will provide up to 20pc of the purchase price of the property. The move to remove any obligation to repay the 20pc shared equity loan is to allay Central Bank concerns, Davy Stockbrokers said. The State will charge no interest on the shared equity scheme amount it provides for five years, and then a rate of just 1.75pc will apply for the next 15 years. It means people will effectively get an interest-only mortgage for up to 20pc of the value of the home, that is not repayable unless they sell the home. Those who qualify for the scheme could just pay the interest on the State equity amount but not the principal, if they remain in the home. The stake being put up by the State under the shared equity scheme is in addition to funding from the help-tobuy scheme. This means the State could provide up to 30pc of the purchase price of newly built homes. Homebuyers would use their own deposit and a traditional mortgage from a bank for the rest. The combination of the two support schemes could see the State funding up to (EURO)100,000 of a home bought for (EURO)350,000. The high level of funding has raised fears that the State supports will over-stimulate the market and push prices even higher at a time when there is a chronic shortage of homes to buy. Davy Stockbrokers economist Conall Mac Coille said the new scheme was likely to further stimulate the housing market. Last week, the Affordable Housing Bill, which gives legislative backing to the shared equity scheme, passed through the Dáil. Mr Mac Coille said the Central Bank had yet to approve the scheme. He said the change that means those availing of the shared equity scheme do not have to repay the principal if they remain in the house was made to gain approval for the scheme from the Central Bank. He expects it will be operational by September. Under the shared equity scheme the 20pc equity loan will be available to first-time buyers of newly built homes. The scheme will only apply for houses valued at up to (EURO)400,000 in Dublin, and apartments priced up to (EURO)450,000 in Dublin. The price cap is (EURO)350,000 in Meath and Kildare. Mr Mac Coille wrote in an investment note: ""Crucially, there is no obligation to repay the equity loan as long as the property remains the primary residence."" He said the loan equity can be used with the 10pc helpto-buy cash rebate, ""so the State will provide 30pc of the purchase price"". The interest rate on the shared equity funding will be 0pc for the first five years, 1.75pc to year 15, and 2.15pc to year 30. Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien's shared equity scheme has divided opinion. There is strong support for it among the public. An Ibec-funded Behaviour and Attitudes survey in April found a majority of 56pc said they were in favour of the Government's shared equity scheme. About a third of those surveyed said they were interested in availing of it. But internal documents have revealed that Department of Housing officials warned that a shared equity housing scheme would lead to ""inflated house prices"" and would be an ""incentive"" for developers and ""not the purchasers"", the Sunday Business Post reported. Similar fears about shared equity scheme inflating property prices have been expressed by the Central Bank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, officials in the Department of Finance and Opposition TDs. In May, the Central Bank gave preliminary approval to the equity loan scheme, allowing banks to participate but conditional on the final terms."

McTague knew he was speaking in a minority so small that he suggested he'd be ""shot down by 99.9 per cent"". But the writing was on the wall, he said, the ""idea of weak counties ever appearing again on the big stage over"". Where else could they turn? Laois and Offaly were the same political constituency, he argued. Could they not join forces for football too? Sligo and Leitrim share political ground too. Cumulatively both counties have been on the receiving end of 44-point defeats (20 and 24 points respectively) to Mayo over two of the last three weekends. Is that a case for merging, as McTague once envisioned it? The point about recalling McTague's radical suggestion - something the former Dublin manager Pat Gilroy touched on too in a debate about the same topic last November - is to highlight that even in 2013 the system was so broken beyond repair that he was willing to put it out there. If McTague thought merging was a way forward then, what must he feel now? Of course he was talking about strengthening a county, or counties, rather an improving a competitive format. But the appetite for change, in whatever form it has been presented, has been lingering on for too long. In fact, it may never have been greater. You can set your clock for the mood to manifest more intensely during these early rounds of the championships. A straight knockout championship is only a temporary arrangement to tailor for Covid practicalities but it has only highlighted why a system based on geography should no longer be the centrepiece of a season. Rivalries that were once dictated by proximity to each other no longer have that draw. They feel tired and have fizzled out. The novelty of Tipp and Cavan successes in Munster and Ulster last year hasn't taken long to wear out either. If there was a Special Congress on any of the last three Sunday evenings, a vote for change would be a formality. But it's easier to be indignant about the need for change in these weeks than it is at those times of the year when such big decisions are www.taken.No proposal is perfect and will be met with the stock-in-trade responses. Move to tiered championships and the risk of alienation among weaker counties heightens. They'll soon be forgotten about when they move off mainstream. Merging counties, as McTague suggested, and dividing one in particular threatens to strip identity. Round-robin groups of four, based on league seedings, will still dole out painful defeats to the weak. Everywhere you turn, there's an inevitable counter argument. The more radical proposal before Spepresuming cial Congress later in the year offers a little bit of everything however, and as this summer progresses it is looking more and more, in the absence of anything better, like the best solution. It too has it flaws, presenting three opportunities to progress from the league to Division 2 teams at the expense of three Division 1 teams who are, technically deemed better than them by virtue of their higher league placing in the first instance. But there is no other way to square that particular circle unless the top 16 are spread equally over two divisions which is an option that could yet evolve. It removes the provincial championships as the season centrepiece but still retains it as a February/March early-April competition. Thus, the winners' names will still be inscribed on the roll of honour, the tradition will carry on -even offering a better chance for provincial success at a time of year when conditions can be more levelling. By switching the league to summer and offering a play-off route to an All-Ireland final for all four divisions it means every county still has an opportunity to win their province and an All-Ireland, if they are good enough. For Division 3 and 4 teams who don't progress as champions there is the 'bonus' of promotion if they win the Tailteann Cup, displacing the second team in whatever division they are in if they haven't finished second themselves. The number of guaranteed games a county will play in a season is 11, the most 18, all in a time-frame of six-and-a-half months, inclusive of pre-season preparation. Proposal The alternative proposal to switch to four provincial groups of eight, determining the eight by siphoning off the three 'weakest' in Leinster and 'weakest' in Ulster to Munster and Connacht is merely rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. For sure it offers a guarantee of more games at the right time of year but the hammerings that have been all too prevalent this year and other years will just multiply and delay the inevitable. These discussions have become a recurring theme, year after year. The chances are that, with divided opinion on both proposals 'going to post' both will be lost through lack of consensus, not a mood for change, and it will revert to pre-2018 arrangements. And those same yearly discussions will repeat right on cue. Rivalries that were once dictated by proximity to each other no longer have that draw. They feel tired and have fizzled out"

Having seen his side stun Kerry only to then be stunned by Tipperary themselves in 2020, McCarthy was always going to be wary of a Limerick team on a resurgence and playing at their own Gaelic Grounds. But after strong finishes to both halves, his side came away with a slightly inflated eightpoint win and the Cork boss was able to say: ""We got the job done. That's what we came to do."" Treaty manager Billy Lee saw his side caught for several scores on the break late on as they chased the game and he sighed: ""It wasn't so much missing chances but more of giving the ball away."" Limerick's Gordon Brown hit the day's first point but a second-minute goal eased any Cork nerves. The move also left the Treaty needing to change their goalkeeper as Donal O'Sullivan found himself concussed amid a mix-up in defence. Aaron O'Sullivan took his place. Donal O'Sullivan's last act had been to block John O'Rourke's goal effort but the same Cork forward tapped in the rebound for 1-0 to 1-1. Limerick may have feared an early Cork blitz from there, having shipped three early goals in the sides' last Championship meeting in 2019. That failed to transpire as they stayed in touch for most of the first half, only for a loss of concentration from the Division 3 side as Cork extended their lead from one point to five in the minutes coming up to half-time. After O'Rourke's goal, the impressive Hugh Bourke and Brian Hurley swapped frees. The gap stayed at two as Ian Maguire, after Bourke's free, had Cork 1-2 to 0-3 up at the water break. Defences held out against prolonged attacks when play resumed. However, after another Bourke-Hurley tit-for-tat, loose Limerick play in added time left openings for Rebels defenders Seán Powter, twice, and Mattie Taylor to stretch the visitors' advantage to 1-6 to 0-4 at half-time. Cork held their lead on the restart as O'Rourke and Danny Neville (below) exchanged scores. Hurley added another but Bourke's free and Aaron O'Sullivan's 45 brought Limerick back to within four. Hurley made it five again but it could have been back to two, only for Neville to blaze a goal chance wide after skinning the Cork backs. Sub Cian Kiely added his name to the Cork scorers' list and they led 1-11 to 0-9 at the second water break. With Cork massing back when play resumed, Limerick failed to find the goal opening they needed and were hit on the break by O'Rourke, Kiely, Hurley twice and Seán Meehan.

Allies of Tánaiste and party leader Leo Varadkar have vowed that the rebel former TD Kate O'Connell will not get a clear run at being James Geoghegan's running mate in subsequent Dublin Bay South by-elections. It had been expected the narrow win for Ivana Bacik would see a rapprochement with the colourful former TD. Instead, when it comes to finding a female running mate for Mr Geoghegan, eyes are turning to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown councillor Emma Blain. One source close to the Varadkar faction noted: 'It is still war to the knife with ""that woman"" in Leo's camp.' They noted: 'She didn't turn out once during the campaign and expects to roll back. Throw the dice again, dear. Last time I looked, this is still the Fine Gael party, not the Kate O'Connell party.' Another source noted: 'The leader is slow to anger and even slower to forgive. He sees Kate as a loose cannon who can't be trusted. It might be a leader's folly but that's his position and he's not for turning.' She is not, the source said, 'some prodigal daughter who can have her fun and then come home. There is a price to be paid for straight talking'. The 'unforgiven' status of O'Connell means party eyes are now turning towards the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown rising star Ms Blain. One source noted: 'Emma is much more our sort, a nice Protestant girl on a bike who went to [south Dublin school] Wesley.' Ms Blain is also the political protégé of Neale Richmond, the increasingly influential Dublin South Fine Gael TD. Ms Blain was selected to replace Richmond on the council after he was elected to Seanad Eireann and was subsequently comfortably elected to the Seanad. After a colourful early career as one of the Sunday Independent 03 team, Ms Blain has recently become editor of the Anglican Gazette.

For managing how we come out of the greatest health, housing, and economic threats we have faced in a century will be every bit as important as how we got through them. We face such historic challenges to surmount so anyone with a serious commitment to the future of this country must surely recognise the absurdity and utter irresponsibility of adding further uncertainty. Despite the forecast that Ireland is to have the highest government debt per head of population in Europe this year as Covid-19-related borrowings push the burden on each individual in the State up by almost (EURO)4,000 in 2021 - and despite the point that each of us will shoulder a debt burden of almost (EURO)20,000 more than the EU average - Micheál Martin once again found himself fending off questions about his security as leader of his party.

The Government hardly expects a free pass. But it's important to recognise the often-unpopular measures introduced over the past 18 months were enforced by the pandemic. The whole political agenda was hijacked and controlled by Covid. But we finally face the prospect of re-opening and agreeing our own terms as we try to transition back to normality. The mark of a substantial politician is the ability to recognise and treat trifles as trifles and important matters as important.

Frankly, I'm tired of it. Not the virus, as the virus is a fact of life. It comes at us, we raise our defences, we beat it back. It leaves behind countless stories of lives disrupted, of lives ended in heartbreaking circumstances and a long legacy of continuing illness for many. That's the reality of the virus. We deal with it or it overwhelms us. So far, we've more or less fought this to a draw, but the bloody thing doesn't respect the rules of the game and it keeps finding new ways to come at us. No, it's not the virus I'm tired of. What I'm tired of is the performance that surrounds each phase of this pandemic. The political performance, and the performances staged for commercial purposes. The script is similar each time: Nphet raises an alarm, it advises caution, the politicians throw their hands in the air, commercial interests beat their own drums and the performances get under way. Last week, TD Danny Healy-Rae denounced Nphet's latest attack on rural life, from which only Danny can defend us - Vote No1 Healy-Rae. I'm tired of the sameness of it, the cynicism and the way it obscures the reality of the very real dangers from which we have to protect ourselves. Let me give you just a few examples of last week's performances - there were lots more. Let's start with Danny. He announced in the Dáil that he had a point of order. The Ceann Comhairle wearily told him he couldn't have a point of order during Leaders' Questions, but Danny just kept talking, loudly. ""Can I ask the minister..."" ""No, you can not."" Danny kept at it: ""What has his government got against publicans in rural Ireland?"" The Ceann Comhairle pleaded: ""Deputy, please respect..."" Danny roared: ""What have you got against them? Come out and tell us. What has Dr Holohan got against them?"" So, there you have it. Thank God we pay Danny (EURO)96,000 a year, plus hefty expenses. Otherwise, we would never know that indoor dining and pubs remain closed because the Chief Medical Officer has some sort of grudge against rural publicans. That's an important point that Danny exposes: Dr Holohan doesn't hate all publicans, just rural ones. And the Government for some reason indulges Dr Holohan in his personal vendetta. This nonsense works. Danny, a wealthy rural publican, has established an electable persona as a political gladiator, defending rural people against that crowd above in Dublin. Look, don't knock it. Danny's got a lucrative market, he works it very successfully. That's what passes for politics in this sad land. Second performance. RTÉ's Prime Time needed someone who could make the case against Nphet's reading of the facts and figures of the pandemic, which led to the decision to hold off reopening indoor dining and pubs. Good, test the numbers, scrutiny is always worthwhile. After much research, during which they no doubt considered a range of statisticians and epidemiologists, Prime Time settled on TD Verona Murphy. Now, Verona is an expert on haulage. I cannot envisage circumstances in which I would need to know anything about haulage, but if I ever do, I'll be on to Verona like a shot. Mucho respecto on the haulage front, Verona. On the virus front, eh, not so much. So, what is Verona's problem with Nphet? Nothing. She's not challenging any of Nphet's figures. ""I didn't say I didn't trust the figures, I said they should be reviewed."" Verona thinks Nphet's figures should be ""peer reviewed"". She kept saying that, with the same regularity Danny says ""rural"". Now, as it happens, we know the basis for Nphet's advice on postponing the opening of indoor dining and pubs. It's contained in a letter Dr Holohan sent to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly on June 28. It's a 13-page letter, over 5,000 words. It's got lots of facts and figures and some graphs and tables. During Verona's appearance on Prime Time, as she kept repeating that the figures should be ""peer reviewed"", I wasn't convinced by anything she said that she had read the Nphet letter or was arguing with anything in it. She didn't take issue with a single decimal point. She just wanted the figures ""peer reviewed"". Verona wasn't the only one using the term. In fact, last week it sounded for a while like a chorus of TDs were chanting ""peer-review, peer-review, peer-review"". All of this gave an impression there's something terribly compromising in Nphet's mysterious figures, which no one is allowed examine. TDs want to tear down the wall of secrecy and let some ""peers"" scrutinise whatever it is Nphet is concealing Some TDs, I kid you not, demanded Nphet personally brief them. I would actually pay money to see that. As it happens, the 5,000-word Holohan letter is online at the Department of Health, as are all such letters from Nphet. Anyone can read it. Any scientist, statistician or medical expert with an interest in this matter will already have read www.it.No one has taken issue with the facts and figures. Yet the chorus of ""peer-review, peer-review"" suggests Nphet is so careless and inept it's about time some adults checked its homework. Let's put this in the quite brutal context of the past few months. Last October, Nphet read the figures and concluded we were heading for trouble. It wanted Level 5 protection, which upset the Government. Politicians hate being the bearers of bad news. The Government launched a damaging attack on Nphet, led by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, with the cooperation of Taoiseach Micheál Martin. Cheered on by commercial interests and by media fans of the government parties, politicians attempted to cast Nphet as careless, a player of political games. Mr Varadkar went on Prime Time and told the nation Nphet failed to ""think through"" its advice. Media fans were delighted the Government ""wrested back control"" from Nphet. This portrayal of a fictional struggle between heartless, unelected scientists and caring, democratic politicians was followed by the campaign to ""Save Christmas"". And soaring infection rates. People died who might not have died. Let's go no further than that. The performance now playing on the political stage is entitled ""Save Summer"". Commercial interests strut and fret throughout this production, as they are entitled to do. Last week, Michael O'Leary was strutting all over RTÉ's Drivetime. He simply talked through host Sarah McInerney, sneering and chuckling at Nphet and anyone foolish enough to listen to scientists when they could be listening to him. He's gone off a bit, though, hasn't he? Listening to him, Mick didn't seem quite up to date on the detail. He sounded like everyone's boring uncle, who's forever chattering furiously about something he read somewhere about something or other. The Nphet letter, just six days ago, warned there were 176 people awaiting admission to hospital and just 171 beds available. Of the 300 critical care beds, 258 were occupied. That's how thin the margin is, after the years of skimping on resources. That's the slack there is, should too many of us breathe into each other's faces on a crowded South William Street. Nphet is fallible, and its decisions should be, and are, open to scrutiny and open to question. However, it's tiring when the scrutiny is relentlessly aggressive, when silly accusations of careless decisions and sinister intent are thrown around by play actors on the political stage. People died who might not have died. Let's go no further than that"

The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) announced the latest bond auction on Monday. The debt is in addition to (EURO)13.25bn raised to date on the market out of a total expected debt raising of (EURO)20bn. The money is to plug the gap between the State's income and outgoings, which are running at an elevated level to fund the costs of dealing with the Covid pandemic. The most recent figures from the Department of Finance suggest a total deficit for the year of around (EURO)18bn. The debt to be raised this year is below the (EURO)24bn borrowed last year, but will still push the national debt to an unprecedented high of close to (EURO)240bn. The cost of servicing the record debt remains relatively low, however, thanks to historically low borrowing costs on the bond market, which is supported by massive bond purchases by the European Central Bank (ECB). Bets are increasingly being made on the markets that the scale of the ECB's intervention could be scaled back in order to lessen an anticipated increase in inflation. The yield, or return, investors are demanding to hold Irish 10-year bonds has risen in recent weeks but is still a very cheap 0.13pc. Yesterday, a measure of eurozone inflation expectations - the five-year, five-year inflation forward - rose to 1.606pc, its highest since May 19. Eurozone government bond yields ticked up, but analysts expect the recent downward trend to resume after last week's US payrolls data failed to tempt investors away from the safety of fixed income. A survey yesterday showed business activity in the eurozone expanding at the fastest rate in 15 years in June, as the easing of more coronavirus restrictions helped the bloc's dominant service industry. Germany's 10-year Bund yield was up by 2.6 basis points at a negative 0.209pc, while the benchmark French and Italian 10-year yields were up by 3 basis points . This pick up in eurozone yields comes after the German 10-year Bund yield dropped 8 basis points last week - its biggest weekly fall since December 2020. Analysts attributed that drop to caution about the economic impact of the Delta variant of Covid as well as expectations that the European Central Bank will be slow to withdraw support from the market even if there is evidence of inflation picking up. ""Even in a more benign Delta scenario, we now expect more restrictions on international travel, hitting the crucial tourism sector in southern Europe for a second summer,"" wrote Morgan Stanley economists in a note to clients.

Close to 5,000 housing units were started in May. The total number of housing units begun over the past 12 months is now 25,500, according to figures compiled by Davy Stockbroker economist Conall Mac Coille. However, large numbers of the new units are apartments, with most of these likely to be funded by cuckoo funds for the rental market. There were around 10,000 apartment units under construction in Dublin, the economist said. The figures on housing starts are compiled by the Department of Housing from local authorities. In a research note, Mr Mac Coille stated: ""The latest Irish housing starts data, 4,969 in May, point to activity in the construction sector bouncing back vigorously after Covid-19 restrictions were eased in April. ""Total starts in the 12 months to May equalled 25,500 - back to pre-pandemic levels."" The department's figures do not break down the number of apartments and houses that have been started. However, Mr Mac Coille added: ""There is evidence that a substantial supply response to latent housing demand is now under way, targeted at apartment development and institutional investment in the private rented sector."" He said home building activity should pick up markedly from the 20,600 completions recorded last year. Around 26,000 housing units were started last year, but lockdowns due to Covid-19 meant roughly 6,000 of these were completed. Last year, planning permission for 45,000 units was granted, of which 60pc were for apartments. They were largely in Dublin and targeted at the private rented sector. ""In our last Irish economic forecasts, we predicted housing completions would equal 21,000 in 2021, rising to 24,000 in 2022,"" Mr Mac Coille said. ""In light of the latest housing starts data, our forecasts look a little light."" He said he was likely to revise upward his forecast for housing completions closer to 25,000 for this year."

Ulster's Tom O'Toole paired up with his provincial colleague Nick Timoney for a rendition of Marvin Gaye's 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'. To pull on a green jersey for a first time at the tender age of 22, and as a tight-head prop no less, may not suggest the most arduous of climbs but the Drogheda native has had to be patient in his quest to reach this particular peak. Called into Andy Farrell's first ever Ireland camp back in the festive season of 2019, two Six Nations championships came and went as part of the squad without that elusive first run out. After his all-action display in the demolition of the USA Eagles, O'Toole was understandably thrilled. ""It was an unreal day,"" he said. ""From the moment I found out that I'd be playing I made a promise to myself that I'd enjoy it and not stress out too much. I tried to get on top of my detail pretty early and just enjoy the rest of the week. ""On a week like this, it's a very emotional week and I think you have to reflect. You know, you're getting messages from friends and family and you're thinking about your journey and how it's got to this point. ""It was a nice week for me but I wanted to put a good shift in and now the next couple of days I'll reflect that bit more. ""I just wanted to make sure I was in control and enjoying it and enjoying it with the others because some of my best mates made their first cap today as well. ""It was a special day for all of us."" Indeed on what was surely a proud day for the northern province, and more specifically their under-age structures, O'Toole was joined by James Hume, Nick Timoney and Robert Baloucoune with all four looking at home on the stage. It was perhaps the latter, though, who made the most memorable contribution in the eyes of the 6,000-strong crowd, his opening try the product of a 50-metre slalom completed at breakneck pace. ""With Rob, I've seen a lot of him in training, I've seen a lot of him in Ulster, so it's no surprise to me,"" said O'Toole, laughing when asked if he gave any thought to giving chase in support. ""You look at him and you're thinking, 'how does a guy shift like that?' ""The weight I am and the position I am, I couldn't even begin to imagine. ""It's very impressive to see and I'm massively chuffed for him because he's worked so hard for it with a few injuries setting him back but he's a wonderful player and top-class bloke so to see him move like that, express himself and show everyone what he's capable of makes me really happy for him."" For all the players who impressed in what was a performance rendered entertaining by Ireland's attacking ambition if not the strength of the opposition the challenge will be maintaining their place in Farrell's thoughts once more senior players are available. With two players selected to tour as British and Irish Lions, Andrew Porter and Tadhg Furlong, in his position, O'Toole needs no reminding that the hard work is far from over. ""When I come into the envi- ronment the next time, hopefully in a few months if I play well with my province, hopefully Tadhg and Ports will be back so it'll be competitive and it'll be nice to be with them and train with them again. ""For me it's about working hard these next few weeks, getting back in with Ulster and putting in some good performances and making sure I'm putting myself forward to be back here. It's a highly addictive environment to be in, it's competitive and you get a sense of happiness from days like today.

More worryingly, the decision not to sign up to the OECD's plan reveals a lack of self confidence in Ireland's capacity to thrive in today's digital, data-driven global economy. It is time to reassess the industrial model that has served us so well for the last 40 years. We need a new model fit for purpose for the next stage of our development.

A total of 33 new office buildings, enough for up to 30,000 workers, will be added to the capital's office stock. And, despite the rise in working from home during the pandemic, 77% of the new space is already pre-let, according to Savills. The estate agent also reported that of the new offices that came to market in 2020, more than half (53%) are now either pre-let or agreed to tenants. That compares to just 35% of the stock allocated in 2020. That modest figure reflected uncertainty due to the pandemic, but the situation is rebounding as post- Covid occupier requirements focus on new and environmental, social and governanceaccredited stock. Savills Ireland director Seán Ryan McCaffrey said: 'With negotiations ongoing on many of these 2020 buildings, we would expect this figure to rise imminently.' According to Mr McCaffrey, the office will continue to play a pivotal role for businesses in Ireland, while creating a new kind of work environment. He said: 'As we enter the reopening phase of the economy, we expect to see a continued rise in demand for space, especially new environmentally friendly buildings, as occupiers start to return to the office and formulate long-term occupational strategies.' Commercial property analyst Colm Lauder, of Goodbody Stockbrokers, said: 'Developers in the Dublin office market are generally overall very, very cautious. Hopefully, there's been a great degree of caution, a major emphasis placed on de-risking, which is, again, getting a pre-let tenant in rather than building space. It has been a trend quite consistently over the last five years, the majority of space you see under construction around you is already pre-let.' He also said that there are 'only so many investors out there who are able to finance speculative development', adding: 'That's development without a signed-up tenant. 'They're few and far between. The majority of developers in the Irish market these days require a tenant in place before they can progress with development. In the main, the risk appetite is still quite cautious. Even with a reduced office footprint because of work-from-home, we don't have the same risk of oversupply that we would have has ten years ago.' Speculative office development in Dublin is among the lowest in Europe at less than 2% of new-build offices. The trend is not unique to Ireland as a separate report from Savills predicts officeoccupiers looking for quality workspace in Europe will face tough competition for the best space despite the most active period of new office construction in five years.

The 196,000 sq m of space across 33 office buildings represents a 35pc increase on the amount of space that came to the capital's market last year. The extra space comes despite the likelihood that many office-based workplaces are likely to adopt hybrid employment models after the pandemic, with staff splitting their working time between their homes and offices. Savills said that 77pc of the new offices coming on stream this year in Dublin have already been pre-let. And of the 198,000 sq m of office space due to be delivered in 2022 in the capital, 50pc has already been pre-let, according to the property firm. ""As we enter the reopening phase of the economy, we expect to see a continued rise in demand for space, especially new environmentally friendly buildings, as occupiers start to return to the office and formulate long-term occupational strategies,"" said Sean Ryan McCaffrey, associate director at Savills. The agency said that newly-developed offices across Europe are set to provide 26pc more space this year over 2020. But average vacancy rates in cities such as Berlin, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Paris will fall below 6pc, making for competitive leasing environments. Savills also pointed out that following uncertainty that stalled take-up of new office space in 2020 due to the pandemic, that stock is being taken up by tenants. It said that 53pc of that office space that came to the market in Dublin last year is now either pre-let or agreed with occupiers. That compares to just 35pc of the stock that had been allocated during 2020. But a report from the Central Bank of Ireland last month noted that the pandemic is likely to affect the future outlook for the office sector as remote working remains a feature. ""The vacancy rate for the Dublin office market increased to over 9pc at the end of 2020 from approximately 5pc in 2019 with structural changes such as an increased instance of remote working likely to have a greater influence on the office sector over the coming years,"" the report noted. It added that following a 50pc decline in office letting activity last year in Dublin, less than 4,000 sq m of space was taken up in the first quarter of 2021. That was 63pc lower than on the previous occasion when first-quarter take-up hit an all-time low, in 2009. That was during the financial crisis. ""An increase in the willingness of companies to facilitate their staff to work remotely, accelerated by the Covid-19 shock, will likely affect requirements for office space going forward,"" the Central Bank noted. ""Much will depend on what companies and employees decide is the optimal split between working from home and time spent on site,"" it added. It warned that the Dublin office market could be at risk of oversupply, with 1.7 million sq ft of space at various stages of delivery, including being under construction, having planning permission or applying for planning.

Enclosed ""Two of the fields are enclosed by stone walls and are full of trees, which is extremely rare for the Burren,"" says Anna. ""These fields were presumably used by the nuns as an orchard and for growing other produce they needed. ""There was also a well at the top of one of the mountains, which was another reason they would have chosen to settle here. One of the fields, Pairc na Liadhas, translates into The Field of the Grey Habits."" Anna and Johnny have always kept a large herd of Hereford cattle and use a traditional, economic farming system called 'winterage'. ""We run our farm in a different way to most,"" Anna says. ""In October, we let the cattle out at the foot of the Sliabh Ghairbh Mountain and they make their own way up. They have made their own cow paths which they follow. ""The cattle stay up there until April, when we then bring them back down to lower ground for the summer months. ""Much of the ground at the top of the mountain is covered in limestone, which acts like a storage heater for the cattle. It's a dry lie for them all through the winter months, which makes it possible for us to keep them out all year round. ""We don't need any sheds or housing for our animals because of what nature has provided. This farming practice is unique to the Burren area. We also don't need to fertilise the mountain top because of the natural cows' manure."" Anna says the cattle help with the ecological process as they increase the size of the cracks in the limestone by walking and lying on it, creating more space for natural growth. ""There is an abundance of grasses, herbs and calcium-rich plants growing through the limestone, which makes for a healthy and diverse diet for the cattle. We don't need to feed them any silage or concentrates - we solely depend on nature."" Anna first opened her farm to the public last October, welcoming visitors for two-hour guided 'Camino' walks through the cow paths and teaching them about the traditional farming methods used, and about the history and heritage of the land itself. She has also been hosting Leaving Cert geography field studies. ""I've been holding a programme entitled 'Changing land uses over time'.

Mr Gunning later told the Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy that delays to the project were increasing costs, but that he could not provide a definitive update on the final bill. In his opening statement, Mr Gunning said the target date for completion is 14 months later than set out in the contract and any elongation of the programme will lead to additional costs. He said there are potential cost implications in relation to Covid-related delays and ongoing claims that have the potential to contribute to the overall costs. Mr Gunning said any discussion on costs would prejudice enforcement and would very likely negatively impact or jeopardise the board's current engagement with the contractor. He said the biggest issue at the moment is trying to get a handle on construction inflation. The committee heard that the hospital will be handed over to Children's Health Ireland (CHI) at the end of 2023, but that it is ""unlikely it would be any earlier than the second half of 2024"" before the hospital opens. Phelim Devine, project director for the hospital, said CHI will have to install equipment, clean the hospital, and 3,000 to 3,500 staff will have to be familiarised with the facility. Fiona Prendergast, director of health infrastructure at the Department of Health, told the committee that the distinctive shape of the building is now clear. ""The fit-out of certain internal areas has begun, with rooms and clinical areas now discernible,"" she said. She said that a thorough analysis of the project was sought by the Health Minister in the summer of 2020 and remains ""ongoing"". ""Therefore, a definitive update on costs cannot be provided and it would be inappropriate and likely detrimental to the project to speculate on these.""

The eye-catching design, by Taylor McCarney Architects, includes an external series of parallel field stone walls that fit within the rural setting in the west of Ireland. The surrounding landscape, including an apple tree, shed and views to the mountain Coill Chnoc Meadha, are framed within the house. Ciaran O'Connor, RIAI president, explained why the house stood out amongst strong competition. 'We have all come to realise the importance of good design in our homes over the last 16 months and this project is a prime example of this,' he said. 'People invest significant funds in their homes and this project shows how working with a registered architect can lead to quality outcomes.' The design beat off competition from a shortlist of 39 projects. Entries were received from across Ireland, including from Carlow, Cork, Dublin, Donegal, Galway, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Limerick, Louth, Offaly, Sligo, and Wicklow, as well as internationally in the UK and the Punjab, India. Second place in this year's Public Choice Award went to Bray Primary Care Centre in Co.

The homes were delivered during the boom under the Part V planning rules, which obliged developers to set aside a proportion of their developments for social and affordable housing. They were intended for homebuyers on lower incomes but when the property market crashed demand dried up. In many instances, the affordable prices were higher than open-market prices, which had plummeted. The properties were eventually acquired by local authorities and - after a period of limbo - used to house social tenants, but the EUR 371 million of debt associated with buying them remains on the councils' books. Figures provided by Mr O'Brien, in response to a parliamentary question from Sinn Féin's Eoin Ó Broin, show that a total of 2,039 unsold affordable units have been identified across 19 local authorities and are being used to house social tenants.  Cork units Cork county had the largest number (575), followed Fingal (274), Dublin city (271) and Cork city (248). The total debt-servicing costs paid on the borrowing between 2009 and 2020 was EUR 86.6 million with Cork city paying the most (EUR 20.5 million). Fingal and Dublin city paid EUR 17.5 million to service the debt. Mr O'Brien said he had established a working group comprising officials from various State housing bodies to examine the issue and his department was consulting with local authorities and the Housing Finance Agency to gather the relevant financial data.  ""Once completed, the next meeting of the working group will consider the options available for resolving this legacy issue,"" he said. Part V of the Planning and Development Act currently requires 10 per cent of new housing developments to be earmarked to meet wider social needs with local authorities entitled to obtain it at existing-use value.  Mr O'Brien intends to increase that portion to 20 per cent, possibly comprising 10 per cent social housing and 10 per cent affordable housing or a mix dictated by the local authority. Several issues The 2,039 unsold affordable units remain one of several issues still outstanding from the crash.  ""The State was never meant to acquire these units and now there's an issue around who is going to pay for them,"" Mr Ó Broin said. ""The Government is now returning to the 20 per cent Part V obligation, which will include affordable units - that's a good thing - but we need to make sure that something is built into it that doesn't repeat this mistake if there is another property downturn,"" he said. Separately, the first homes to be delivered under the Government's new cost-rental tenure model were launched yesterday by housing agency Clúid. The 25 properties in Balbriggan, north County Dublin, will be rented to qualifying tenants at sub-market rates of between EUR 935 and EUR 1,150 a month. Under the scheme, rents for the homes are set at a minimum of 25 per cent below market values."

Ministers will meet to discuss the new hospitality laws which will then go before the Dail and Seanad this week and come into force at some stage next week. Under the new regulations, people who are fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid in the past nine months will be allowed to go inside a pub or restaurant. Children under the age of 18 who are not vaccinated will also be allowed inside a bar or restaurant as long as they are accompanied by a fully vaccinated adult. Chief Executive of the Restaurants Association, Adrian Cummins, last night said the new laws will help get 180,000 people back to work in the hospitality sector. He said: ""It's imperative we build on the progress to date over the weeks ahead. The Government must now roll out a national information campaign for consumers and hospitality businesses. ""Finally, we welcome the inclusion of Northern Ireland, UK and US customers to dine indoors once verifiable proof of vaccination is provided.""

The (EURO)1,000 grant is aimed at enabling people to take short-term courses to improve their chances of getting work. As part of the new strategy, the Government will also be offering employers a grant of between (EURO)7,500 and (EURO)10,000 for every person they hire that is under 30 and has been unemployed for more than 12 months. The recruitment subsidy, which will be paid out over two years to businesses, is aimed at reducing the number of young people in long term unemployment. The current youth unemployment level stands at 44 per cent - which includes workers on the PUP. The Government is aiming to cut this rate down to at least 12.5 per cent by 2023 using the new Pathways To Work strategy. Minister Humphreys is also planning to announce today that her Department is developing a new pay-related Jobseekers Benefit.

Peter Burke, Junior Planning Minister, has staunchly defended the right of people to build one-off houses in rural areas as official figures show an average of 4,500 single dwellings have been built in Ireland every year for the past five years. ""Rural housing has consistently accounted for 25pc of our annual housing output and 5,000 new homes per annum in recent years, but some will assert that it's an endangered commodity, an argument which has emotive roots,"" Mr Burke, a Fine Gael TD, writes in today's Sunday Independent. ""As someone from a rural constituency and raised on a family farm, I want to put on the record that the Government recognises the importance of rural housing and its value both to our supply and to sustaining rural communities."" Mr Burke's position that one-off housing should continue to account for a significant amount of housing to be delivered over the coming years puts him at odds with coalition colleagues in the Green Party. His fellow Junior Minister in the Department of Housing, the Green Party TD Malcolm Noonan, has been heavily critical of single dwellings in the past. Mr Noonan has previously described one-off housing as a ""fundamentally flawed policy"" and a ""ticking time bomb of rural isolation"". He believes that allowing for such developments makes it extremely expensive for local authorities and other agencies to provide roads, waste collections services, groundwater pollution, electricity, lighting, postal services and broadband. Speaking to the Sunday Independent this weekend, Mr Noonan said he sees a ""diminishing role"" for one-off housing over time. Meanwhile, Mr Burke writes this weekend that the majority of the State's 31 local authorities have to more than double their housing output every year over the next six years in order to meet government targets. Figures showing average annual housing completions in each local authority area between 2017 and 2020 reveal Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick will need to increase their number of annual average house completions by 250pc over the next six years. The number of housing completions in Sligo needs to increase by 444pc and in Longford by 386pc to meet targets set down by the Coalition, with only Meath not requiring any increase in the coming years based on its housing output since 2017. ""Almost every single one of our local authorities must increase housing output, and 22 out of 31 local authorities have to increase their housing output by more than 100pc per annum over the next six years. They must double what they have been delivering in recent years and provide enough zoned land to do so,"" Mr Burke writes. Mr Noonan said there cannot be continued expansion of one-off housing and said the focus should be on building capacity within existing housing stock and ""unlocking the potential"" of towns and villages by making it attractive for families to live there. ""We would be of the view that we need to build capacity in towns and villages where there is already infrastructure and access to public transport,"" Mr Noonan said. ""One-off housing will create a really challenging future in terms of older people and isolation. It creates all sorts of challenges for local authorities, even down to collection of waste and postal services. We really need to focus on clustering houses if we are really focused on town centres first. ""I would certainly be of the view that we can't have both - we can't have a continued expansion of one-off rural housing and have ambitions to build capacity in towns and villages."" Mr Burke is leading the Town Centres First plan to encourage people to live in smaller towns and villages by making greater use of derelict lands and buildings across the country. But he has insisted there has been no change in policy on rural housing. ""I expect it to continue to play a vital role in the accommodation of our people for years to come, and nothing I have seen or heard in Custom House over the past year has negatively affected my outlook on this,"" he writes, referring to the base of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Figures provided to this newspaper show there were 22,500 single dwellings built in Ireland between 2016 and 2020, with permission granted for nearly 26,000 over the same period. This amounts to on average 28 oneoff houses per 1,000 people aged 25 to 39 in Ireland, according to CSO data. A breakdown by local authority area shows striking regional variations. Cork county accounted for 2,628 single dwelling completions between 2016 and 2020, the most of any local authority area. There were 1,954 in the Galway county local authority area in the same period, 1,423 in Donegal, 1,327 in Meath, 1,219 in Wexford, 1,142 in Mayo, and 1,053 in Kerry. By contrast, over the last five years there were just over 1,000 one-off houses in all built across the five local authority areas of Cork city, South Dublin, Longford, Leitrim and Galway city.

A 53-year-old man, believed to be the partner of the victim, was being questioned last night after being arrested on suspicion of murder. Police said the woman and the man had been on holiday in the popular tourist area on the banks of the River Roe a few miles outside Limavady. The number of tourists arriving in the area had increased since lockdown restrictions ended, and last weekend's Stendhal Arts and Music Festival, held just outside Limavady, brought 2,500 visitors to the town. Police forensic experts remained on the scene at Swanns Bridge Glamping site at Sea Coast Road throughout yesterday. It is an area popular with tourists, hikers and watersports enthusiasts. Police said they were called to the scene on Monday evening following a report that a woman had been stabbed Paramedics were unable to save her. ""We received a report, just after 8.20pm on Monday, that a woman had been stabbed at an outdoor accommodation site on Sea Coast Road,"" PSNI Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell said.

The company founded by Irish entrepreneurs Patrick and John Collison has consistently downplayed suggestions it intends to go public. However, a report from Reuters indicates Stripe has tapped Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton as a legal adviser on early-stage listing preparations. There has been no decision on the timing of any stock-market debut, according to sources quoted by Reuters and the next step would be the hiring of investment banks later this year. The listing would be unlikely to happen this year, two of the sources added. Stripe, which has headquarters in both Silicon Valley and Dublin, is considering going public through a direct listing, rather than a traditional IPO, because it does not need to raise money, two of the sources said, cautioning that those plans could change. The sources requested anonymity. Stripe and Cleary Gottlieb declined to comment. Stripe, which was founded in 2010, became the most valuable private company in Silicon Valley earlier this year after a new fundraising round in March that valued it at $95 billion (EUR 80 billion). It reportedly secured a further $1 billion in investment last month after offering investors the chance to purchase shares from early backers and employees past and present. Private status Remaining private has enabled Stripe to keep financial details such as revenue and profitability under wraps. However, is has also deprived the business of the opportunity to use its shares as a publicly traded currency to help finance acquisitions and to incentivise employees. Stripe processes hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions every year for millions of businesses worldwide. Its list of clients includes Google, Uber, Amazon and Zoom. The company employs more than 2,500 people globally, including more than 300 in Dublin.  It set up an international engineering hub here in early 2018 and recently announced plans to take on up to 1,000 staff. The hub is playing an increasingly important role. Stripe Tax, a new product aimed at helping businesses automatically calculate and collect tax, was developed here.

There were angry scenes at London's Heathrow Airport in the morning as passengers crammed into Terminal 5 after dozens of security staff did not turn up for work because they had been 'pinged' by an NHS app. Travellers said it took 90 minutes just to drop off their bags and get through security. Dozens of flights were delayed by up to three hours to allow people to board, with some missing their flights. Passengers said that at one point, there were just two security lanes open for thousands of travellers. Heathrow said the chaos was due to staff being 'pinged' and ordered to self-isolate by the NHS app. Staff from different shift patterns were brought into clear the backlog by the afternoon. Meanwhile, dozens of trains were cancelled due to staff shortages. Great Western Railway, which runs long-distance trains between London, Devon, Cornwall and South Wales, was among the worst affected. It said a reduced timetable was running yesterday because of 'a shortage of train crew' due to 'a significant number of staff having to self-isolate following notification from Test and Trace'. Several Thameslink services connecting Cambridge with Gatwick airport were also cancelled. National Rail said there were cancellations and alterations to services 'across the railway network' due to staff shortages. The fiasco will increase pressure on UK ministers to water down Britain's controversial self-isolation system. There are growing fears that continuing to order people to selfisolate after being in close proximity with a Covid carrier will cripple the British economy and public services this summer. Ministers in the UK want the public to continue self-isolating when 'pinged' for a month after Freedom Day on Monday. But thousands, including Tory MPs, have deleted the app to avoid disruption to their lives. Yesterday at Heathrow, passengers began posting pictures and videos of a packed Terminal 5 from 7am. Among those caught up in the chaos was Grammy-winning violinist, Nicola Benedetti. Posting a video of snaking queues, she tweeted: 'No one can tell us if our flights will be delayed or if we're about to miss them. Zero information - it's just awful.'

Developed originally by Harry Crosbie, the scheme known formerly as Point Village, is being offered for sale by Savills on behalf of joint statutory receivers Stephen Tennant and Paul McCann of Grant Thornton, at a guide price of EUR 75 million. The Point Square scheme comprises some 103,000sq ft of office space, a 242,000sq ft shopping centre which incorporates a 95,000sq ft anchor store, over 61,000sq ft of space with planning permission for retail and/or leisure use, a six-screen cinema let to Odeon, 756 car parking spaces and 24,000sq ft of permitted café/restaurant space - home to various food and beverage operators including Starbucks, Eddie Rockets, Ruby's, Salad Box and Freshii. In addition, Crossfit 353 have opened a gym in the scheme.  The sale is also set to include the Glass Box, situated in Point Square, Dublin's first 'glass box' restaurant which is nearing completion and currently available to let. While the 252-bedroom Gibson Hotel, owned by Deka Immobilien and operated by Dalata, forms part of the wider scheme, this, together with the 95,000sq ft anchor store owned by Dunnes Stores, are held separately via long-leasehold interests and are not included in the sale. Point Square is well-located within Dublin's thriving north docklands. The scheme is situated immediately adjacent to Live Nation's hugely-successful 3 Arena, a venue which ordinarily hosts more than 100 concerts a year, and within a short walk of Point Campus Student Accommodation, a development comprising 966 student accommodation beds, acquired by German investor DWS in 2019. The development is also located next to Dublin's tallest office building, the Exo, which is under construction. Due for completion in the third quarter of this year, some 100,000sq ft of the 17-storey building's 169,000sq ft of office accommodation is set to be occupied by An Post following the relocation of its headquarters from the GPO on O'Connell Street. Office-led developments  Outside of its immediate vicinity, Point Square is surrounded by a number of other large-scale office-led developments including Dublin Landings, the one million square foot scheme delivered by Sean Mulryan's Ballymore and its partners, Oxley; Spencer Place - Ronan Group Real Estate's mixed-use development comprising 379,000sq ft of Grade A office accommodation (pre-let to Salesforce) and 329 apartments; and TIO's North Dock, which comprises a 241-bedroom aparthotel and two Grade A office buildings extending to 200,000sq ft. Point Square should also benefit from its proximity to the planned Pembroke Quarter. The development of the former Irish Glass Bottle site is expected to deliver 3,800 new homes and over one million sq ft of commercial space. While Savills say they consider Point Square to be one of the best asset management and value-add opportunities to come to the market in Dublin in recent years, the scheme is already generating rental income of EUR 4.9 million. The majority of this - 80 per cent - is being derived from the offices occupied by Oath (Yahoo!) and Voxpro. These offices are let at an average passing rent of EUR 36 per sq ft, offering reversionary potential, and have a weighted average unexpired lease term of 2.7 years.  A feasibility study prepared in advance of the sale suggests that there is potential, subject to planning permission, to add extra floors to the office block.  Commenting on the proposed sale, Fergus O'Farrell, investment director at Savills said: ""Point Square offers investors a rare opportunity to put in place an innovative and exciting asset management strategy while collecting significant rent roll. The retail component of Point Square offers buyers a blank canvas to put their stamp on this project, situated in an area that has undergone transformational change in recent years and where the likes of Microsoft, Salesforce and the Central Bank call home along with 25,000 residents."""

The main event at UFC 264 had been billed as the rubber match in a trilogy, and the record books will show that Poirier won by technical knockout. But that doesn't explain what really happened. With the first round in its latter stages and both fighters trading blows, McGregor fell to the floor as his left ankle snapped. The TV commentators would label it a ""horror injury"". Floored and physically incapable of standing back up, McGregor braced for impact as Poirier seized on his opportunity to finish the job. He lunged forward, hitting his opponent with a combination of unanswered blows. All the Dubliner could do was protect his head with his hands. Mercifully, the clock ran down. He had been saved by the bell. Within seconds, referee Herb Dean called an end to the contest on medical grounds. McGregor would remain propped up against the octagon until he was stretchered away. For the capacity crowd in the 20,000-seater arena - including former US President Donald Trump - it was not what they had come to see. ""I was boxing the bleedin' head off him,"" said McGregor, a picture of frustration slouched against the cage. ""This is not over. If I have to take this outside, I'll take it outside. I don't give a b****x."" He had some good moments during the five minutes of action, such as when he gained the upper hand and attempted to lock in a guillotine choke. However, to suggest he dominated is way off the mark. If anything, Poirier had the better of proceedings. UFC president Dana White stated that a fourth fight is likely. ""The fight didn't get finished,"" said White. ""You can't have a fight finish that way. Poirier will do his thing until Conor is ready."" Poirier's ""thing"" will probably be a lightweight title fight against Charles Oliveira. After more than a year of almost exclusively staging fights in empty venues, Saturday night's event at T-Mobile Arena saw the return of paying spectators. Gate receipts of $16.7m ((EURO)14.1m) made it one of the highest-grossing shows in UFC history. Money from pay-per-view sales is expected to push total income for UFC 264 close to the (EURO)100m mark. McGregor's immediate focus turns to rehabilitating his broken ankle. One can only hope he also uses the time to reflect. Not for the first time, aspects of his conduct in the build-up to a fight were disappointing. McGregor stated that he would ""murder"" his opponent. It was a remark Poirier, a father-of-one, took exception to. ""Murder is something you don't clown around with and there is no coming back from that. This guy was telling me he was going to murder me and I was going to leave here in a coffin. ""You don't talk to people like that. I hope this man gets home safely to his beautiful family."" Fighter When Poirier beat McGregor in Abu Dhabi back in January, the Dubliner was gracious in defeat, describing his opponent as ""one hell of a fighter"". However, he would revise that view. During last Thursday's press conference, he said: ""He's Buster Douglas. It was a fluke win and I'm going to correct it on Saturday night."" When James 'Buster' Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in their heavyweight title fight of 1990, it was - and remains - one of the biggest shocks in boxing history. So unfancied was Douglas that some bookmakers offered odds of 42/1 about him beating Tyson. Last year, the 30th anniversary of that upset, was marked by countless nostalgia pieces in the print and television media. There will be no special commemorations of Poirier's convincing win over McGregor six months ago. It was neither a fluke nor a shock. On Saturday night, he merely underlined his superiority.

The decision to delay reopening parts of the economy will not help, of course, although it remains to be seen whether this is a short-term hiatus or something more serious. Either way, the pressures of pandemic spending have pushed total expenditure this year to around EUR 90 billion; had there been no pandemic it might have been around EUR 75 billion. We saw on Tuesday the practical difficulties of maintaining the path to reopening. And this only increases the challenge of managing the running down of emergency spending in the months ahead. One of the key jobs is to replace the general financial supports - of which the largest are the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the wage subsidy scheme - with spending focused on the hardest hit sectors. This is technically complex and politically fraught.  The wider point is the need for more clarity on the appropriate level of spending as Ireland exits the pandemic. Phasing out the temporary Covid-19 spending would leave some leeway for the Government as it faces significant spending pressures in the years ahead. Many ministers are likely to fight to retain their pandemic allocations, arguing that the money can be reallocated.  While Taoiseach Micheál Martin and the ministers for finance and public expenditure told the NED that trade-offs and prioritisation lie ahead, there is little sign yet of this influencing the political debate. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) has repeatedly cautioned that existing spending plans have already eaten up any room for manoeuvre from a rebound in growth. Massive spending was the correct response to the pandemic, but Ireland cannot continue to borrow the guts of EUR 20 billion every year. A vital few weeks lie ahead. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is due to publish a Summer Economic Statement, which is to include some targets for the deficit and the public finances. It will be interesting to see how this is framed. In turn, it will help to set the context as the budget for 2021 approaches in October. There are important decisions needed on the appropriate path for the public finances. Work by the Department of Finance and IFAC has indicated that on reasonable assumptions, there should be no need to return to a period of austerity spending cuts and tax hikes. Equally, the Government has set out a lot of spending plans and faces pressures from an ageing population and decisions have to be made on how to pay for these, via spending savings elsewhere or new revenues. The Summer Economic Statement needs to set out a framework for these decisions and a basis to plan for the future."

The 84-year-old pope, who had part of his colon removed in the surgery, stepped out on the balcony of his suite on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital to lead his weekly prayer before hundreds of cheering people below. He stood for about 10 minutes, reading from a prepared text but also adding many impromptu remarks. He appeared to be slightly short of breath at times and his voice was occasionally raspy.  Shaky  The pope had part of one of his lungs removed when he was a young man in his native Argentina. Hundreds of people gathered in the open space below shouted ""Viva il papa!"" (Long live the pope) and waved national flags. Doctors and patients stood on other balconies to watch. ""It was a great joy to see the pope again . . . his voice was a little shaky but the pope is always the pope and we wanted to be here,"" said an Italian priest who identified himself as Fr Massimiliano. In the mostly improvised part of his talk, Francis said good healthcare should be accessible to all and free. ""In these days that I have been in hospital, I saw once more how important it is to have a good healthcare system that is accessible to all, as it exists in Italy and in other countries,"" he said. ""A health service that is free and guarantees good service accessible to all . . . This precious good should not be lost. It must be maintained and everyone should be committed to this. Because everyone needs it . . .,"" he said. According to the World Health Organisation, universal health coverage means that all have access to health services they need without financial hardship. Several children who are patients in the hospital appeared with the pope on the balcony. ""Why children have to suffer is [a question] that touches the heart,"" he said. It was the first time since his election as pope in 2013 that Francis has not read the Sunday prayer and message from a window overlooking St Peter's Square, except for when he was travelling. Difficulty  Francis criticised managers of church-run hospitals whose first thought, he said, is to close when economic difficulty hits. ""Your vocation as a church is not to have money but to be of service, and service is always free,"" he said in part of his unprepared remarks. Before closing with his traditional final remark of ""Have a good lunch and goodbye until we see each other again,"" Francis appealed for an end to ""the spiral of violence"" in Haiti, where the president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated on Wednesday. - Reuters"

The bosses of industrial firms, including tyre company Michelin and construction materials producer Saint- Gobain, say they are facing scarce supplies, transport bottlenecks and staff shortages in the wake of the pandemic, and they expect consumer-price inflation to pick up as a result. ""We usually have one or two operational crises to handle at a time on supplies - right now we have 23,"" Michelin chief executive officer Florent Menegaux told Bloomberg TV. ""The entire supply chain has been disturbed."" The concerns raised at the annual Aix-en-Provence conference highlight the uncertainty surrounding Europe's rebound from the deepest peacetime recession in a century. Shops, restaurants and leisure facilities are finally reopening as vaccinations gain pace across Europe, but uneven progress in combating the coronavirus around the world has left supply chains damaged and workers hard to find. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde, who attended the conference, told France Inter radio that while the euro-region economy is ""clearly in a period of recovery"" and may reach its pre-pandemic size sooner than expected, current price pressures are ""mostly transitory"". Still, ECB executive board member Isabel Schnabel noted upside risks to inflation in a speech in Germany on Saturday - though she said that may be necessary to escape from years of weak prices and low growth. Dutch central bank President Klaas Knot said he worries that policymakers may be underestimating the risk of too-high inflation becoming entrenched. Speaking yesterday at the conference, Bank of France governor François Villeroy de Galhau raised another difficulty with inflation: measuring it. He noted that while changes in prices are often overestimated by households, the ECB has not taken into account the pressure from housing costs. ""Better accounting for housing costs is very important,"" Mr Villeroy said. ""It's one of the things that we must change in the strategic review of monetary policy that we are in the process of concluding."" Pricing and shipping delays also bear close monitoring, according to French industry minister Agnes Pannier- Runacher. ""We have some factories that have to slow down their production, they have a huge backlog, but they don't have the parts to produce,"" she said in a Bloomberg TV interview. Michelin has raised tyre prices twice since the start of the year, Mr Menegaux said, noting that the cost of shipping containers between Singapore and the US has jumped to about $9,800 ((EURO)8,013) currently from $2,400 in 2019. ""In the end, customers will pay,"" he said. Air Liquide SA chief executive officer Benoit Potier said the bottlenecks will take as long as two years to work themselves out. ""This goes much deeper than just pent-up demand,"" said Saint-Gobain chief executive officer Benoit Bazin. He has had to make quick changes to supply chains to keep factories operating, at one point importing from Indonesia a product that was temporarily unavailable near a plant in Texas. ""It was expensive, but we couldn't do it otherwise and this is creating inflation,"" he said. ""The big issue this year is availability, both of staff and raw materials."" Demand is also being sustained by government stimulus plans, including the European Union's (EURO)800bn recovery fund, which is focused on making the post-pandemic economy greener and more digitised. The French government is pouring incentives into renovating buildings to make them more energy efficient. Mr Bazin said it takes six to nine months to book builders in France now, and that the situation will likely be prolonged as Europe's climate goals lead to a doubling in the rate of renovations this decade. Some companies fear they will suffer even more as they struggle to pass higher costs onto customers. Orange SA chief executive officer Stephane Richard told Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the conference that tight competition in telecoms means it has to absorb cost increases. ""Inflation to us is yet another constraint that pushes us to be more productive, to reduce our costs,"" he said. ""Inflation isn't good news for the telecommunications sector.""

An agreement between one of the country's oldest institutions and a bullion dealership, has paved the way for Irish-branded gold bars to go on general sale for the first time.

Nigel Doolin, head of trading at Core Bullion Traders, said: 'Many gold buyers are very particular about the countries and brands that they buy. 'We have clients who won't buy gold from certain countries and people who, for example, will only buy American-branded gold bullion,' he said. 'This will open up a new commercial market for Irishbranded gold bars - especially for members of the diaspora who want a long-term investment with a tie to their heritage and country. 'We also see a big market in people marking special occasions with a unique gift that is also a quality investment. 'Origin is important when buying gold bullion, and we search the world for quality precious metals brands to bring to the Irish market - to date, we have been very successful in bringing other new gold products to Ireland.' He said: 'However, we have been actively seeking an Irish brand to support and are delighted to have reached agreement with the Assay Office to be an authorised retailer of these Dublin Assay Office investment bars.' The ongoing performance of gold as an investment puts it in an appreciating low-risk asset category, according to Mr Doolin. 'A lot of younger retail investors have entered the market this year, generally deciding between investing in either gold or cryptocurrencies,' he said. 'However, it must be understood that they are completely different financial tools.

You can have legitimate complaints about health advice and how it was translated into policy by Government. You can also say that some specific sectors were not supported enough, such as live entertainment and aviation. Overall, the Government did dig deep. The very first employee and business supports announced at the start of the crisis were a little thin. But very quickly the Government realised the pandemic had changed the economic landscape globally and a serious and sustained intervention was needed. In other words the paradigm in Government shifted quite early. By the end of April 2021 the various support schemes had cost in the region of (EURO)15.5bn. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and its successor, the EWSS, together cost (EURO)5.8bn, with almost half-a-billion euro in PRSI foregone. The CRSS which provided cash directly to firms cost around (EURO)500m with a further (EURO)2.3bn of tax debt warehoused. The PUP has cost a further (EURO)6bn. As the positive effects of the vaccine programme take hold, what should the Government paradigm be now or further on into 2022? Various interest groups seem to believe the crisis paradigm should persist because without extensions to several supports, some businesses will falter, perhaps when they were quite close to coming out the far side. Financial advisory group PwC published its pre-Budget submission during the week and it reads as a very comprehensive multi-faceted wish list. It wants to see the wage-subsidy scheme extended for almost another year. It wants to waive income tax and USC clawbacks for employees who received supports. It also wants to reduce the interest rate on late payment of taxes and extend tax debt warehousing. Covid crisis Minister for Finance Paschal everyone Donohoe will find it difficult come October to push back on the clamour for help from some sectors about how they are still suffering. How do you continue to help hotels when some of them will be packed to the rafters with staycationers this summer, while others remain quite empty? Already some hotels are talking about needing help in 2022, when they expect very few Irish people to holiday in Ireland for a third year in a row. But whatever about struggling businesses in badly-affected sectors, in reality many other private Irish businesses have thrived during the pandemic. The PwC submission was prepared in conjunction with the Family Business Network. And yes, family businesses remain the backbone of employment and commercial life in small towns all over Ireland. There seems to be a mood about that the old crisis paradigm in Government, combined with enormous sums of cheap money available to borrow on bond markets, makes the finance minister look like a bit of soft touch this autumn. Pre-Budget submissions are moving well beyond Covid support extensions to a raft of things which would benefit lots of businesses that are actually doing quite well. Remote working presents challenges and opportunities for both employees and employers. Workers are looking forward to the greater flexibility and reduced commutes that a hybrid working model can bring. Businesses can sense the opportunity in remote working to slash their rental overheads and benefit from greater workforce flexibility. But who should pay for investment in IT that might be required to facilitate home working? The PwC submission wants the Government to introduce a time-limited enhanced upfront deduction of 130pc for capital expenditure incurred by employers on IT equipment required for remote working. It wants tax breaks for employee share ownership and a relaxation of employers' PRSI for an initial 12-months if a firm hires someone who has been unemployed as a result of Covid-19 restrictions. By the end support cost in the (EURO)15.5bn Businesses that have done well during the last 14 months are preparing for further growth. They will hire as part of that process and probably don't need the kind of tax breaks proposed here. Other wish list items are emerging too around reducing capital gains tax and inheritance tax where entrepreneurs pass on their wealth to family members. Admittedly, these are hardy annuals at budget time. Another wish list item is around energy performance in new plant and machinery where businesses are looking for a super deduction of up to 130pc of capital expenditure. If Mr Donohoe extends some key Covid supports, it will come at a cost. As long as they can be targeted to sectors and businesses that most need them, there is a compelling case for lengthening those supports. But the additional cost will have to be found elsewhere. This means more borrowing, more tax or less spending. Take your pick. The post-Covid economy is actually quite complex and nuanced. It isn't crisis mode for everyone, yet some sectors will experience long Covid. From a government point of view, they can't be seen to remain in ongoing crisis mode well into 2022 because crisis mode exchequer spending isn't sustainable no matter how low the rate of borrowing. Yet, the Government cannot abandon swathes of economic activity where business may still be struggling next year. Politically, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are poised for a backlash on housing. They know after years of mistakes the pressure is piling on them to fix the housing situation. A wish list from businesses which have come through the pandemic quite well, won't be high on their agenda.

He was found guilty and sentenced to death. The Bourbon Line was restored for a time under Louis XVI's brothers, Louis XVIII (r.1814-1824) and finally Charles X, King of France from 1824-1830. Legitimists believe that the Bourbons are the last true kings of France. The Legitimist movement is led by Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou (born 1974), who pretends to the title of Louis XX of France. His own claim to the French throne is based upon his descent from Louis XIV of France (r. 1643-1715) through his grandson Philip V of Spain. According to the Legitimists, all male descendants of Hugh Capet, King of the Franks from 987-996, in the legitimate male line are dynasts of the Kingdom of France. Under these conditions there are probably hundreds of would-be princes. In 1830, the July Revolution overthrew Charles X, who abdicated in favour of his ten-year-old grandson, Henri, Duke of Bordeaux. However, his regent Louis-Philippe, Duke of Chartres, who was sworn in as King Louis-Philippe I, was also forced to abdicate in 1848. His supporters are known as Orléanists and they consider Jean, Count of Paris (b.1965) the legitimate claimant to the throne of France as Jean IV. Oliver Cowan, St Helier, Jersey. QUESTION Was Elvis Presley's Heartbreak Hotel based on a true story? HEARTBREAK Hotel was written in 1955 by Mae Boren Axton and guitarist Tommy Durden. Axton was known in the music industry as the Queen Mother of Nashville and wrote many songs including Pick Me Up On Your Way Down for Patsy Cline and Honey Bop for Wanda Jackson. Axton introduced the 19-year-old Elvis to Colonel Tom Parker, who became his manager for the rest of his life. Tommy Durden, a musician from Gainesville, Florida, presented the idea for the song to Axton after Compiled by Charles Legge reading an article in the Miami Herald, asking: 'Do you know this man?' about an unidentified, welldressed John Doe who had killed himself, leaving behind only the message, 'I walk a lonely street'. Compiled by Charles Legge They wrote a blues song centred around this unfortunate man. They expanded it to include a stanza describing how the man's family would feel when they discovered his death and came up with the idea of a 'heartbreak hotel'. Legend has it the song took just 22 minutes to write. Compiled by James Black They recorded a demo tape with Glen Reeves mimicking Presley's voice. Elvis first heard the song when attending a disc jockey conference in Nashville in November 1955 and vowed to record it. For the track, Elvis tried to recreate the distinctive sound he'd developed in the Sun Studio in Memphis early in his career and went for a heavy echo on the vocals. In fact, Elvis recorded part of the song in the stairwell of the RCA building in Nashville to get the sound they wanted. It was Elvis's first US Number One and one of the greatest rock 'n' roll hits of all time. The song was released on January 27, 1956. Elvis performed the tune several times on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey's CBS variety series Stage the song on NBC's popular The Milton Berle Show. The single hit Number One on the Billboard chart on April 21 and remained at the top for eight weeks. The record has achieved sales of more than 18million copies to date.

NON-STICK pans and, to a lesser extent, plastic materials such as Tupperware retain water as the surface is coated with a hydrophobic layer that repels water, so the water will form beads. Because the contact angle between water and the hydrophobic material is higher, it causes rounder drops to form, while hydrophilic material has the water spread out flatter on it. With more surface area, the sheets of water on hydrophilic materials, such as glass and china, evaporate faster than the drops of water on a hydrophobic surface. It should be noted that unless the manufacturer specifically states that an item is dishwasher safe, you should never put cookware with a non-stick coating in the dishwasher. Over time, the dishwashing process can break down the coating, ruining the nonstick finish. Jane Marsden, Nottingham. QUESTION What role did the British army's royal engineers secretly play on the French beaches in the hours before D-Day? THE 1st Assault Brigade of the royal engineers had been formed in 1943 for the sole purpose of clearing obstructions from the landing beaches on D-Day. It was made up of the 5th and 6th Assault Regiments, each of which was made up of four assault squadrons. Two squadrons were assigned to each of the British and Canadian invasion beaches, which were called (from east to west) Sword, Juno and Gold. Their role was to go ashore with remove beach obstacles; disarm and remove mines and other explosive charges; breach the sea wall; create and maintain ramps for and remove any obstructions that they saw. Each beach had to have a total of eight exit routes established by the assault engineers. The assault squadrons were also equipped with 'flail' tanks, which had chains mounted on a rotating drum at the front of the tank that beat the ground ahead of it to explode mines. After D-Day, the 1st Assault remained in Europe and took part in operations up to and including the crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945. There were some men who went ashore ahead of the first wave, but these were Royal Navy and Royal Marine divers. The men were from the Landing Craft Obstruction Clearance Units (LCOCUs). Each LCOCU was made up of an officer and 11 men. There were ten LCOCUs in total, four RN and six RM, spread across the three landing beaches. Because the divers needed both hands free to work underwater, they were unarmed. At 20 minutes before H-Hour 7.25am on June 6), the divers swam ashore from their landing craft. They carried explosives which they attached to the obstructions. To protect them against the underwater blasts, the divers wore wetsuits with a kapok lining to absorb the shock.

With its distinctive pagoda-style roof, steel balustrades and ornate ironwork the 1899 structure stands out.  In 2017 the sensitive restoration of the open shelter was highly commended in the Irish Georgian Society's conservation awards and last year the Market House took on a whole new lease of life when a weekly farmers market featuring local produce commenced, almost by stealth, in the middle of a pandemic. John Egan, of Ratheniska Farm Fresh, jokes that the market just sprang up overnight. But that's not quite the case. For many years a successful weekly country market had operated from a nearby church hall, but that had closed in March 2020 because of Covid. With its open sides the Market House is the perfect place for such a venture, protected from the elements while also out of doors. A number of traders approached Laois County Council, with the support of the Cosby family, owners of the Market House (and nearby Stradbally Hall, home of Electric Picnic), about setting up an outdoor market and arrangements were made to allow trading commence every Friday from 2pm to 5pm. Twins Kate and Ruth O'Hara (24), from Durrow, were prompted by the pandemic to leave their careers in accounting and finance to follow their passion and set up Temptations Patisserie. They make their delicious chocolate, truffles, bonbons and macaroons in a rented industrial kitchen unit at Mountmellick Development Association and sell at the market. ""We've turned our hobby into a business and we're self taught,"" explains Ruth. Driving force  John Egan is the driving force behind the market having developed his gardening hobby into a multigenerational family business. What he didn't know, he found out through YouTube tutorials and Ratheniska Farm Fresh now has seven poly tunnels, with two more planned for their production of fresh vegetables, and they also sell eggs from their own chickens. The aim is to provide local produce, promote a cleaner environment and to help build a self-sustaining local economy, he says. Teresa Fingleton and her granddaughter Keeva, of Stradbally Country Bakers, are also from Ratheniska. They offer a wide range of baked goods, chutneys, marmalades and jams - all made from local fruits, some grown, some gathered. ""We've had all sorts of weather [at the market], but it doesn't make a difference because we're covered,"" says Teresa. Carmel McLoughlin of Abbey Nurseries was also being assisted by a granddaughter - Ava Campbell (8). Carmel grew up in Stradbally and now lives in Nurney where she grows the plants herself and sells them all year round. ""It is very seasonal. In winter it's cyclamen, pansies and violas and we did a very good trade in Christmas wreaths last year."" Abbey Nurseries also offer a service whereby they will put plants on a grave for a family who cannot do so themselves. Elizabeth Bradley of Carlow Farmhouse Cheese is a market veteran. She used to be a dry-stock farmer but circumstances led her to making her own cheese from sheep milk and she sells a wide variety of hard and soft cheeses. ""I'd love if people ate local produce all the time, not just during a pandemic,"" she says"

And a similar number say the main reason for the increase is due to lack of supply. These are among the key findings of a survey of over 200 estate agents from all over the country which also revealed a marked regional variation with regard to future price movements. While agents in Munster and Connacht/Ulster expect prices to increase by 7% over the next 12 months, the figure in Leinster is 6% while in Dublin, where prices are highest, it is 4%. In cash terms, a 7% increase on a (EURO)200,000 home outside of Dublin will equate to an increase of (EURO)14,000 while a 4% increase on a (EURO)400,000 home in Dublin will mean an increase of (EURO)16,000. Agents said the higher price forecast for properties outside Dublin reflected the covid effect and the increased attractiveness of regional properties due to the dramatic rise in people working from home. President of the SCSI, TJ Cronin, said: ""We had a supply crisis pre-Covid and that has simply deepened due to covid. While 45% of respondents in the survey reported a fall in selling instructions in Q2 2021, 81% reported an increase in enquiries. ""In addition, eight out of 10 agents are reporting low stock levels.

The move by the two groups, which advise institutional shareholders on transactions and governance issues, removes the last lingering uncertainty over whether CD&R's improved offer will be accepted at a shareholder meeting on July 22. The initial proposed deal for £10.23 ((EURO)11.95) per share in May, valuing the company at £2.6bn, was at first opposed by Allianz Global Investors, UDG's largest shareholder, and Kabouter Management, despite acceptance by the company's board. CD&R returned with a sweetened offer at the end of last month, bringing both investors on board. The two firms control more than 11pc of UDG. The takeover is being implemented via a Scheme of Arrangement, under which CD&R needs 75pc shareholder approval. This week several other major institutions, including Goldman Sachs, Rothschild, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan, confirmed their approval of the improved offer of £10.80, or £2.8bn. Elliott Management, the activist investor group which built a stake in UDG after CD&R's first tilt at the company, has not disclosed whether it will vote in favour of the sale. UDG said on Tuesday that it had not received offers from any other bidders since CD&R submitted its original bid. The stock has climbed nearly 40pc this year with much of that coming in the last two months. UDG shares closed at £10.74. The opposition to the initial offer reflects a wider concern that private equity companies are taking advantage of lower market valuations owing to Brexit and the pandemic to try and buy firms for less than they are worth. Allianz said the initial bid, which was announced on May 12, was ""opportunistic and significantly undervalues UDG and its prospects"". RBC Capital Markets said most major investors were ""modestly disappointed"" with the £10.23 per share bid with several expressing ""a strong view that it undervalues the company"". Some shareholders were in favour of even the lower bid, though, citing UDG's ""disappointing recent track record of deploying capital, historical transaction multiples, and the lack of other natural buyers for the company"", according to RBC. The pace of health-care acquisitions has accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, and UDG, which provides a range of services to pharmaceutical customers in about 25 countries, said last month it is supporting clients in bringing Covid-19 treatments and vaccines to market. The takeover would reunite former UDG chief executive Liam Fitzgerald with the company that he ran from 2000-2016. Now an operating advisor for CD&R on European healthcare, Mr Fitzgerald is chairman of Huntsworth, a provider of commercialisation services for pharmaceutical and biotech companies that CD&R bought last year and intends to merge with UDG's Ashfield division.

Ahead of a meeting with the Government today, the hospitality industry insist rules on table distances should be ditched in return for pub and restaurant owners supporting plans for a new vaccine ID system for indoor dining. Under the current Covid-19 restrictions, tables must be kept two metres apart if customers are staying longer than 105 minutes. At a meeting last week with Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, publicans said social distancing rules should be dropped if only vaccinated people are allowed in pubs. It is understood Mr Varadkar said he is open to the proposals. Yesterday, a Vintners' Federation of Ireland spokesperson said: ""The point made to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is that the presumption from our side is if you have to be vaccinated to get into a pub, then, ergo, social distancing doesn't come into play."" Restaurant Association of Ireland (RAI) chief executive Adrian Cummins echoed the calls of the Vintners' Federation. ""If they are bringing in the vaccine passes, then removing social distancing restrictions has to be on the table,"" Mr Cummins said. ""If social distancing is removed for hospitality businesses, it will generate an economic bonus for restaurants, pubs and cafes,"" he added. However, Mr Cummins insisted his main focus will be seeking a date for indoor dining resuming and a detailed outline for how vaccine passes will operate. The Vintners' Federation spokesperson said he expects the Government to put ""meat on the bones"" of what they are proposing. However, it remained unclear last night if the Government had developed any plan since it met the hospitality sector after the shock announcement that indoor dining could only return if IDs for vaccinated people are introduced. The news was a major blow for the industry, which has felt the full brunt of the pandemic with many businesses yet to reopen. One Cabinet minister said social distancing could be scrapped if only vaccinated customers were permitted in pubs or restaurants. ""We can only really do that if we don't allow PCR or antigen testing for indoor dining,"" the minister said. One senior government source played down the prospect of any detailed proposals being presented to the hospitality sector at today's meeting. ""This is the first meeting of the group, so it's about working with the sector to develop options,"" the source said. ""It's an opportunity to build on the constructive discussions of last week."" Mr Cummins was also critical of news that there are no plans to invite representatives from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to the meeting with the hospitality sector. He called on the Taoiseach and the Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to instruct Nphet officials to attend the meeting. ""Negotiations need swift and accurate decisions in order to restart the hospitality sector as soon as possible,"" he said on Twitter. Meanwhile, there is growing frustration in government over the introduction of the EU's Digital Covid Certificate for international travel. Minister of State Ossian Smyth, who is overseeing the introduction of the certificates, refused to respond to queries yesterday despite reports suggesting he was going to miss the July 19 date for introducing the scheme. Mr Smyth is already under pressure after European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders contradicted his claims that the HSE cyber attack would not delay the introduction of the certificates for international travel. Ireland is the only country in the EU that does not have the system already in place. A Green Party spokesperson said Mr Smyth is ""confident the system will be ready by July"". However, he could not guarantee the certificates will be ready in time. The Cabinet was warned last week it will be challenging to introduce the certificates for travel before the July 19 deadline. The Digital Covid Certificate will include a person's name, date of birth, vaccine ID and issue date. Once scanned, it will show whether a person has been vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19 in the last nine months, or received a negative PCR or antigen test result. Antigen tests will not be accepted as means of avoiding quarantine when travelling into Ireland.

Mr Putin (68) has been in power as president or prime minister since the turn of the century. His current six-year term in the Kremlin is due to end in 2024, and his remarks are being closely examined for clues as to whether he plans to extend his rule. Russia changed its constitution last year at Mr Putin's behest, allowing him to run for two more six-year terms in the Kremlin and potentially remain president until 2036. The Kremlin is at a delicate political juncture with its relations with the West badly strained and its oil-dependent economy emerging from the pandemic with high inflation and a weak Rouble, sensitive issues for voters. Russia holds parliamentary elections in September that are seen as a dry run for the 2024 presidential election. In the run-up, authorities have cracked down hard on the opposition and outlawed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's network as ""extremist"". ""A time will come when, I hope, I can say that such and such a person is worthy in my opinion of leading such a wonderful country like Russia, our homeland,"" Mr Putin said. The Russian leader was speaking during his annual questions and answers session on state TV that the Kremlin uses for political messaging and to show he is in touch with regular Russians' day-to-day concerns. ""A signal. There will be a successor,"" Alexei Chesnakov, a political analyst who used to work in the presidential administration, wrote on Telegram messenger. Mr Putin also claimed a US reconnaissance aircraft was operating in sync with a British destroyer during last week's Black Sea incident in what he described as a ""provocation"" to test Moscow. Russia said one of its warships fired warning shots and a warplane dropped bombs in the path of British destroyer HMS Defender on June 23 to force it out of an area near the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. Britain denied that account, insisted its ship was not fired on and said it was sailing in Ukrainian waters. Asked if the incident could have triggered World War III, Mr Putin said it was hardly possible, even if Russia had sunk the British warship, because Western powers knew they could not emerge as winners in a global conflict. Speaking during a live call-in show, Mr Putin said that the US aircraft's apparent mission was to monitor the Russian military's response to the British destroyer. He added that Moscow was aware of the US intentions and responded accordingly to avoid revealing sensitive data. In the incident, Britain insisted the Defender had been making a routine journey through an internationally recognised travel lane and remained in Ukrainian waters near Crimea. The UK, like most of the world, recognises Crimea as part of Ukraine despite the peninsula's 2014 annexation by Russia. Russia denounced the Defender's move as a provocation and warned that next time it could fire to hit intruding warships if they try to test Russian military resolve. Responding to a question about Russia's tug-of-war with Ukraine, Mr Putin emphasised his long-held claim of close kinship between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples, but accused the Ukrainian leadership of maintaining a hostile course toward Russia. He voiced hope that the country could avoid a nationwide lockdown amid a surge of new infections."

South Africa’s national rugby union team, the Springboks, won the World Cup back on Nov. 2, 2019. The Springboks’ first Black captain, Siya Kolisi, lifted the Webb Ellis trophy and the spirits of his nation, and there was widespread optimism that the most diverse South Africa rugby team ever to take the world’s top prize would do much to bring healing to an often divided nation. But the Springboks couldn’t get back on the field for 20 months. Still, South Africa has clung to its world No. 1 ranking despite the long pandemic layoff, though several contenders who have played tough matches might now claim they deserve the top spot. The rusty Springboks finally played a match on July 2, when they logged a comfortable 40-9 win over Georgia as they begin preparation in earnest for a major challenge this month when the British and Irish Lions squad visits for eight games against South African opposition, ending with three official test matches against the Springboks on July 24, July 31 and Aug. 7. Some preparation matches are up in the air, because of a coronavirus outbreak in the Springbok camp, including Jacques Nienaber, the new head coach, and flyhalf Handré Pollard. A second match against Georgia scheduled for this past Friday was canceled. The quadrennial Lions tour is world rugby’s biggest event between World Cup years and alternates among the three Southern Hemisphere powers with matches every 12 years in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The team is an all-star test squad of players from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Traveling fans from Britain and Ireland usually take up half or more of the stadiums, in what is often called the sea of red, but because of the pandemic, there will be no spectators this year. On the eve of the tour, Kolisi spoke with The New York Times about the Springboks, his background growing up poor in a township outside Port Elizabeth, and off-field activities he has been busy with since the World Cup. This conversation took place a few weeks before South Africa faced Georgia, and has been condensed and edited for clarity. After the long layoff, can the Springboks be prepared to take on the best of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland this summer? What’s your assessment of the Lions team Coach Warren Gatland has assembled? Yes, I definitely think so. We’re still working hard, so I think the team will be prepared and ready by the time the tests come. I think Gatland has picked a very physical team, kind of a big team to try to match the Springboks physically. It’s always been a tough series, so I think physically it’s going to be up there, some of the toughest games that we’ll ever have. How do you think not having spectators will affect the atmosphere and the overall feel of the event? I know the Lions tour usually does so much not just for the rugby but for the country itself, for the continent. People come in in numbers, they do tourism things, and for the economy it does so much. But you won’t see that sea of red in the stands from the traveling Lions fans. Still, for whoever is chosen to play, it’s going to be special. There’ll probably be a lot of stories saying it’s the first Lions tour without fans, but there’s enough opportunity for players to shine regardless, and at the end of the day when they write about this in the history books, they’re going to write the scores, not whether there were fans or not on that day, so we still have to make it work.  After you won the World Cup, you and other members of the team spoke eloquently about how you thought the victory would do a lot to bring the country together. How well do you think this has actually happened? You know we were confronted with the pandemic afterward. We saw how people were excited when they were watching us play in the World Cup, and how together they were for those moments. But I think we as players were able to do so much more to help during the pandemic. Like after the World Cup, with our foundations, with the work that we do to use our personal brands to help others who are in need during the pandemic. We were able to use some of our kit from the World Cup to raise some funds as the team, but also individually. More people wanted to work with us, and we were able to donate food, donate P.P.E. and do all those kinds of things with people for the good. That was a very important and a huge thing for us to see, that after people were backing us and supporting us during the whole World Cup, we were able to come when they needed us the most, we were able to come and do our part. After the death of George Floyd in the United States, there were Black Lives Matter protests worldwide. You spoke out and received criticism from some white South Africans who said “all lives matter.” I’ve listened to your eloquent explanation of why you decided to sign on to the Black Lives Matter movement but wonder if you think the message has gotten through. For me, that video was all about sharing my story. I can’t speak about everything, because I haven’t experienced everything like everybody else. All I’m concerned about is my own personal journey. All that I was basically saying is that my dream is for equality for everyone. Not just for me, or people that look like me. Everybody should have a fair playing field. And that’s my biggest fight. And some people don’t hear that. They don’t want to hear what I’m saying. They think I’m putting myself or my race above everybody else. All I’m saying is that let’s all play on the same playing field. That’s all I’m saying. Equality for everyone. That’s my message. It’s always been my message. Imagine how our society or how the world would be if kids woke up in different parts of the world and could dream and just want to be whatever they want to be, that it’s possible for them to wake up and dream to be a doctor, because they have been given the infrastructure around them, and they can see they have reference points — role models. We’ve made it, and they know, “OK, he’s done it, I can also believe I can be that.”  So tell me a bit about that personal journey. I’m saying that for me, I couldn’t dream. I couldn’t dream to be me right now, when I was young. But I had help. I was helped by my community, getting food every day. I didn’t have food every day, so my grandmother would go up to neighbors for a cup of mealie-meal and a cup of rice to just make me full. And sometimes I would go to bed just having sugar water. And that was just life. The mentality in the hood, or the township or the poor areas, is just survival: How do I get through today? So you must have quite a few stories to share about your upbringing in the township. I can tell you something. I’m releasing my book in September. I talk about my life in the book. A little about rugby and everything else. Because someone wrote a book about me without my permission. So I’m doing my own book. It’s called “Rise.” It’s from my Mom’s name. In Xhosa her name was Phakama, and that means “rise.” Your wife, Rachel, is from South Africa’s white community. Do you think this has helped break down any of the resistance to your position from that community? She knows me, she knows my story and she loves every single part of me. And she knows me more than anybody else knows me, and she also wants change. She also just wants fairness. That’s all what we’re about. We have two kids, and my two young siblings live with us, and my siblings look like me. And it’s not even about them, because they’re fine, they go to all the great schools; I look after them. But it’s all of their mates that they’ve left behind that nobody’s fighting for. So Rachel and I believe a lot of the same things, and we fight for the same causes. We are fighting for equality for everyone.  You and your wife have a foundation whose mission is to “change narratives of inequality.” What do you mean by this, and of the kinds of projects the foundation is doing, do you have a favorite? What I mean by that is basically what I’ve been saying the whole time. The way I grew up, kids shouldn’t have to grow up like that. And yet there are people who experience far worse childhoods than I have. But I don’t think that’s fair. You know I got a bursary [scholarship] when I was 12 years old to go to a suburb school because of sports. And when I got there, I just looked at the building, and I said, “Wow, I can be whatever I want to be in this life.” Just from looking at the infrastructure. And I thought, my friends need this. The township needs this; the hood needs this. Because if a building can change my mind-set, that’s what I’m talking about. That’s what we want. That’s what we’re fighting for. We just want to have those opportunities. My favorite project? Well, the sports things we do are obviously good, but the most important to me is the gender-based violence, where we get all men in the township talking about gender-based violence. I grew up around a community where gender-based violence was such a normal thing. Seeing a man lift his hand to a woman had become so normal that you wouldn’t even turn to look when you hear a woman scream. So I want to encourage more men to speak more about it. I want to get more men sharing their stories and asking questions.  Do you see yourself as a role model to South African youth? No, I do not see myself like that, but some do see me like that. But I do see myself as a role model to my daughter and my son and my young brother and sister. And that’s who I want to inspire every single day because I believe if I can set a great example for them, it will obviously lead to others outside, but that’s the first and foremost people that I want to make sure that I inspire and that I live a life that I want them to be proud of. I want them to look at me and say you know what, I want to be like my dad. I try to keep it small, but I don’t try to focus on the rest of South Africa.

The Central Bank examination also found that there has been an almost 30 per cent drop in stockbroking and other trading firms reporting suspicious trades since 2018, even though trading volumes have increased over the period. The regulator said that this ""may indicate a failure by firms to keep their processes up to date with the volume of their trading activity"". Meanwhile, the bank also concluded that advisory firms to publicly quoted companies and market-listed debt often have an ""informal approach"" to defining inside information and how to safeguard this.  It also found that firms sometimes allowed staff in on market-sensitive information that they do not need to access.  Market Abuse Regulation (MAR), which was brought into force across the European Union to replace mostly national rules, requires that companies that issue shares or other market-listed financial instruments make potentially market-moving inside information public as soon as possible. The aim of the rules are to prevent insider trading, unlawful disclosure of information and market manipulation in increasingly sophisticated financial markets.  Biggest review The Central Bank has completed its biggest review into market-abuse risks by writing Dear CEO letters to market issuers, trading companies and advisory companies highlighting common issues and reminding them of their responsibilities.  While supervisors observed some good practices, the bank has also imposed specific risk-mitigation programmes on firms where it found issues.  A spokesman for the Central Bank declined to comment on whether anything emerged from the review that has triggered, or may lead to, enforcement investigations, or required it to file reports with An Garda Síochána. The Central Bank examination found instances of information gaps on insider lists that were completed among 22 Euronext Dublin companies surveyed, including a rationale as to why certain people had access to information that could move a share price.  Only two of the Euronext Dublin main market companies could prove they took all reasonable steps to ensure insiders were aware of, and acknowledged, their duties. Potential sanctions for market abuse range from Central Bank directions and restrictions to fines of up to EUR 10 million or 10 years in prison in cases of criminal conviction. ""Misconduct on securities markets undermines transparency and trust among market participants and is detrimental to investor protection. MAR is a critical component in deterring misconduct and identifying market abuse where it occurs,"" said Derville Rowland, director of financial conduct at the Central Bank.  'Market activity' ""As the scale of securities market activity carried on in and from Ireland increases, so too does the obligation of market participants to ensure their organisational arrangements to identify, mitigate  and manage market-abuse risk are effective; having regard to the nature, scale and complexity of their operations."" Ms Rowland added: ""The findings published today show a need to raise standards and embed cultures that identify, mitigate and manage market-abuse risk more effectively."""

Relegation to Division Four just four weeks ago is still fresh in their minds as they face opposition they haven't beaten in the Championship since way back in 1983. The shock loss to Wicklow which sealed their relegation last month was a significant dent to the county's pride, particularly when their stock had been so high after last year's Ulster Championship success. ""It was more hurt rather than a shellshock, because we had given Wicklow the respect we would give every other team,"" said Galligan. ""We had done our work on Wicklow, but it was just very disappointing because there is a lot of hurt from dropping down the Leagues. ""But we can't dwell on it and we really do have to utilise our time as best we can and once we went back training we had to really look forward rather than behind us because there were lots of positives from the game. ""We created many attacks and it's just unfortunate that we didn't score enough to win the game. ""It's a harsh lesson for every one of us, and it's given us the appetite to question ourselves but work that bit harder over the next few weeks so that those lapses throughout the field don't happen again."" Galligan is in bullish mood as they set about defending their provincial title today. He says: ""Once we cross that white line in Healy Park, the League will quickly go out the window. ""We feel we definitely have a chance, we know it will be difficult, but the League will have very little impact when we arrive in Healy Park."" While that's pretty much what you'd expect the team captain to say in the circumstances, Cavan do have previous in this respect. They were arguably in a tighter corner after a madcap finish to last year's League saw them enter the last day with a chance of promotion only to end up being relegated after losing at home to Roscommon as Laois went on a late goal spree against Fermanagh. A week later, they saw off Monaghan - with Galligan kicking the winning point at the death to avoid a penalty shootout - and were beating a path towards a first Ulster title in 23 years. ""No different than last year, we will really be based on how the Championship goes, in our view. And preparing for Tyrone is now all we can look forward to. ""We have to park what has happened in the League and we'll go back to that next winter. ""It was disappointing, but we really have to draw the line and look towards Tyrone. It's a huge game and a very difficult challenge."" While their record against Tyrone may not be a source of encouragement, Galligan points to how they managed to turn their Ulster final beating from Donegal in 2019 - which was more comprehen- s i v e than the five-point margin suggested - on its head against them in last year's provincial decider. ""We knew when the draw was done it was going to be a very difficult opponent, and we're under no illusions that it's going to take a massive performance to get the result. ""The one thing we did last year, we stopped looking behind us, because I think it's a habit that a lot of teams can do, and think too much about the past. ""When we played Donegal in the Ulster final, the talk was about the beating we had got the year previous. ""So that's one thing we've learned, is that it's all about the present moment, and what has gone on before will have very little relevance come game time.

The Ulster Bank Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remained well above the no-change mark of 50 in June, registering a 65.0 after an even stronger result of 66.4 in May, indicating strong expansion in the sector. ""Building on the post-lockdown bounce recorded in May, the June results of the Ulster Bank Construction PMI signal that Irish construction activity experienced another month of very rapid growth last month,"" said Ulster Bank chief economist Simon Barry. ""The headline PMI was at one of the highest levels in the survey's history for the second consecutive month, albeit down marginally from May."" Housing construction led the snap-back with a strong increase in activity of 68.8, followed closely by commercial building at 63.8. Civil engineering activity grew less robustly at 57.7, but still well ahead of standstill. Employment in the building sector and purchasing grew for the third month in a row as customer demand and new activity drove continued expansion. Ulster Bank said companies were optimistic activity would continue to rise over the coming year as the economy reopened further, although many expressed concern about rising input costs and inflation in the prices for materials due to the pandemic and Brexit supply chain disruptions. ""While the signals of ongoing strength in activity are certainly encouraging, the rate of input cost inflation accelerated to a second consecutive record high as the June survey results highlight that the sector continues to face important supply-chain and cost challenges related to Brexit, Covid and global supply and shipping problems,"" said Mr Barry. Meanwhile appetite for residential property pushed up Irish land sales in the first half of the year by 15pc versus 2020 to (EURO)193m, according to data from Savills Ireland. Turnover in the first six months of last year reached (EURO)167m. Residentially zoned land sales accounted for more than 75pc of the 2021 total, suggesting developers are focusing on the tight housing market for opportunities. ""With strong activity in the residential market in the first half of 2021, it is unsurprising that the majority of the land sold had residential related zoning,"" said John Swarbrigg, director of development land at Savills Ireland. ""Indeed, it is likely that the strong growth in house prices helped to drive demand for residentially zoned land."" Savills said sites with full planning permission were trading at a greater premium than in the past as one-third of permissions under the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) process were going to judicial review. Mr Swarbrigg welcomed steps being taken by the Government to reform the SHD system, but said in the meantime financiers and developers were unwilling to take on planning risks. He also said requirements to build at high density, even in areas outside Dublin and other cities, was holding back development in non-urban areas and contributing to the supply imbalances in the country.

Too many of them advertised on supermarket noticeboards, rarely issued a rent book, were impossible to contact when the boiler burst and had little awareness of the legal rights of tenants or responsibilities of lessors. If only the sector could have become more professional. Well, now the professionals are in town and there are new problems to contend with. Build-to-rent (BTR) as a model of housing is a relatively new concept in Ireland. It is a housing model that has worked quite well in other nations where tenants get good-quality, professionally maintained accommodation at reasonable rents with security of tenure, while investors get a return that is modest compared with potential stock market gains but infinitely more secure, steady and longterm. With home building sluggish, demand increasing and rents soaring, the Government decided BTR should be encouraged here. International investors had access to funds that domestic builders were struggling to unlock, so it seemed to make sense to invite them in and get building under way. Not only were they offered the sweetener of fast-track planning through the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) arrangement for developments of more than 100 units, but new, downgraded apartment design standards were introduced specifically for them in 2018. BTR apartments could be smaller and have fewer windows than their build-to-sell counterparts with fewer individual amenities. The logic, apparently, is that this would get them built quicker and more cheaply, and as they weren't going to be forever homes, renters wouldn't mind putting up with a lower spec temporarily. Such an approach acts on the presumption that renting would be temporary, but the very fact that many new developments are BTR means there are fewer homes available to buy. Rents, meanwhile, have stayed sky-high, as have property prices generally, so saving for a deposit to buy has become impossible for many. That is not necessarily an inherent flaw in the BTR model, but some of its better attributes seem to have become lost in translation to the Irish market. One letting agent targeting BTR clients has a website meant for use by both renters and investors. Yet the blurb boasts of achieving record rents in some areas. Framing it like this does little for BTR's image problem. It also terrifies those who can't see themselves ever having a home that isn't rented, and wonder what will happen when they get older and can no longer afford to be part of the private rental industry's record-breaking attempts. BTR does not yet dominate the housing market. Figures correct up to May 21 show planning permission has been granted for just over 49,000 units under the SHD arrangements, not including co-living and student units. Of those, 12,991 are houses, 27,816 are conventional apartments and 8,729 are BTR. A small number of housing developments have also been built on the BTR model. But planning decisions are due on more than 1,600 BTR apartments in the next few months, and undoubtedly new applications will be submitted before the ending of the SHD arrangements which are scheduled to finish next February. The ending of SHD is unlikely to deter BTR as the 'fast-track' process hasn't always been very speedy anyway. Apartments are also excluded from the Government's promised new restrictions on investment funds buying up housing estates. So it seems likely BTR will hold an increasing share of the country's housing stock in the years to come, particularly in our cities. That could work fine, so long as an effective system of rent controls is devised and enforced, and thought is put into how life-long renters are to be provided for once their salaries plummet to pension levels. It is ironic that at a time when cities are apparently being reimagined as post- Covid places of community, amenity and space, much of the housing to be provided may allow only for temporary, transient and stressful residency. It doesn't sit well with the Government's stated policy of putting home ownership first either. One of the small but depressing aspects of the long months of lockdown was hearing tenants of large apartment complexes being told off by management companies for allowing their children play in the few open spaces. If BTR is to be a fixture here, some ground rules must apply, and everyday reminders to renters that 'it's not your home, it's our investment' cannot be tolerated.

Rent controls were introduced in December 2016 to temper an overheating rental market. The controls mean that landlords of properties in so-called rent pressure zones - which includes all of Dublin and much of the rest of the country - cannot increase rents by more than 4 per cent a year. However, in a statement yesterday, the Department of Housing said the caps will be replaced with caps in line with inflation only. Annual increases  ""The current cap of 4 per cent on annual rent increases will be replaced and rents in RPZs can now only go up, if necessary, in line with general inflation as recorded in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP),"" it said. ""This will result in far lower rent increases for the estimated 74 per cent of all tenancies which are in RPZs. HICP averaged 0.73 per cent over the past three years."" The department added that for those outside of RPZs, the provision for biannual rent reviews will be extended for an additional three years from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2024. ""This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum two year period at a time,"" it said. Upfront payments Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien said the 4 per cent cap on rent increases in RPZs had become ""a target rather than a limit"" for landlords. ""We are now taking action to ensure that tenants will only pay rent increases, if required to, which are in line with general inflation, which is currently below 2 per cent,"" he said. Mr O'Brien said the Bill will also restrict the level of upfront payments required of tenants, to a total value that does not exceed two months' rent to cover any deposit and one month rent in advance. ""We are also extending protections for those most impacted by Covid-19, in arrears and at risk of losing their tenancy,"" he said.

The higher costs are feeding through to consumers as well as businesses absorbing them in the form of reduced margins, the data shows. The overall picture for the sector is good. The purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector in June showed a continuing steep rebound as lockdown restrictions eased. Services - everything from banking and software to bars and hotels - is the biggest single sector of the economy. The PMI tracks health of the private sector through monthly surveys of managers. This is translated into a gauge, where numbers over 50 show growth. Under 50 indicates decline. Services in June rose to 63.1 from 62.1 in May, indicating robust growth across all major headline areas including total activity, new work and outstanding business. The employment indicator rose at the fastest pace since September 2017. However, the June data showed rising input costs are intensifying inflationary pressures. The costs of fuel, wages, insurance, utilities, freight and Brexit-related costs were all reported to have risen during the month, with input costs rising in June at the highest rate since July 2008. At least some of that is being passed on, with customer prices rising at the fastest rate since November 2018. AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan said the June data signalled surging demand in the Irish economy, with new business increasing at its fastest pace in five years. However, he noted that growth in new export businesses, which have tended to be a key economic driver, is not nearly as strong as domestically led growth. Mr Mangan said exports had been held back, in part, by a continuing contraction in tourism business from overseas, an ongoing effect of Covid-related restrictions. Inflation has re-emerged as an economic factor. This is, in part, because reopening economies have struggled to match supply chains to unpredictable demand. While policy makers have tended to be relaxed at what many believe is a temporary inflationary effect, the head of the Dutch central bank, Klaas Knot, warned yesterday that rising costs could become a more significant issue. ""Inflation is not dead,"" said Mr Knot said in an interview with NRC Handelsblad. ""We should not over-estimate our ability to determine what is temporary inflation and what is not.""

The project has been led by IT Sligo creative design lecturer David Roberts who believes the ventilator could make the difference between life and death in developing countries where medics are struggling to cope with a surge in Covid-19 cases. The team has released the design plan online ""in an effort to save lives"" and according to Mr Roberts no software, or electronic expertise, is needed.  He said a key component of the ventilator is the motor from a car windscreen wiper, while the power supply comes from defunct personal computers.  He and colleagues have also designed a helmet-like Covid mask sourcing material from a local boat-cover manufacturer and pipes from Sligo County Council, as well as using material from recycled wetsuits. The lecturer was inspired by a story he read some years ago about a young Chinese man who was paralysed from the neck down after a motorcycle accident, whose family kept him alive for five years by squeezing a ventilator by hand hundreds of times a day. The lecturer said when he read last year that anyone over 60 in Italy would not get a ventilator, it had focused his mind. ""I am over 60 and if I needed a ventilator I would be happy to use my own,"" said the engineer. While the Italian authorities subsequently denied that only people under 60 were being intubated, the IT Sligo researchers, who liaised with engineers in Clare and Limerick, were aware of the ethical dilemmas being faced by doctors worldwide because of the pandemic. The team, who consulted medics from Sligo University Hospital and University Hospital Limerick, manufactured 10 mechanical ventilators, which they intended to make available to Irish hospitals in the event of emergencies, but the feared shortage of equipment did not materialise. ""Everyone thought in the early stages that ventilators would be in short supply but, for example, the first wave did not hit Sligo hospital badly,"" said Mr Roberts. Easily available  A key aspect of the project was that the materials needed were easily available anywhere in the world, with no requirement for 3D printing technology or software, he said.  ""I grew up in the Far East and Africa and I have some idea of life on the ground in tropical countries and how needs must,"" said the lecturer. He said he was aware of a recent Covid-19 surge in Indonesia, for example, and feared there would be other countries with limited access to technology who might find their design useful. His colleague Dr Gerard McGranaghan, a member of Engineers Without Borders, who served as a United Nations volunteer in Nepal, also worked on the project.

The Revenue plans to revise its online guide before homeowners are asked to submit a new valuation this November, in what will be the first revision to valuations since the LPT was introduced in 2013. However, speaking at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Richard O'Donoghue, Independent TD for Limerick County, said it was impossible for homeowners to ""get a proper valuation"" at the moment amid sharp inflation in some selling prices.

""In normal times, I think it is fair to say that the value of the properties that are being bought and sold on the market are probably a reasonable indicator of the overall stock of properties in the country.

Sinn Féin TD for Dublin Bay North, Denise Mitchell, welcomed the temporary LPT exemption announced last month - as part of the Department of Finance's overall reform of the tax - for homeowners whose homes have been damaged by defective pyrite and mica blocks in Donegal and Mayo. Ms Mitchell asked a representative of the Department of Finance if apartment blocks with fire safety issues and other structural problems might also be exempted. ""Our starting point is always that the number of exemptions would be kept as limited as possible to make it fair for those who are paying the tax.

The name was given by, and coincided with, the rule of President Mobutu Sese Seko. The Zairian space programme originated with a West German company called Orbital Transport und Raketetn Aktiengesellschaft Inc (OTRAG). Founded in 1975 in Stuttgart by German aerospace engineer Lutz Kayser, OTRAG was a serious attempt to develop a low-cost satellite launcher using clusters of mass-produced rockets. By the mid-1970s, Kayser's technology required a suitable launch site. He could not do this in Germany because of the amended 1954 Treaty of Brussels, which prohibited the launching of long-range or guided missiles from German soil. In 1975, OTRAG made a controversial agreement with the notoriously corrupt President Mobutu Sese Seko, who envisaged the programme as a prestigeboosting scheme for himself, to establish 'the private Cape Canaveral of Africa'. The deal saw OTRAG secure a 25-year lease of 38,000 square miles of land in Shaba Province (now Katanga). A launch pad and gantry were erected, and flight tests began in 1977. OTRAG-1, consisting of four propulsion modules, a nose cone and four fins, was launched from Zaire on May 18, 1977, with Mobutu present for the launch. It achieved an altitude of 19 kilometres before the four engines broke off and OTRAG-1 crashed back to Earth. Kayser's activities made the great powers nervous. The USSR and France did not want Germany achieving long-range rocket capability and the US was against having a low-cost competitor. It was alleged that OTRAG was a cover for German and South African nuclear cruise missile development. Under pressure from the USSR, Mobutu withdrew permission to use the site in April 1979. Soviet president Brezhnev and French president Giscard d'Estaing applied further pressure and, after a total investment of £75million, OTRAG was forced to leave Germany. OTRAG relocated to a new assembly and launch site in a remote area of the Sahara Desert, in Libya. In 1983 the Libyan government confiscated all OTRAG's rocket manufacturing and test equipment in the country. After spending about £100million, OTRAG was shut down in 1987.

Compiled by James Black WHILE it may taste like medicine to some, Worcestershire sauce was never sold as a medicine. Another condiment, tomato ketchup, was. According to official Lea & Perrins history, Worcestershire sauce was created by accident. In 1835, John Lea and William Perrins were asked to recreate a fish sauce that a local nobleman, cited as Lord Marcus Sandys (although this is disputed), had enjoyed in India. The fish and vegetable mixture had such a strong odour that it was stored in the cellar. It lay forgotten for two years until it was rediscovered during a spring clean. The batch had aged into a piquant sauce which was bottled and quickly became a cupboard staple. The history of ketchup in the Western world extends back to the 16th century, when British sailors were introduced to a sauce that the Chinese called ke-tchup - this originally meant 'fish sauce' in a dialect of Fujian province. It wasn't until the 19th century that people began to add tomato to ketchups - the earliest known being Tomata Catsup (1817), which was a British recipe of tomatoes with anchovy sauce. In 1834, Ohio physician Dr John Cook Bennett declared tomatoes to be a universal panacea that could be used to treat diarrhoea, violent bilious attacks and indigestion. Bennett sold a tomato ketchup as a medicine; he also produced a version concentrated into pill form that he sold as a patent medicine. He may have had a point: tomatoes are the major dietary source of the anti-oxidant lycopene, which has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer. But, unlike Dr Bennett's formula, modern processed ketchups include large amounts of refined sugar and preservatives which negate many of its benefits. Glenn Barry, Cardiff. QUESTION Where is the longest hiking trail? ACCORDING to the Guinness Book Of Records, the world's longest designated hiking trail is the Pacific Crest Trail. The PCT stretches 4,265 kilometres from Mexico to Canada, travelling the length of California, Oregon and Washington. This trail is graded for both hikers and horses so, to the purist, the 3,524-kilometre hike-only Appalachian Trail (AT) might be considered the longest. It begins at Springer Mountain in Georgia in the American south and finishes at Mount Katahdin in Maine in the north, crossing 14 states. The two trails provide a very different experience. AT is characterised by thick deciduous forests in the south, and runs through the rocky terrain of Pennsylvania and into the alpine mountains of New England. Bears can be a nuisance. Much of the PCT is through desert and is harder logistically than the AT, which has a regular water supply. Along the PCT, water is scarce and hikers must carry it for long distances. Instead of bears, snakes, scorpions and myriad biting bugs make a lively distraction. There are several trails that purport to be even longer but these are really several connected existing trails.

The jobs represent a huge increase of nearly 40% on the budget airline's crew of just over 5,000 pilots. The recruits are being taken on over the next three years to man Ryanair's new fleet of Boeing 737-8200 Gamechanger planes, which are starting to arrive from Seattle in the US, where they are built. Travel industry expert Eoghan Corry said of the news: 'They're back in growth mode, it's a huge number of pilots. Ryanair making a statement like that is rattling their opposition as well.' Ryanair's people director Darrell Hughes said: 'As we take delivery of more than 210 Boeing 737-8200 Gamechanger aircraft, Ryanair will recruit 2,000+ pilots over the next three years to fill positions created by this growth.

'Throughout the pandemic, Ryanair has worked closely with our people to save jobs and we are delighted to start planning for a return to growth over the coming years.' Ryanair was initially due to take delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX two years ago. The airline said the new jets will help Ryanair lower costs, cut fuel consumption and also reduce its noise and CO2 emissions. The airline is the largest European customer for the jet, which was grounded for 20 months after two fatal crashes, with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat MAX200 model. Many of the new posts will be to fill vacancies created as current pilots are promoted to captain. A spokesman added: 'The new aircraft deliveries will be filled by internal promotions which creates opportunities for replacement first officers, and ultimately new cadet pilots who can kick-start their pilot career with Ryanair.'

The Irish airline group recently received the first of 210 Boeing 737 Max 8200 aircraft that it is buying from the US manufacturer. Yesterday the group announced a recruitment drive to hire 2,000 new pilots as it takes delivery of the jets and rebuilds from the Covid-19 crisis over the next three years. Ryanair stressed that all would be new jobs. The airline will promote captains for the new craft from within its ranks, making way for 2,000 new first officer and cadet recruits. Darrell Hughes, Ryanair's people director, said that the airline's own pilots would enjoy ""fast-tracked promotion"" as the carrier took on the new aircraft. Ryanair will begin training this year to ensure pilots will be ready take up posts across Europe in summer 2022. The company is joining forces with Airline Flight Academy in Dublin to provide the training courses. Ryanair said its pilots work five days on-four days off rosters while they get ""world class"" training.  'Return to growth' ""Throughout the pandemic, Ryanair has worked closely with our people to save jobs and we are delighted to start planning for a return to growth over the coming years as we recover from the Covid-19 crisis and grow to 200 million guests by full year 2024,"" said Mr Hughes. The airline received the first of the new Boeing jets last month, with several more arriving during the intervening weeks. The Irish group was originally meant to begin receiving the Boeing aircraft in 2019, but safety regulators grounded the Max in March of that year following fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Malaysia. European and US authorities have since certified the aircraft as safe following more than a year of work where Boeing addressed problems highlighted by the 2019 crashes. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted its ban on the aircraft in January. In December, Ryanair Holdings chief executive Michael O'Leary described the Max as the ""most scrutinised and audited aircraft"" in aviation history. However, Ryanair endured further delays in deliveries this year, prompting Mr O'Leary to criticise Boeing several times. New aircraft  Yesterday the airline said the new aircraft would help Ryanair cut costs, fuel consumption, noise and carbon emissions. The group maintained that the investment deepened its commitment to being Europe's ""cleanest and greenest"" major airline. Ryanair's total order for 210 Max aircraft is valued at $22 billion (EUR 18.5 billion) at list prices, but the Irish carrier is likely to have secured a discount on this. It has also received further concessions from the US manufacturer for the delays in the delivery of the aircraft, which stretch back for two years. The airline last month flew 5.8 million people as it stepped up capacity to cash in on increased demand for flights, sparked by European countries easing pandemic travel curbs. Mr O'Leary said last week that Ryanair hoped to fly more than eight million people this month as the recovery continued. He recently told industry analysts the airline hoped to recover to 90 per cent of pre-Covid traffic through next summer. "

It said it will hire 2,000 pilots for new Boeing 737 Max jets joining its fleet over the next three years. Deliveries began just recently. Ryanair was always going to need to hire crews for the jets, but it's still a vote of confidence in the future, and especially at a time when Europe's airlines have been hammered by the fallout from Covid. Last December, Ryanair ordered an additional 75 Max 737-8 200 jets, bringing the Irish carrier's total orderbook for Max aircraft to 210. They're worth more than $22bn ((EURO)18.5bn) at list prices. The Max has been dubbed a ""game changer"" by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary. It has eight more seats than the current Boeing 737-800 that's used in Ryanair's main fleet, which comprises about 450 aircraft. Those extra seats - without having additional staff - boost the profitability of the Max. So too does its lower fuel burn. That's especially attractive at a time when jet fuel costs are rising and many carriers have been left exposed to those higher prices having seen previous hedging positions unwind at a huge cost to them. According to the International Air Transport Association, jet fuel prices are, unsurprisingly, 80pc higher now than they were this time last year, but still up 4pc compared with last month as a broader economic recovery takes hold. With thousands of airline pilots having lost jobs and put under huge financial pressure, Ryanair is in a buyer's market as it looks to swell its ranks. At the end of March 2020 - just a few weeks after the pandemic struck - Ryanair employed 5,584 pilots. That was up from 5,446 a year earlier. It also had 9,725 cabin crew members, compared with 9,095 a year earlier. But as the Covid crisis dragged on and air travel remained grounded, the airline industry was left traumatised. Ryanair says it minimised job losses because of pay cuts and government job support schemes, ""while at the same time keeping our pilots, cabin crew and aircraft current and ready to resume service once normality returns"". While normality hasn't returned yet, it's slowly getting there. Still, the general industry consensus is that global passenger numbers won't return to 2019 levels until about 2024. However, with significant pent-up demand and bulging bank balances in many economies, it will be interesting to see if the numbers pick up sooner than expected. Demand is initially being driven by the leisure sector, rather than lucrative business travellers, however. Ryanair partner Airline Flight Academy is holding training courses this year for pilots to convert to the carrier's Max jets. Training is taking place at a new multi-million euro simulator training facility near Dublin Airport built and owned by Ryanair.

Salon business expert Liz McKeon is the Ireland and UK ambassador for an antidomestic violence training course for salons, Shear Haven. ""Over time you build up quite a relationship with your clients, and you know you're there as a go-to resource for them,"" said Ms McKeon, who worked as a therapist for years before turning to business development. She said she had seen the signs of domestic abuse in clients, such as clumps of missing hair or a partner patrolling outside the salon. ""There were occasions when you had a client in front of you, and you just knew, but you felt so useless, you didn't know what to say or do. ""There's a real need for people working in salons to use the wonderful relationship that we have with clients to provide greater support for people,"" she added. She also understands the importance of initiatives such as Shear Haven, because she is herself a survivor of domestic abuse. ""I've had the experience of literally having to run for my life and go into hiding. I just thought I have a responsibility to step up. ""I know what it's like to be in that position, and we all know domestic violence has seriously increased during the lockdowns. I just felt, here's a resource that would be really helpful to bring to Ireland and the UK,"" she said. The domestic violence education programme equips stylists with the knowledge and resources to recognise the signs of domestic violence, successfully navigate conversations with clients who may be in danger, and pass along tools that can help them get to safety. The training consists of a 20-minute online session followed by a short quiz. After completion, each participant gets a certificate of achievement. ""It's only 20 minutes long and might just help to save a life,"" said Ms McKeon. Gardaí got more than 43,000 calls last year to respond to domestic abuse incidents - a 16pc increase on 2019. The number of criminal charges brought for alleged crimes related to domestic abuse rose by 24pc to 7,600. The training was first developed by Susanne Post, a Nashville-based salon owner and survivor of domestic violence. A few months into the pandemic, Barbicide - a salon liquid cleaner firm - teamed up with Susanne and the YWCA to offer the Shear Haven training online. To date, more than 25,000 beauty professionals from around the world have completed the training. The training has now become mandatory for salon owners in Tennessee and Ms McKeon's ultimate goal is that the training will also become mandatory across Ireland and the UK. ""If it's compulsory in one part of world, it could be compulsory here. There's a lot more than 25,000 professionals out there,"" she said.

But one woman felt she had to stop to help -and swiftly realised that Matthew was having a stroke. She called 999. Now, Matthew, a 47-year-old father of two, is making a good recovery. As has been widely reported, his wife Georgina, 44, set about tracking down the Good Samaritan online, to thank her personally for what she did for Matthew that day last month - and the two are now in touch. Such a scenario is not as uncommon as it may sound. We spoke to three people who nearly died - and the strangers who saved them - about their dramatic rescues and the bonds that have since formed between them. PASSING MOTORISTS RESTARTED MY HEART LYNDA DONALDSON, 61, suffered a cardiac arrest outside the fish and chip shop she owned with her husband Graham, 54, in Saintfield, Co Down. Michelle McAvoy, 50, a school nurse from Bangor, came to the rescue, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Michelle lives with her husband, Michael, 52, a civil servant. LYNDA SAYS: I remember suddenly feeling dizzy and seeing black, then I was out cold on the floor. I'd had a cardiac arrest. Graham shouted for a passer-by to call 999. I awoke looking up into the face of a stranger who I now know was Michelle. I wasn't sure what had happened but heard people discussing CPR and ambulances, and remember thinking: 'That doesn't sound good.' Apparently, Michelle was driving past, saw what happened, jumped out of her car and began performing CPR. It took the ambulance 12 minutes to arrive and Michelle did CPR for more than five minutes to keep the blood pumping around my body. Without that, I might not have survived. A first-aid instructor, Phil Batt, also happened to be passing in his car with a defibrillator, which he used to shock my heart into starting working again. Later, in hospital, the consultant kept saying: 'You don't know how lucky you are.' Tests showed that the most likely reason for my cardiac arrest was an irregular heart rhythm with no obvious cause. I had an operation to place a defibrillating device in my chest, to start my heart should it stop again. Fortunately, Graham had taken Michelle's number, so a few weeks after this all happened - in January 2011- I met up with her for a coffee. We both cried and seemed to bond instantly. The experience changed my life. Graham and I trained as CPR instructors and set up a commercial first-aid training company. Michelle and I meet several times a year. If it hadn't been for her, I wouldn't be here. She's my guardian angel and a wonderful friend. MICHELLE SAYS: Lynda's skin was purple and her mouth was open like a stranded goldfish gasping when I saw her lying on the pavement with a very distressed man beside her. I hadn't performed CPR on someone in cardiac arrest since I was a student nurse 20 years earlier ? but instinct kicked in. By a stroke of luck, another passing motorist happened to have a defibrillator with him. He set up the machine, which delivers an electric charge to the heart to shock it and start a normal rhythm, while I continued CPR. By the time the ambulance arrived, Lynda was breathing again. I was so relieved when Graham phoned to say she was going to be all right.

Ken shared that he'd had dark days, too ? his wife had died after several years of breast cancer. I think the compassion he showed me just made me reconnect with life. Eventually, Ken coaxed me into taking tiny steps towards the side of the bridge. He was constantly gripping my coat tight. When I reached the side, I agreed to step back over the safety barrier. We hugged; Ken told me I'd be OK now and I was taken to hospital. That night proved to be a turning point in my life, mainly because I have since been diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and autism, both of which I believe were behind my previous mental health and educational difficulties, and I have been prescribed the drug Ritalin, which helps me to focus and stay calm. Last October I appealed on Facebook for Ken to get i n t o u c h so I could thank him. The message was shared thousands of times ? and hours later, he messaged me. We have texted regularly since. He put his own life at risk in saving me; and I will never forget that. KEN SAYS: When I spotted Reya high up on the bridge outside the safety barrier as me and my girlfriend Sue drove past, I knew I had to try to save her. While Sue called 999, I raced across to Reya and seconds later I was holding on to her coat. I was terrified she was going to jump. Reya's face was blank and emotionless, and she seemed wary. I told her: 'I've got you now and if you jump, we are both going over together.' I told her about losing my wife, Marita, to breast cancer five years before. We had been together for 25 years and losing her was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, but slowly I found a way to carry on. As Reya and I talked, we quickly built empathy and I could see expression coming back into her eyes. But my hands were getting numb with cold ? the effort of gripping her was so intense, I worried I might let go by accident. Gradually I coaxed her to the side of the bridge and, one hour and 25 minutes after I'd stopped to help, Reya finally stepped over the barrier to safety. I felt elated. But the next day I started shaking and couldn't stop for three days. I kept reliving the scene. I didn't know what had happened to her, so it was lovely to hear from her a few months later. Meeting Reya and her mum to have the picture taken for this article was just incredible ? I had tears in my eyes when I saw Reya (but I told her it was hay fever).

He is a widower and has a son and three stepsons. He was saved by Aneurin Metcalfe, 23, who works for a building supplies company iand lives with his partner Lauren, 18, a nursery nurse. BOBBY SAYS: I felt dizzy when I was out walking, so I crossed the road to rest on a bench. The next thing I can remember is waking up in intensive care. I was later told that Aneurin found me slumped in a flowerpot and gave me CPR while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. This was during the Covid pandemic, when most people were worried about getting infected. I don't think many other people would have stepped in to help ? but Aneurin did. Doctors found I'd had a cardiac arrest. I was overwhelmed to learn I'd been saved by a stranger. My sister Mary posted a message on a local Facebook group and Aneurin's friends saw it. When we spoke on the phone I was very emotional, almost lost for words. I still get choked up thinking about what he did for me. ANEURIN SAYS: Six people had gathered around Bobby outside the supermarket. Bystanders were filming him on their mobile phones ? I think some of them thought he was drunk. But I could see he wasn't breathing and his skin was grey. Someone shouted that an ambulance was coming but I felt it would be too late. Something just kicked in and I moved through the crowd and began chest compressions. I'd attended a weekend first-aid course when I was a 15-year-old Sea Cadet and although I'd learnt CPR, I had never had to use it. When I started the compressions, I felt his ribs crack. Some bystanders heckled me but I knew I had to keep going for what felt like the longest ten minutes of my life, until the ambulance came. It wasn't until friends saw a Facebook post from Bobby's sister that I knew he'd made it. I felt such relief ? it's the biggest achievement of my life. By chance, I bumped into Bobby in the street! I was walking into a shop when his friend recognised me and introduced us. He got quite emotional. It's nice to think Bobby is still here today because of me.

Driven by evolving customer segments, rapid technological advances and shifting competitive dynamics, the market here is set to undergo a significant growth in assets - shaping itself up to be a powerful engine of recovery and a force for good in a world facing uncertainty and upheaval. However, as with other industries before it, wealth management seems to be at a crossroads given the significance and magnitude of these change drivers. These seismic shifts raise the question of what the next decade will bring, and what opportunities are lying in wait as a result. A SIZEABLE, CAUTIOUS MARKET Recent decades have witnessed meaningful changes to the Irish wealth-management industry's structure and dynamics. The Central Bank of Ireland's Irish household net worth index increased at pace from 2000 to 2006, hitting a peak in 2007 ahead of the global financial crash which was triggered largely by the housing market. It took a full 10 years before those levels were reached once again. Since 2018, household net worth has only increased and more recently has swelled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, with liquid cash held at banks reaching record levels of (EURO)140bn earlier this year. Best estimates indicate the Irish savings marketplace is worth roughly (EURO)350bn.There is also a significant cash balance of (EURO)125bn currently held on deposit with credit institutions. These deposits grew by (EURO)14.2bn in the year to December 2020, most likely due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, which prompted the Irish public, which has always had a conservative approach to saving, to become even more cautious. Another (EURO)250bn or so is invested with life assurance companies. WEALTH MANAGEMENT IS EVOLVING There are several factors fuelling strong growth in Ireland's wealth management sector. These include a rapid increase in the country's population of mass affluent and wealthy citizens - we have one of the fastest rates of growth in Europe; one of the toughest inheritance tax regimes in the world; a rapidly increasing pool of inter-generational wealth being transferred; and a growing pool of young investors fuelled by the increasing number of tech and financial companies based in Ireland - partly due to Brexit. However, historically, wealth managers here have focused largely on execution-only services, and it is estimated this model accounts for more than two-thirds of the Irish market in terms of volume. In comparison, discretionary investment management services make up about 70pc of the UK market. While the marketplace is changing and many providers are now evolving beyond the traditional execution-only model to embrace additional services, wealth managers should consider the scope they have to pick up business previously catered to by UK discretionary investment managers who can no longer serve clients operating in Europe without a physical presence there. Roughly half of financial services firms have moved some operations to Europe because of Brexit. According to EY's Brexit tracker, the decision to leave the single market has caused £1.3 trillion of assets so far to leave UK shores for Europe. Ireland's legal and regulatory framework is similar to the UKs, and for UK-based asset managers it offers a good cultural fit. NEW OPPORTUNITIES ARE EMERGING While the wealth management industry is expanding due to changes in consumer behaviour, it is also benefiting from constraints on life assurers. Life products are balance sheet-intensive given the need to hold capital against them to meet regulatory requirements. In contrast, the wealth management model does not have such capital requirements. Moreover, as a sticky annuity-style business based on flows, it offers attractive returns. The sector is also anticipating a significant potential boost on foot of negative interest rates. Deposit and cash markets, a long-time staple of the Irish marketplace, are under significant pressure because of the ongoing low-interest-rate environment. Despite negative interest rate charging by some institutions, deposit levels are continuing to grow - but for how long? For longer-term savers and investors, it appears now is an opportune time to invest in markets both for income protection and growth, rather than run the risk of unwanted inflationary pressures. Faced with negative rates on bank savings, wealth managers see a potential opportunity to convert idle cash into longer-term asset growth. Equities and bonds provide investors with a traditional route to the market, but wealth managers are also promoting the advantages of alternative financial products. For example, structured products provide a partial capital guarantee (in return for a cap on the potential upside of the product). For cautious investors unused to market exposure - a large proportion of the current Irish market - such products are proving appealing. Separately, the Irish pension environment is due a shake-up with auto-enrolment offering a potential growth opportunity for wealth managers. The reform is due to be introduced in 2022 in an effort to bridge the pension gap caused by increasing life expectancy. Employers will have to introduce a workplace pension scheme (if one does not already exist), enrol their employees into it, and contribute a percentage of an employee's salary to help fund their retirement. Although details have yet to be announced, life insurance companies may be the initial beneficiaries of auto-enrolment funds, although in time the broader wealth management sector could also benefit. There is no doubt that Ireland's fund management industry is strategically positioned to be a progressive, truly cross-border industry, but client expectations are rising rapidly. Although advances have been made in recent years, the adoption of technology by the Irish wealth management industry lags that of the UK and US. With reliance upon personal relationships, Irish wealth managers continue to focus on developing trust and offering a personal touch. However, there is a widespread acknowledgment among wealth management firms that many clients are looking for vastly improved digital access to their financial information - for things like virtual engagement, seamless app experiences, omnichannel support, and instant payments, which are all being set at a pace by industries outside of financial services. The Irish wealth marketplace is changing rapidly. Providers are evolving their offerings and product mix in response to changing client expectations and new opportunities. The potential for growth is vividly reflected in increasing competition between domestic firms and growing interest among international players. To achieve their goals in this increasingly dynamic market, wealth managers will need to plan how to respond to new investor demands and the broader market environment, not least in terms of their digital capabilities. For those that get it right, Ireland's wealth management sector can help to shape a future that is better for investors, shareholders, our economy, and wider society.

The campaign body is demanding that the Department for Infrastructure addresses the issue urgently, before the housing stock falls any further and impacts first-time buyers and the social sector. And it emerged that development has already stalled on a number of sites across the north, including a scheme in Newtownards to provide 440 much needed houses. The chronic underfunding of NI Water has been well documented, with dire warnings that unless additional capital investment is provided, the utility can’t connect new homes and businesses into its system, where in simple terms, they won’t even be able to flush their toilets. Drains for Development director Conor Mulligan said: “Demand for houses in Northern Ireland is massively outweighing supply right now. We need to build more homes, but planning permission is complicated and even if approved, there’s no possibility we can build due to foul sewer capacity being nearly, if not already, at capacity. “More than 90 areas currently have a freeze on development, preventing much-needed homes from being built. “Since its formation in 2007, NI Water has only received the recommended level of funding in a handful of years, which needs to be rectified urgently.” The group is commissioning a bespoke research project which will investigate the implications of the region’s poor wastewater infrastructure on homes and the economy. He added: “We urgently need a modern, well-maintained and sufficiently-funded sustainable water and wastewater network to allow more homes to be built. The Executive has committed to meet NI Water’s funding requirements for 2021/22 but this doesn’t go far enough. “Our group will continue to campaign for Stormont to prioritise this issue and ensure NI Water receives the multi-year funding required to address critical gaps in infrastructure. “Northern Ireland has just recorded the busiest month for the housing market since the 2007 boom, so the demand is there.” While in its final price control determination in May the Regulator endorsed NI Water’s investment plan, it does not mean that funding will be guaranteed."

I am not enrolled in my employer's pension plan and have a lot of money on deposit. I recently read something about risk and how people in my age bracket should not be afraid of taking some risk. What are your thoughts? A Loss of money is a big concern for people, especially when we consider how difficult it can be to earn it and save it, says Frank Conway, founder of financial wellbeing provider MoneyWhizz and a qualified financial adviser. Leaving a lot of money on deposit earning little or nothing by way of interest carries a risk that inflation will erode its buying power. Leaving nothing carries will If inflation is 2pc per year, for every (EURO)100 you have on deposit, in just one year, its buying power drops to (EURO)98. In other words, after a year, it buys just (EURO)98 worth of goods, Mr Conway says. So, just because you may have a lot of money held on deposit does not mean it is entirely protected. While you say you have an absolute fear of taking risk with your money, at your age, you have a ""capacity"" for risk provided you take a measured investment approach. For example, if you invest for at least three to five years, this should see any market fluctuations recover, he added. By opting out of your company pension scheme you are forgoing generous tax relief on contributions, tax-free growth of any investment growth within the pension fund and also, tax-free drawdown allowances on retirement. It's a major way of building a significant nest egg for your postemployment years. Q The to I purchased a property in 2007 for (EURO)220,000. It was for a second property used for the rental market. Four years ago I gifted the property to my son. The property was independently valued at the time at (EURO)150,000. Can the loss, (EURO)70,000, be treated as an allowable loss for Capital Gains Tax purposes and therefore set against other potential capital gains? A Unfortunately, the short answer to this question is no, says the consumer tax manager at www.Taxback.com Marian Ryan. The capital loss in relation to this property cannot be offset against other potential capital gains. Disposals between connected persons are deemed to take place at the market value of the property in question. If the person making the disposal made a loss, no relief is available, except against gains on another disposal to the same connected person, Ms Ryan says. So in simple English the reader can only offset his Capital Gains Tax (CGT) loss relating to this property against any CGT gains he has, or will potentially have in the future for disposals made to his son. The CGT loss relating to this property can't be offset against any other CGT gains. Ms Ryan says it is also worth noting that there is no CAT (Capital Acquisitions Tax) liability for the man's son, assuming this is the first gift under the Group A threshold he has received. Any future gifts/inheritances he receives may be subject to CAT if he exceeds his Group A threshold of (EURO)335,000. on or interest inflation Q I noticed that the US Federal Reserve has said that it will begin to increase interest rates in about two years' time. Does this mean that my mortgage costs will probably rise here? A The US Federal Reserve has given the signal that it may begin to increase interest rates in 2023. This is a big departure from the indications given by it in 2020. From an Irish perspective, the actions of the US Federal Reserve will have a mixed impact, says Frank Conway, founder of financial wellbeing provider MoneyWhizz and a qualified financial adviser. From a savings and borrowing perspective, since our interest rates are controlled by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, as long as the ECB maintains interest rates at their current levels, interest rates for saving and borrowing will remain unchanged. So, if you have a variable-rate mortgage, the cost of your monthly payments will remain as they are now. The same is true for interest on savings accounts, if you earn any, Mr Conway said. Where the actions of the US monetary authorities can have an immediate impact is on the value of your pension. relation be This is because your pension may have funds and other underlying assets that are both directly and indirectly linked in various ways to the US economy where rising interest rates will have an impact. The reason the US authorities are taking action is broadly in response to inflation, Mr Conway added.

He determinedly avoided using that word, but he committed himself to the integrity of the United Kingdom. Not every Labour leader thought the same way. Back in 1971, Harold Wilson framed the idea that Britain should announce an intention to withdraw from Northern Ireland and make way for Irish unity within 15 years. He would have had the support of some Conservatives, including a former prime minister, Alec Douglas-Home. In 1972, when Ted Heath was laying the groundwork for direct rule, Douglas-Home urged him to pitch for total withdrawal within a much tighter period than Wilson had contemplated, certainly less than a year. However, no one could do it. It was never going to be possible to go against the will of a Northern Ireland majority for the Union, no matter how fed up the rest of the UK was with the routine bother of governing such a divided and difficult place. That it would have been impossible to discard Northern Ireland seems less clear after the recent ruling that the Act of Union was ""impliedly repealed"" by the Brexit www.Protocol.No legislation is sacrosanct. Why did anyone think it was when even the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which, we're often reminded, was enshrined in an international treaty, were changed in the St Andrews Agreement. There, the mechanism for the selection of First and Deputy First Ministers was removed from the vote of the whole Assembly to appointment by the largest party in the respective communities, ie the DUP and Sinn Fein. The deft self-interest behind that idea doesn't seem so smart to the DUP now. After the next election, nationalism is still likely to be the smaller designation, but to have the largest party and, therefore, the First Minister's post. Much as the Labour movement accommodated republican sentiment, when faced with the responsibility of government it pulled back, probably more fearful of triggering a civil war than of any legal restraint. But I digress. Kevin MacNamara, who was most sympathetic to the nationalist case, was replaced by Mo Mowlam when Tony Blair took office in 1997. While she was personally genial in her dealings with republican leaders - to the point of exasperating unionists - her mission was to secure talks towards the Good Friday compromise, not to arrange for the ditching of helicopters into the Irish Sea as Britannia pulled in her skirts. It is interesting that Starmer can not use the word 'unionist' to describe his position. That would suggest in the minds of hearers that he was sympathetic to a unionist party or two. One of his defenders tweeted that Labour was, of course, committed to its sister party, the SDLP, which he described by a word they never use, 'republican'. The SDLP does want a united Irish republic, so it is republican, but that word would associate it too strongly, and toxically in the minds of many, with Sinn Fein. Isn't it interesting that big political forces like these have to be coy about their intentions: Labour's unionist intentions; the SDLP's republican intentions? The difficulty both create is that they concede the ownership of key political aspirations here to others. Starmer's bigger concern for the Union now is that Scotland might leave. Labour's long-term hopes rest on rebuilding in Scotland. He will have to make the case for the Union in Scotland and, therefore, he has to be as committed to it here. Which is not to say he is insincere. But if he is a unionist at heart, he should be able to say so and in doing so he would gain a new power; the power to turn on the DUP and accuse them of mangling an ideology he holds dear. That could be exciting to watch. But how would the SDLP react? The Labour Party has done it the big favour of not competing against it for 50 years, on the flawed understanding that they are 'sister parties'. Well, sisters may borrow each other's makeup, but go their separate ways. The SDLP is not a Labour party and hasn't been since Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt left. Maybe if it had to fight a real Labour Party, properly organised from London, it would revive its old Labour instincts and sharpen up its message around social and liberal concerns. That might be a good thing. And maybe if Labour could use the word 'unionist', others who also want to push a border poll back into the distant future would use it, too. That would demonstrate that what distinguishes our current unionist parties from the huge numbers who don't vote for them, or don't vote at all, is not their commitment to the Union, but their more eccentric chauvinism and moral conservatism. The language with which we discuss our tendentious politics is deeply flawed. We talk of Catholic nationalists as if there was a knowable number of people who believed in both a united Ireland and the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. We talk of Protestant unionists to cover everyone from saved evangelicals to radical Methodists, people who are pro-devolution and anti-devolution. Both categories include devout and prayerful people who are social conservatives and atheists, pacifists and those who endorse murder. This language is useless other than for preserving sectarian perspectives and inhibiting alternatives. Starmer had a chance to be bolder. It wouldn't have cost him any votes.

""I've been really struck in the three days I've been here that across the board, the trust in the Prime Minister has been burnt through. ""For decades, there's been a sense that the British Prime Minister has to be an honest broker. That's gone. That has to be re-established first. ""If I was Prime Minister, trust would be number one on my agenda."" Sir Keir has been in talks with all political leaders in Northern Ireland during his visit and said he has been struck by the sense of betrayal felt, particularly by the DUP, who had propped up the Conservative government under former Prime Minister Theresa May, only to be ""missold"" Brexit by Boris Johnson. ""I don't want to speak for the DUP, but I do think that betrayal is deeply felt,"" he said. ""The Prime Minister knew what he was negotiating. He personally negotiated it and then he mis-sold it. He wasn't straight about the consequences of the Protocol. ""Now he's pretending that fixing it isn't really his responsibility. He may think he's fooling the people of Northern Ireland, but the people of Northern Ireland are not fools. ""I don't think there will be a fanfare welcome to a DUP conference again in a hurry,"" he added. Sir Keir will be back in London before the Eleventh Night bonfires, but he said he has told Northern Ireland politicians they must show real leadership over the next week. ""I know one thing from my time here is that you don't fly over from London and tell leaders what they should be doing. ""Every leader of every political party, every community, has a duty to de-escalate and make sure we can get through the next week in a peaceful way. ""The political landscape in Northern Ireland is fragile right now. There are lots of moving parts and that adds to the sense of insecurity and discomfort that is felt across Northern Ireland. ""That is when you require leadership. That is when you require trust. That's when you need your honest broker. All three are missing from this Prime Minister. But we must not always talk about Northern Ireland in the negative. ""Northern Ireland has been a positive where I've seen so many individuals, community leaders, communities themselves coming together. I was at Forge Integrated Primary School on Thursday and there are amazing things going for it. ""People don't want to feel discomforted or fragile, they want leadership to unleash that positivity. There's a huge amount to be positive about, but it needs strong leadership from the PM and that is distinctly lacking."" Among those positives, Sir Keir and Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Louise Haigh walked across the Peace Bridge alongside Sara Canning, partner of murdered journalist Lyra McKee, and heard about the long campaign for justice for Lyra during a meeting at the Guildhall. The group discussed Lyra's commitment to diversity and equality, her legacy and the huge work still to do to deliver on the promise of peace for a younger generation. ""Lyra McKee was the very best of Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""She dreamt of a future of equality and reconciliation. ""Sara has fought a determined campaign for justice. Her determination to build on Lyra's legacy, and to build a lasting peace, is humbling and demands all our support. ""I was honoured to cross the Peace Bridge, a symbol of reconciliation between two communities, with Sara."" During his visit Sir Keir - a former Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales - also met a number of victims at the Wave Trauma Centre in north Belfast and said plans by the UK Government to introduce a form of amnesty for all Troubles-era offences were wrong. ""Any discussion about legacy has to start with the victims,"" he said. ""Promises have been made, promises haven't been kept and I think that's where the conversation has to start. ""We have to find a way forward but they very strongly feel that you can't sit in London and draw a line, it has to start here, with them, conversations about how we move forward. ""I don't agree with it (an amnesty), I don't think that it is the right plan and I think any discussion about legacy has to start here in Northern Ireland, sitting down with victims and those most affected, and I would urge the Prime Minister to take that approach rather than the one he is taking."" Despite opponents accusing Boris Johnson of mishandling the Covid pandemic and mishandling Brexit, Sir Keir's Labour Party has struggled to make any inroads to the Conservative lead in the polls. Sir Keir, though, senses that could be about to change. ""We've lived through the most extraordinary year and a half,"" he said. ""In a crisis, in a pandemic, people naturally pull towards their government. You can see that across the United Kingdom, you can see that across Europe. ""The vaccine roll-out, which has been the work of the NHS, has been successful and that sense that people have that they need their government to succeed because their health and their livelihoods depend on it has been very real. We're now coming to the end of that."" And he feels his party's by-election win in Batley and Spen last week was a sign of things to come. ""It shows we know how to win against the odds, that we can win when we pull together and as we go into the summer, I think this is now is an opportunity for us to make very strong and bold arguments about what happens after the pandemic and the kind of country we want to build. ""We can harness the spirit of the pandemic, which was a spirit of communities coming together, and begin to forge that into the better future we all want.""

But Stephen Bradley (right) had insisted there was more to come from his side, not least away from the 36 degree furnace that was Bratislava. And he was on the money as it was Slovan feeling the heat here with Rovers fans daring to dream of Champions League progression after Graham Burke's early penalty. Even more so when Richie Towell scored an unstoppable thunderbolt just after the hour to level matters. But Vladimir Weiss' 73rd minute strike against the run of play - and following a foul on Roberto Lopes in the build up - punctured hopes of a clash with Young Boys. While the win on the night will prove important for coefficients, the deflation was etched on the faces of the Rovers players as they applauded their fans at the death. They left nothing behind in a blink-and-you' ll-miss it cracker that had it all, but must make do with the Europa Conference League - the draw for which is next Monday. Rovers knew this would be a tall order and it certainly looked like a long night in the making when Slovan pinged two balls at Alan Mannus' goal inside five minutes. But the visitors couldn't capitalise and Rovers were in dreamland themselves soon after when Slovan skipper Vasil Bozhikov upended Burke in the box. Burke nailed the penalty and the 1,500 fans allowed into Tallaght Stadium sounded like multiples of that as the venue rocked to the Rovers tune performed by a fired up side desperate to put its best foot forward. At times, the Hoops lived a charmed existence at the back. Lopes was caught cold on two occasions, leading to rapid attacks but the centre-back refused to let those moments of concern rock him and he steadily became more and more influential. Mannus also had a ropey moment of his own before the break, when a poor short kick-out was almost intercepted. That could have been curtains, but by then the goalkeeper had already pulled off an heroic save for the second game running. His late penalty save in Bratislava last week gave Rovers their lifeline here and his 19th minute double save to deny Joeri de Kamps from distance and then David Hrncar with a close range diving header allowed the hosts cling to their rescue mission ambitions. But to flip the tie, or at least force extra-time, Bradley's charges had to discover a sense of adventure in the final third. They rarely threatened in that area during that opening half but, playing into the south stand after the break, they upped their game. Skipper Ronan Finn unleashed an angled drive that had goalkeeper Adrian Chovan clawing the ball out of the top corner, and suddenly the Hoops had the scent of opportunity in their nostrils. And they didn't have long to wait for their next reward. Rory Gaffney found Towell with a tremendous 64th minute ball from the right ball from the right and the Hoops big summer signing took one touch before unleashing a rocket high into the Slovan net to spark chaos in the stands. And yet the joy only lasted nine minutes. While Lopes argued that he was fouled in the build up to Weiss's low, slotted winner, the Croatian referee was having none of it. So Lopes took matters into his own hands and, with nine minutes to go and forced a flying save from Chovan. Aaron Greene - off the bench - and Liam Scales both went close to forcing extra-time in the dying stages but although there was only one side attacking, that elusive third goal just wouldn't fall Rovers' way.

In the world of interiors, that often translates to upcycling, repurposing and reusing old materials, but also consumers helping communities. We produce a dizzying amountofrubbisheachyear(13milliontonnes in Ireland alone) and despite our recycling efforts, only some of it will escape landfills. The good news is that it is easier than ever to buy more consciously for our homes, and designers and retailers are becoming more conscious of their footprint, turning everything from plastic bottles and discarded clothes into furniture. IKEA recently reduced its carbon footprint some more with a new kitchen design made from plastic bottles, and just last week, the Swedish giant launched a Buy Back service in Ireland, where customers can sell their old IKEA furniture back to the retailer. On the high-street, H&M's conscious collection is produced from at least 50pc sustainable materials. But what does that actually mean? Essentially, the heart of sustainability is the production of pieces that are ecofriendly; using materials that are a renewable resource, grow easily and have proven durability, and are bought from local sources to minimise the impact of shipping. Ireland and sustainability go far back; it's in our history. We are craftspeople used to working with the land, from Donegal tweed to artisan furniture makers. Stable of Ireland and The Tweed Project are two Irish companies run by women that make beautiful contemporary Irish textiles, their feet still very much in native production but with a growing European fan base. The Tweed Project recently launched a collection that reuses quality vintage fabrics. Dublin-based Kathryn Davey is a sustainable studio that uses rainwater and native plant-based dyes to transform natural materials into table linens and accessories that range from subtle ochres to dramatic pinks and moody blues. Before the onslaught of flat-packed furniture, what we had in our homes was usually handmade family heirlooms, passed down from one generation to the next. Inspired by nostalgia, the father-and-son woodworking team behind Bunny & Clyde create timeless designs for kids' rooms that can be altered as they grow. The humble homeware store is also having a moment with the likes of Kim Gray General Store, reuzi, Irish Design Shop, Mira Mira and The Kind all focused on curating a collection of home-grown and sustainable products with timeless appeal that promote the small maker and a minimal-waste lifestyle. As part of its ongoing sustainability strategy, Irish candle company Max Benjamin, using natural soy wax, is the first Irish company to introduce candle refills, and all vessels are fully recyclable thanks to its organic paint coat. Giving furniture a new lease of life also helps steer it away from landfill. The renaissance of upcycling has created a clutch of talented designers and artists pushing beyond amateur restoration into the realm of bona-fide design businesses like Copperfish and Kopper Kreation, both Irish studios using salvaged materials to create lights. Over 90pc of furniture at Dublin furniture store Home Street Home is sustainable and ethically sourced and The Store Room in County Laois is a well-stocked hub for the vintage lover, where you're likely to find unique, industrial-style pieces made from reclaimed materials. The ultimate goal, of course, is to live in a world where responsible design is not atypical, but if we've learnt anything this year, it is that we can do a lot more with a lot less.

Insurers that provide liability and property cover to businesses lost money on average in the five years to 2019 despite rising premiums, making many lines of business unprofitable, according to new figures from the National Claims Information Database (NCID). Meanwhile, insurance costs have doubled in some sectors, dramatically increasing the baseline costs of doing business. Providers recorded a sector-wide operating loss on employer's liability, public liability and commercial property insurance of 3pc of total income in the period 2015-2019, reversing modest profits of 5pc in the preceding five years. Premiums rose in this period by 24pc for most policies, however, increasing the cost of doing business for small business customers. Yet with 63pc of total income being spent settling claims - primarily in the courts - insurers are still losing money, making the Irish market unviable for many of them. The NCID data reveals that personal injury settlements of less than (EURO)150,000 which go through litigation cost on average 21 times more than those processed through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB). As 84pc of all claims are now settled via court action - a figure that has been rising for years - litigation is now a dominant factor in the cost and availability of commercial insurance in Ireland. Compounding the problem, insurance companies have been making less in investment income to offset unprofitable underwriting, while the cost of reinsurance has also eaten into profits. Increasingly, insurers are exiting portfolios in certain segments of the market where the long-term finances are unsustainable, making it impossible for certain businesses to operate. Insurance costs have doubled in some sectors. Arts, entertainment and recreation businesses experienced a 105pc increase in premiums in the period 2009-2029, almost all of it in the second half of the decade. Other businesses, notably creches, have become effectively uninsurable as companies willing to provide cover have dwindled or disappeared. ""This report lays bare the scale of the greed that has driven the current insurance crisis, enriching underwriters, brokers and lawyers at the expense of Irish charities, community and voluntary groups, sport and cultural organisations and SMEs struggling to make ends meet,"" said Peter Boland, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform. ""It is clear that personal injury litigation is the mother lode of many Irish solicitors' income, at the expense of plaintiffs, policyholders and society."" Premiums are expected to continue rising for years to come as insurers try to earn their way through this part of the underwriting cycle, although new judicial guidelines on injury awards should push more cases to lower courts of the PIAB, reducing claims costs.

""Credit unions have to put on reserve a percentage of savings so the more savings we have, the more we have to keep on reserve so less investment income,"" chairman Paul Cooney noted in South Dublin Credit Union's 2020 annual report.  ""Again, investment income has decreased and now banks have started charging the credit union for monies sitting in current accounts. To survive we need to lend more so any members thinking about borrowing throughout the year, your first stop should be your credit union,"" he said. Long-standing members with more than EUR 25,000 with the credit union are not allowed to increase their level of savings, and if they go below the threshold they will not be able to go above the figure at a later date.  South Dublin's bank charges rose to EUR 69,332 in the year to the end of September 2020, up from EUR 48,352 in 2019, and just more than double the level of 2018. South Dublin's loan book grew by just 0.8 per cent last year, a period that was impacted by the pandemic. Mr Cooney described this as a ""good performance"" amid ""nervousness in borrowing"".  Bad debts Some 852 loan applications were approved, with a value of EUR 6.6 million. This brought total lending to members to EUR 12.2 million at the end of last September, equating to 1,657 loans.

Shamrock Rovers face Slovan Bratislava in the Champions League qualifiers tonight looking to make history by becoming the first Irish side to overturn a two-goal first-leg deficit. The abolition of the away goals rule should, in theory, make that easier. But it also increases the likelihood of penalties being needed. Having saved a Vladimir Weiss spot-kick in injury-time in Bratislava last week, Mannus has form in that department. And he admits he watched the Euro 2020 final shootout between Italy and England more as a student of the art of goalkeeping than as a football supporter. Mannus, 39, said: ""I was messaging a friend as it went to penalties. He asked, 'What do you think?' and I said, 'I think they'll save two penalties each'. ""Just because Donnarumma and Jordan Pickford ... for all the criticism some of the English people and media put on him, he's got a mentality of wanting to prove to everyone he can play at the highest level. He's done really well for England. ""I still thought he'd save at least two of the five. I thought the save on to the post was brilliant. ""I do watch it and try and think what side they are going, but it still becomes a guess really. There is no way of knowing for sure. ""Sometimes you look at the run-up and think they're going one side and they can pull the other way. ""Now a lot of the players, they do the stutter and stop and try and see which way you're going to go, which makes it harder. ""Some of them almost come to a complete stop before they hit it which isn't allowed I don't think, but it makes it more and more difficult for the goalkeeper then. ""Marcus Rashford watched the goalkeeper the whole way. And if they do that, they risk not hitting the ball cleanly because they are not looking at the ball and then they can miss, like he did. ""Still, regardless of those things, you either stay in the middle or you pick a side and go, and if you pick the right way you put pressure on yourself to save it."" Mannus saw first-hand how good Donnarumma is last September when AC Milan came to Tallaght in the Europa League. The Italian giants won 2-0, though the big Northern Irishman's main memory of that game is a save his counterpart made from Aaron Greene. He added: ""We actually spoke about it afterwards, we talked a lot about when Aaron got in during the first half, he saved down to his left. ""Aaron said afterwards that he made it so hard for him because he stayed back. If he'd come out towards him, it would have allowed him to pick somewhere past him. ""He stayed back and got a big, strong left hand to it. ""I thought he was brilliant against us. In general, he's one of the top goalkeepers in the world. I got his top after the game last year. ""I've got a few jerseys over the years - Neuer, Ter Stegen, Casillas, Buffon, Donnarumma and a couple of other ones."" Donnarumma is now off to Paris to join PSG - and Mannus hopes to travel to a few more European cities himself in the coming weeks, starting in Switzerland. But Rovers know he will need to be at his best tonight if they are to get to the second round to face Young Boys Berne. Elimination would mean the consolation prize of a third-round place in the Europa Conference League. Given they are two goals down, a clean sheet would go a long way towards helping the Hoops' chances. But Mannus insists the key is players not letting anything get to them. He said: ""We just need to do whatever we've to do to get through. ""If they score, it makes it more difficult, we've to score one extra on top of the two already. ""I don't think if they score we're out of it completely. We've shown already this season that we can come back from being in a bad position. ""Against AC Milan last year, what pleased me more than anything after the game was that we tried to play, as opposed to being safe. ""From goal kicks, we tried to play out from the back, we tried to play rather than everybody going up the pitch and we'd go long. ""That was the pleasing thing for me. That's what we need to try to do now, to be brave. ""If we tried to do it against AC Milan, we can do it against anybody. ""When we did it against AC, there were times when we got into the final third to create chances. It shows you we can be good at it."" Rovers are close to full strength for the clash with the Slovakian champions, with Neil Farrugia and Chris McCann the only absentees. You either stay in the middle or you pick a side and go, and if you pick the right way you put pressure on yourself to save it.

Only that, with such a young and gifted England team, it is unlikely to be 55 years before they tread this path again. And they may be better prepared the next time, if it is soon enough. These players, even this manager if he can put himself through it again, hardened and experienced by nights like this; by a defeat at the hands of opponents who ultimately held their nerve in this most unforgiving of arenas. Italy were resolute to the end. Resolute even in the midst of a ragged, imperfect shootout, when as many missed from the spot as scored. Twice, it appeared to be going England's way, when Jordan Pickford saved the second from Andrea Belotti and then dragged England back from the brink by tipping anchor man Jorginho's fifth against a post, a brilliant save. In between, though, the fearlessness, the confidence, the rejection of historical traumas that was said to be the DNA of this side, somehow deserted them. First Marcus Rashford (right) missed, then Jadon Sancho, finally and saddest of all, Bukayo Saka, a smiling star of this team, whose beaming face astride an inflatable unicorn came to symbolise its freshness and optimism. He looked broken by the end, almost inconsolable. In many ways, he couldn't have a better manager to get him through this, but Gareth Southgate will not have wanted to be the mentor who sees a young player through the pain he once felt. Ultimately, the better team won. Italy edged the shootout much as they edged the match, a bit wiser over the course and distance, carrying less weight, that famous 30 years of hurt that, now nearer 60, with new verses being added all the time. Quite simply, Italy, now 34 games unbeaten, are further ahead of where England stand now. Just. But perhaps they won't always be. That is all England can cling to. Hope. The country is back to talking in past and future tenses again. What was, what might be. For a fleeting moment ? and initially for 65 minutes in which England led ? it was possible to talk in the present. The here. The now. England were bringing it, as the song says, home. Home to a euphoric Wembley. Home to a country that has never got used to the length of this wait. Home despite the pressure, the expectation, the critics, the doubters. Home, despite it all. That dream, sadly, was not to be. For while the denouement was painful, what preceded was just a plain old game of football. Italy are a very good team. The best here. Better than Spain, Belgium, France, Germany, better than England, too. The climax may feel too raw right now, too painful, but the fact is England led from early but were worn down by Italy's press and pressure. Italy shaded it, and had the better chances, but could not be set apart in open play. It needed the shootout. It needed the worst way to lose, the most acutely stressful way to win. But that's finals for you. The hope is England get more used to them than they have been, at which point nights like this will not feel so desolate. Italy have lost World Cup finals in shootouts. They have been on this journey many more times than England. Don't think it doesn't matter. The whole match felt like an exquisite torture. Anyone who has ever trotted out the cliche about an early goal settling the nerves has plainly never scored one in the opening two minutes of a final. Did it hell settle nerves. If anything, Luke Shaw scoring from England's first attack of the game actually increased the tension, because now Southgate's players really had something to lose. Yet would it have been any different, whatever had happened? Probably not. England have not travelled this path often, if at all in most lifetimes. There was a mania around the stadium, a frenzy. Footage of ticketless fans storming the perimeter fences, gaining illegal entry to the stadium. UEFA denied it. Those with eyes on the place would contest they lied. Social distancing in the upper tiers was not replicated below. People stood wherever they could to get a view. Was it Covid safe? Of course not. If UEFA admitted that, the game couldn't go ahead. So they pretended what we all saw happen, did not happen. And then something equally unbelievable unfolded before our eyes. England scored, from their first attack. Given what occurred from their last attack in a major tournament final in 1966, that made it two goals in little more than two minutes in consecutive Wembley finals. The problem being they were 55 years apart. Ironically, the goal came after a nervous opening. Harry Maguire misjudged his first pass of the game and put it out for an Italian corner. Yet no sooner had the locals turned to each other, all nervous as kittens, to say England needed to settle down, ease into the game and relax, the ball was in the back of Italy's net. What a move it was too, started and finished by one of the men of the tournament for England ? Luke Shaw. He began by feeding Harry Kane, who was in a deep position ? what's he doing there asked those who haven't been paying attention this summer ? and he strode through Italy's midfield before picking out Kieran Trippier on the right. Kyle Walker went on a rapid overlap but Trippier ignored him. He was looking to the middle for a target, delaying, delaying, until he got clear sight. And then that figure emerged. Tripper's cross travelled over Raheem Sterling in the middle and fell instead to Shaw, arriving deep left. He has never scored for England. What a time to change that narrative. The ball pitched directly in front of him, so much so that at first it was thought he volleyed it. He didn't. Shaw struck the ball on the slightest of half volleys, off the inside of the near post and past goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. What a goal: 119 seconds on the clock. Sterling says he used to hear the Wembley roar growing up at his house near the stadium. This one might have shaken the panes at the Southgate residence in Harrogate. On the touchline, the manager allowed himself one understated clenched fist punch; with 88 minutes plus injury time to go, it doesn't do to go full Alan Pardew. There followed a 20 minute spell when England had Italy reeling. They couldn't get in the game, indeed looked stunned by developments. Gradually, that changed. This is a very good Italian side. In the eighth minute a foul by Shaw, albeit more of a collision as he pointed out, resulted in a freekick which Lorenzo Insigne put over the bar. After 35 minutes, Federico Chiesa finally got away from the mighty Declan Rice and struck a low shot just wide. In between, Italy toiled without threatening. It was only in the 50th minute, when Sterling bundled over Insigne and referee Bjorn Kuipers gave a free-kick on the edge of the D that England appeared vulnerable. Insigne put it wide, to deafening cheers. Yet pressure was always building, in the circumstances. As England dropped deeper, so Italy's grip on the play grew stronger. Insigne cut in on the left and forced a fine save from Pickford after 57 minutes and then, five minutes later, England's goalkeeper parried a low shot from Chiesa. From Italy's next corner, came the equalising goal. The moment England were not first to the delivery at the near post, they were in trouble. The ball flew to Marco Verratti who won the physical battle with Mason Mount and steered his header goalwards. Pickford tipped it on to the post but Leonardo Bonnucci was first to react, the winner of an old-fashioned goalmouth scramble. Tails up, Italy might have finished it minutes later. A long ball over the top found Domenico Berardi who broke through England's defensive ranks and beat Pickford in the chase, shooting over. It will be argued England could have been more positive, got on the front foot, introduced Jack Grealish and others sooner in the contest, when Italy seemed to be tiring. Yet defence and a solid shape has served England well this summer. England stuck to what they knew. Maybe as the players grow in experience, they can expand their repertoire. That's for the future. It's still all about the future. The present will just be filed away with the past, amid all those years of hurt.

According to internal emails, the primary purchasers - ""anecdotally"" - tended to be large European and international pension funds either through direct sale or providing funding for property deals. The emails said investment funds tended to be more active at an earlier stage for the original purchase of land or the funding of construction. An email from a Department of Finance official said: ""While there is CSO [Central Statistics Office] data on purchases by institutions, it does not provide any real colour around the specific type of institution purchasing in the market."" It said there was ""limited data"" available outside of what was being provided in research from the private sector. Controversies   The details are contained among records from the Department of Housing as it grappled with controversies over the purchase of property by institutional investors and later the fallout from the sale of most of the 170-home Mullen Park estate in Maynooth, Co Kildare, to one company. An internal note said the number of new homes purchased by non-private individuals - including local authorities and approved housing bodies - had almost doubled between 2017 and 2020 from 2,090 to 4,132 per year. It said, in 2019, about 23 per cent of non-private purchases of any home (including new ones) - or 3,054 purchases - had come from the financial and insurance sector, including banks, holding companies, trusts and funds. Another 16 per cent - involving 2,078 purchases of any home - were by real estate management companies, and other companies buying, selling, renting or operating their own properties. The note also said nonprivate individuals sold more properties than they bought and had done every year since that type of record was first kept in 2010. Further legislation  Internal briefings following the purchase of most of the estate at Maynooth detail how government measures to tackle institutional buyers would be targeted primarily at lower density housing estate type developments where ""viability should not be an issue"". It said it would ensure institutional purchasers could not buy up homes where there was clear demand by owner- occupiers. The briefing said: ""Provision is made that if no market emerges, the developer can apply to the local authority, and they can discharge the condition if they are satisfied that the houses have been made available on the market for a year."" It added that the Attorney General had advised further legislation might be required to ""bolster this provision"", though the department believed it possible they had sufficient powers already. The briefing said access to new homes by first-time buyers was a key part of the housing market, which was generally split 1:3 between new homes and second-hand home purchasers."

From Asia to London to Dublin there was a mood of uncertainty around. Share price falls were put down to profit taking, worries about over-valued tech stocks, bond prices, inflation and the Delta variant of Covid-19. Among those hit hardest were bank shares. This, of course, has arrived just a couple of weeks after Paschal Donohoe, Minister for Finance, said he would begin a process of selling down the State's 14pc shareholding in Bank of Ireland. This decision was probably being mooted in the Department of Finance in early June with the minister announcing the decision on June 23. In early June Bank of Ireland shares were trading at (EURO)5.18. By last Thursday they had shed 16pc and were down to round (EURO)4.29, which cut the value of the State's stake by about (EURO)132m. A month ago, things might have looked a little different. The bank's share price had been climbing steadily enough and had increased by 138pc in a year. Donohoe said he was divesting of the stake over the next six months because things were looking up for the economy, for investors and therefore for banks. The obvious question was why not keep the shareholding then, if things are looking up? There is a bigger picture here though. With the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank, there are just three retail banks left in the market - AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB. With the State holding over 70pc of two of them and 14pc of a third (namely Bank of Ireland), it is surely time to begin some kind of retreat from that scale of State ownership of the sector. If the remaining banks are set to gain so heavily from the economic rebound and a virtual duopoly in the market, perhaps someone might consider making an offer for Bank of Ireland, which is headed up by Francesca McDonagh If that were to happen, the State would find itself deciding to back a takeover offer from an international group, which would bring to an end the stewardship of a bank from Dublin which has been there since the late 1700s. Alternatively it could try to block a takeover going unconditional by voting its 14pc against a bid. Either way, it would place the minister of the day in a tricky situation. Offloading the shareholding in the space of six months should be a cleaner break. But has the Government got the timing right? A few weeks after the decision to sell, things look a little more shaky. AIB shares had climbed over 100pc since last November, but are down nearly a quarter in the last month. PTSB is in a different situation in so far as so few of its shares trade each day. Last Thursday, when Band of Ireland and AIB shares were down, PTSB's were barely moving. But this was on the back of just 11 transactions worth a grand total of (EURO)15,000. Extricating the State from AIB and PTSB will be a lot more complex when the time comes. Offloading a State majority stake in a listed entity won't be happening any time soon. Selling Bank of Ireland is easy but getting a good price amid so much market uncertainty won't be. DONOHOE WILL TOE LINE ON CORPORATE TAX - EVENTUALLY The Government appears to be playing a risky game by not supporting the new proposal on a minimum effective corporate tax rate on big corporations of at least 15pc. Finding ourselves in the company of Barbados, Hungary and just a few other countries in not signing up to the plan, looks pretty bad. We have already shipped some reputational damage. But as ever there are nuances and details yet to be worked out. Ireland might well end up supporting a 15pc rate, but first wants to see whether it will be higher than that and also how it will operate. As long as there are finer points to be finalised, the Government has clearly decided that shipping some reputational damage for a while might be worth it. At the end of the day, the amount of money corporations pay in tax is going to increase. Some aspects of the new proposals which were discussed at the G20 meeting in Venice will result in more tax being paid. But where and how is still up for grabs. KPMG compiled a chart of corporate tax rates charged by dozens of countries over the last 10 years. It is extraordinary to read through the list and see how corporate taxes have been falling practically everywhere. Few countries, apart from 0pc tax havens, are as low as ours but the trend over the last 10 years has tended to be downward. For example, the average for the EU in 2011 was 22.5pc and is now 20.7pc. In the US it was 40pc a decade ago and is now 27pc. In the UK it has fallen from 26pc to 19pc in the last 10 years. Belgium reduced its rate from 33.9pc to 25pc, while France dropped its rate from 33.5pc to 26.5pc. The aforementioned Barbados went from 25pc to 5.5pc, and Hungary went 19pc to 9pc. The actual amounts of tax paid ultimately depend on the offsets and the various company structures that are allowed and governed by individual tax treaties. In Ireland, our problem wasn't the 12.5pc but the billions of euro flowing through holding companies registered in Ireland but not tax resident here or anywhere else for that matter. The Government will eventually toe the line on what is agreed but not until everything is agreed. TWO BROADBAND SUBSIDIES AREN'T BETTER THAN ONE The national rural broadband scheme saga rumbles on. It now appears that due to Covid, just half of the targeted 115,000 homes for this year will be passed. The delays mean some homes will be waiting several more years before getting the broadband they want. In the meantime, Senator Timmy Dooley of Fianna Fáil, suggested a grant scheme for homes to install satellite-based broadband. It might seem like a good idea to offer remote houses a State grant to help them get some decent broadband until the national scheme can get to the house. But it is doubling up State supports - money now and subsidised fibre later. If it is such a good idea why didn't they just go down that road instead of a delayed complex rural scheme that will cost (EURO)2.1bn? The German government has announced its plan to offer subsidy vouchers to people in rural areas who cannot gain access to high speed broadband. The vouchers are worth up to (EURO)500 to help with satellite setup. Our national scheme is supposed to deliver speeds of 30Mbs and anyone receiving over that is not included in the State plan. This figure is based on previous EU guidelines about what is defined as ""high speed"" broadband. Broadband is seen as an essential part of the aspiration of revitalising rural communities through remote working. Further delays to the scheme are a real setback. Ultimately when the national scheme has completed its work, whenever that may be, the level of take-up might be surprisingly low. It is possible that satellite alternatives, could have done the job more quickly. IF THINGS ARE LOOKING UP, THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS WHY NOT KEEP THE SHARES THEN?

Not that we might be travelling far this year. There will probably be few of us getting away for a sunshine holiday this summer. Those of you lucky to get away at all will no doubt be holidaying in Ireland. If the dearth of self-catering accommodation is anything to go by, that is where most families will be headed. With that in mind, putting some thought and planning into your family holiday is well worth the investment of the time. I was in Connemara recently with our Headspace Adventure summer camps and we regularly passed by a couple out walking the roads with their baby carried by one or other in a sling. I was reminded of those days when my own children were that tiny and how comparatively easy it was to take them on holiday. While babies typically come with a lot of gear, they are quite portable. Small babies don't complain about being brought to museums, or other sights that you want to see. You can still set the entire agenda for the trip and what you do. If they are comfy in a sling or a buggy, they are usually happy to go where you go. Once they hit the toddler years you have your work cut out for you, since they require constant attention, have minds of their own in terms of where they wander and what they become entranced with. Toddlers can be fussy, oppositional, fractious, heedless, and demanding (and that is before you've even left home). Many parents consider them to be nightmare holiday companions. It is well worth planning your days around your toddler's nap times. Keeping some semblance of a sleep routine will mean that they don't get over-tired, and they will be less prone to tears and tantrums. As your children grow up, the prospect of a holiday being more than just simply ""a change is as good as a rest"", becomes a reality. School age children often are the best holiday companions. They tend to be the most appreciative and the most adaptable. They are naturally inquisitive and can get a real kick out of exploring. For example, they are of an age where a day at the beach is an endless opportunity for new and fun things to do, from paddling, swimming, digging in the sand, rock-pooling, picnicking and more. You may even have time to sit and read a book for yourself, if someone else is on duty to keep an eye on where the kids are wandering. Given that you may be doing some type of roadtrip this year, it is important to plan for the car journey. Simple games, books, audiobooks, and lots of parental attention will probably be required to keep children entertained. Think about where you'll stop en route. Perhaps avoid my inclination which is to get to the destination as quickly as possible, but rather plan for a walk or a picnic at some interesting location along the route. With older children and teenagers, it can really add to a family holiday to include them in the decisions that will affect the whole family. Your destination is ideally chosen by consensus, or at least after discussion. Any activities or day trips that you plan during the holiday will need to consider the varied interests of different family members. Staying in places where they are likely to meet potential friends is also often a big consideration for many families. It sounds a bit mean, but you do have to manage your children's expectations. If money is tight then their holiday won't necessarily mean meals out every night and an uninterrupted flow of spending money. If children are expecting a break from chores, for example, but you know you'll be self-catering, then they need to know in advance that dinner-time chores will still be on the agenda. You may have to manage your own expectations too. Think about what counts as a successful holiday or break for you. Does it simply require that the children have fun and you have a change of scenery, or do you need some ""me-time"" to feel like you've had a chance to recharge before getting back to work? If you need the me-time then you need to factor it in early in the planning, or you may feel disappointed and frustrated. Indeed having an adaptable and flexible mindset is a real benefit when it comes to holidaying, especially here in Ireland where the weather can lead to a change of plans at a moment's notice. Being prepared to stay relaxed and calm can help when things do have to change or adapt. A final thought on family holidays is to bear in mind that even with all of the planning and excitement that comes with going away, the change and unpredictability that being away from home entails might also bring shades of anxiety to the fore. That anxiety may appear as snappy irritability or even full-blown rows and disagreements. There is a lot to be said for the predictability of going to the same place year after year. Maybe your staycation location this year might become your family's go-to destination every year.

Walter Watson is the largest family-owned structural steel fabricator on the island of Ireland. Both the pandemic and Brexit have thrown up challenges and, while it is not yet clear what the full impact of both will be, the company believes they can be managed. Turnover was slightly down to just over £52m, but the company posted a profit of £4.2m for the year to the end of December 2020, according to the firm's annual report. The Castlewellan-headquartered firm employs 230 people here, in Co Kildare and in Scotland. It has supplied steel for many projects across the UK and Ireland, including most recently the Southern Regional College in Armagh, the new Green Pastures Church in Ballymena, and Dairy Hall Leisure Centre in Newtownards. Covid-19 brought ""an unprecedented level of market volatility and economic uncertainty"" to the steel industry, but the company reports that it has managed to deal with the impact of the pandemic without encountering any major difficulties. However, the future is unclear as the global picture remains fluid, the company added. Brexit and the introduction of the protocol have been challenging, particularly in relation to price rises for materials, demand and navigating customs.

""We hold strong supplier and customer relationships to work through the initial implementation period."" Quotas introduced by both the European Union and the UK has led to an increase in prices over the last six months to the end of June.

Kilkenny is fun!; Mick Jagger saw its potential back in the 1960s, now Kilkenny Castle is the centrepoint of a classic home holiday destination",FALSE,"OUR five-year-old son has a very important question for the ticket checker at Kilkenny Castle. 'Is the king and queen in today?' Fair play to the young woman, she doesn't miss a beat. 'I'm afraid they're not here today, they've gone on their holidays,' she replies. 'Oh, where?' shoots back her dogged interrogator. 'To England, they've gone to England for a while.' When you delve back into the history of this magnificent 800-year-old castle on the banks of the River Nore, her explanation is not too far from the truth. The last family to own Kilkenny Castle, the Butlers of Ormonde, whose ancestors bought it in 1391, moved out of the city in 1935. Their once-great fortune much depleted thanks to rising taxes and an economic depression, they went to live in London, leaving their former home unoccupied for 30 years. In 1949, it was inherited by Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess and 24th Earl of Ormonde, and by 1967, now stripped of most of its furniture and artwork, he decided to sell it to the local Castle Restoration Committee for the ceremonial sum of £50. 'The people of Kilkenny, as well as myself and my family, feel a great pride in the castle,' he stated. 'We have not liked to see this deterioration. We determined that it should not be allowed to fall into ruins. There are already too many ruins in Ireland.' The handover party later that year looks bonkers. You can see archive footage of it online, dozens of unsmiling local matrons in their finest Sunday hats gathered in the back courtyard of the decaying castle, watching as Minister of Finance of the day, Charles Haughey, makes small talk. AT one point the Marquis of Ormonde hands over a large ornate key to a Mr James Gibbons, Haughey's parliamentary secretary, who is also the chairman of the Kilkenny Castle Restoration and Development Committee. Then, out of nowhere, and for no reason that I can find fully explained anywhere, across the courtyard bounds a very young Mick Jagger. Wearing a long green embroidered cloak with a hood, over a pair of orange pants, presumably in honour of our national flag, he is accompanied by his then girlfriend Marianne Faithfull. Naturally the couple attracted a lot of attention. It certainly helped up the glamour stakes of the otherwise rather dull looking occasion. Jagger is reported to have told journalists that we 'just came to loon about'. There may not be any lithe rock gods gambolling across the 50 acres of rolling parkland of Kilkenny Castle on the days we visit, but that doesn't make our experience any less rich. It's a stunning property right in the heart of the city, and we spend most of the Saturday and Sunday of our weekend stay there. It's the first full weekend of hospitality restrictions being partially lifted and the mood in this pretty midlands city is bordering on euphoric, helped by some fantastic weather. From the taxi man who picks us up at the train station to bring us to Hotel Kilkenny, to the barmen at Lanigans Bar on Rose Inn Street who have commandeered the back alley for outdoor seating, everyone is thrilled 'to be back'. It's been a long time since Kilkenny has welcomed so many visitors at the one time, and there will undoubtedly be a settling in period as restaurants and bars train in new staff and get used to operating under new and changing protocols. So patience is the name of the game, there are some queues and it can take a little while to get served but there is also a lot of goodwill and understanding as places find their feet. After a late afternoon browse through the excellent Book Centre on High Street, we have a couple of drinks at Lanigans, and then it's back to Hotel Kilkenny and its restaurant for that night's dinner. The dining room is bright, airy and well staffed with a good children's menu while the bedroom is comfortable and spacious for the three of us. I'd been advised to book the leisure centre for swimming appointments, and the next morning our son is delighted to be back in a pool to spend an hour kicking up a storm. It's about a 20-minute stroll into the city centre and we've booked tickets for a self-guided tour of the castle, which are free this summer thanks to an OPW initiative to help give the tourism industry a kick-start. It's easy to do on my phone and you don't need to print anything off. With an impatient five-year-old in tow, we don't get to spend as much time as we'd like to walk through the beautifully restored rooms of this castle. But even Dan is impressed with the majestic picture gallery wing, which has roof beams carved into ornate dragons. The local farmers' market is now trading on Saturdays at The Parade, just at the Castle gates, so we stop here for some fantastic food at very reasonable prices. It's brilliant to watch people milling from stall to stall in the sunshine. After another stroll through the city, trying to find a place to have a late afternoon drink proves a little difficult with a weary child. Booking ahead is probably something we need to get more used to this summer. Instead we head back to the hotel where we get a table on its large terrace and spend the next few hours reading and colouring, before ordering dinner from their bar menu. It's a very relaxing way to spend the evening. Our train home is not until late afternoon the next day, so it's back to the castle and the playground there for a few hours and another stroll around the extensive grounds. We get a table in the front terrace at Louie's Bar on Patrick's Street for a super lunch, and spend an hour or so enjoying the Sunday afternoon buzz. At one point I pop over to Folkster and the beautifully stocked Yesterdays gift shop, just for a 'quick look'. I'm not disappointed and manage to find a couple of bits to bring home. It's been a wonderful weekend away, our first in a very long time. We've been blessed with the weather, but it's also easy to see why Kilkenny has always been a top tourist spot. There may be a few teething problems over these first few weeks, but they take their service industry seriously. There's plenty of choice, you'll just need to do a bit of research and booking before you go. While it's unlikely you'll spot a rock god in a green velvet hooded cloak, you'll definitely be surrounded by people intent on getting some satisfaction.

US district judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said Avenatti (50) ""had become drunk on the power of his platform"" in betraying his client, a youth basketball coach, for his own gain. ""Mr Avenatti's conduct was outrageous,"" Judge Gardephe said. ""He hijacked his client's claims, and he used those claims to further his own agenda, which was to extort millions of dollars from Nike for himself."" The sentencing caps a precipitous downfall for a once-obscure lawyer who in 2018 became a cable news and social media fixture, disparaging then-president Donald Trump and even flirting with his own White House run. Avenatti still faces three other criminal fraud trials, including for defrauding Ms Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. In the Nike case, Avenatti was convicted for threatening to expose the sportswear company's alleged corrupt payments to families of college basketball prospects, unless it paid up to $25 million for him and another lawyer to conduct an investigation. Nike has denied wrongdoing. ""The verdict and sentence speak for themselves,"" it said in a statement. Recordings showed Avenatti telling Nike lawyers he would ""blow the lid"" on the company and wipe $10 billion off its stock market value unless it bowed to his demands. Prosecutors said Avenatti was counting on a big payday to cover his debts. Avenatti was also convicted of defrauding the coach Gary Franklin by not telling him he wouldn't settle unless there was an investigation. Judge Gardephe read extensively from Avenatti's taped words, including multiple profanities, before imposing the sentence, which includes an additional three years of supervised release following prison. Losing his way Avenatti's lawyers have said he will appeal the February 2020 conviction. Before learning his fate, Avenatti choked up as he admitted to losing his way following years of ""fighting for the little guy against the Goliaths"". The divorced father of three apologised to Mr Franklin and others. ""TV and Twitter, your honour mean nothing,"" Avenatti told the judge. ""Everyone wants to ride in a limo with you, but very few are willing to sit next to you on the bus. Even fewer, your honour, are willing to take your calls from prison. ""I and I alone have destroyed my career, my relationships, my life,"" he added. Mr Franklin had been upset that Nike stopped sponsoring his programme and said he wanted simply to restore their relationship. - Reuters"

The company, which was valued at $95bn ((EURO)80bn) in a fundraising round earlier this year, hired New York headquartered Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as a legal advisor on its early-stage listing preparations, according to Reuters. Stripe is said to be considering a direct listing, rather than an initial public offering, which means the company would not raise fresh capital. However, a direct listing would protect shareholders - most prominently the founders, Limerick-born brothers John and Patrick Collison - from having to dilute their ownership stakes. Fintech company Wise successfully direct-listed on the London Stock Exchange in what many commentators saw as a test case for firms going public without underwriters. The Collisons have repeatedly played down the prospect of taking the company public, citing Stripe's low capital intensity and ease at securing private funding lines. The Reuters report, which cited unnamed sources, said there has been no decision on the timing of the stock market debut. It added that the next step would be the hiring of investment banks later in 2021, according to the sources. However, a listing would be unlikely to happen this year, two of the sources told Reuters. The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Stripe and Cleary Gottlieb declined to comment. In March Stripe said it would add ""at least"" 1,000 jobs in Dublin over the next five years after the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (Isif) made a (EURO)42m equity investment in the firm. The online payments firm is now the most valuable ever private technology company in Silicon Valley following that funding round. Stripe employs over 300 people in its Dublin engineering hub at present, which also serves as the international headquarters of the business. Stripe processes payments in 42 countries, counting clients such as Deliveroo, N26, Intercom and Donedeal among its thousands of customers. Patrick and John Collison have a combined net wealth of (EURO)16bn, according to estimates by Forbes - nearly twice the wealth of the other four listed Irish billionaires combined. Last month John Collison bought the Abbey Leix Estate in Co Laois, one of Ireland's largest and most prestigious country estates. The giant demesne, adjacent to the picturesque town of Abbeyleix, has been on the market for two years with joint agents Sotheby's and Colliers International quoting a price of (EURO)20m.

For their sake, you hope Tuesday's semi-final at Wembley does not go the distance. When this tie ended all square, you got the feeling Spain would have preferred a coin toss rather than a shoot-out, especially given Switzerland had dispatched France via this method in the last round. For not only had they missed their last five penalties - including two saved by Switzerland's Yann Sommer in the Nations League ? their finishing was so poor in the previous 120 minutes that a decider reliant on accurate shooting felt like putting a matador into the bull ring wearing a red Spain jersey. It was, you suspected, only ever going to end in tears. And that it did. However, it was the cheeks of Switzerland's Ruben Vargas that were sodden come the end of a woeful round of spot-kicks, in which five of the nine were missed. Vargas sent his into orbit and, when Mikel Oyarzabal converted Spain's fifth for 3-1, Switzerland came crashing down to earth. Moments earlier, they had dared to dream when Sergio Busquets cracked the base of the post from the opening penalty, before Mario Gavranovic converted for 1-0. It would have been a brave victory given they played the final 42 minutes with ten men. But their hopes began to fade when Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon saved a pair of lame efforts from Fabian Schar and Manuel Akanji. They were more akin to back-passes. Rodri missed another for Spain but, somehow, they scraped through, into the final four of a major competition for the first time since they won this competition in 2012. Shoot-out hero Simon had been guilty of a horrendous own goal against Croatia in the last 16 but he insisted he would forget his penalty heroics just as quickly as his gaffe in the last round. 'You have to forget the errors quickly but you have to forget the successes quickly, too because we have a semi-final to face now,' said Simon. 'I did get a little bit carried away at the end but it was all the rage and relief coming out. It was a moment's euphoria - now we have to reset for the next game.' Swiss scorer Xherdan Shaqiri could only watch the spot-kicks play out from the sidelines having been substituted in the second half, but he said: 'I'm really proud of the team. Penalties are a bit 50-50. I was nervous watching the shoot-out. I think we just lacked a little bit of luck today.' The quality of the penalties - or rather, the lack of it - had reflected the contest that went before. To think, this pair were the glorious winners from 'Manic Monday', Luis Enrique's Spain defeating Croatia 5-3 and Switzerland beating the world champions after a 3-3 draw. But this felt more like 'Black Friday', a fairly bleak contest that fell some way short of the entertainment and colour that has illuminated this wonderful tournament. In mitigation, perhaps it was that the exertions of the previous round had taken their toll. Switzerland struggled from the off in St Petersburg, only to find a second wind after a dismal first half and force extra-time thanks to Shaqiri's equaliser on 68 minutes. They had trailed for an hour to that point, Spain having taken an early lead from a corner, although Koke's delivery was hardly deserving of a goal. Overhit and outswinging, it looked more like a clearance as it bounced out of the penalty area. His team-mate Jordi Alba, lurking 25 yards out, was never the intended recipient. But the Barcelona man returned a volley that was destined to creep inside the post until Denis Zakaria stuck out a loose leg and diverted it into the opposite corner. Own goal said UEFA, which was harsh on Alba, who was denied his first for his country in four years. The Swiss were better after the break, even if such improvement was achieved by simply showing some ambition to attack. It would have been noted that Spain's central defence was terrified when Croatia launched a late aerial assault. Turns out a low ball can spread just as much panic. There was close to zero danger when a hopeful clip forward was intercepted by Aymeric Laporte. At least, that was, until he ran into defensive partner Pau Torres and the ball squirmed loose for Remo Freuler, who squared for Shaqiri to hook into the bottom corner from ten yards. A peseta for the thoughts of Sergio Ramos, watching at home having been left out by Enrique amid disputed fitness concerns. Even on one leg, however, he would have used it to clear that ball. Then, on 78 minutes, came the decision that all but ended Switzerland's hopes of victory by any other means than a penalty shoot-out. England's Michael Oliver had refereed well in this tournament but his decision to flash a straight red at Remo Freuler after he slid in and took both the ball and body of substitute Gerard Moreno was harsh in the extreme. It was a yellow card at worst but there was no VAR intervention and the Swiss were left with a mountain to climb. Not that Spain could take advantage. Moreno missed a hat-trick of chances in extratime, although he made amends when lashing home his penalty. Even still, their semi-final opponents could well be advised to play for penalties.

Mr Costello said he became aware of CETA (Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement) in about 2016 when the Green Party was among a wide alliance of NGOs and community groups campaigning against it. His concerns centred on provisions for investor protection and an investor courts service, and he believed the impact of those means CETA must be put before the Irish people in a referendum. Any time Ireland previously gave up sovereignty to create international bodies such as the International Criminal Court, it did so only after a referendum, he said. His concern about how Ireland feels legally able to proceed with ratifying CETA without asking the people, who are sovereign, has yet to be answered. The Dublin South Central TD outlined his concerns to Ms Justice Nuala Butler at the opening yesterday of his action concerning the constitutionality of the investor protection parts of CETA. Unconstitutional  Mr Costello is concerned those involve an unconstitutional transfer of sovereignty and judicial power. If the investor court system is brought into force without being sanctioned by a referendum, that would be contrary to articles 15 and 34 of the Constitution, he claims. His proceedings, against the Irish Government, Ireland and the Attorney General, raise significant constitutional issues concerning the power of the executive to ratify CETA, as well as issues of EU law raised by the defence. CETA is under ratification by various EU member states and the government had intended it to be ratified via Dáil motion before Christmas.  The hearing is listed for four days. "

Disturbances worsened as Zuma challenged his 15-month prison term in the country's top court after weekend unrest by pro-Zuma protesters in his home province of KwaZulu- Natal (KZN) and Gauteng, where the country's largest city Johannesburg is located. Police said 219 arrests had been made, as opportunistic criminals appeared to take advantage of the anger some feel over Zuma's incarceration to steal and cause destruction. Any confrontation with soldiers risks fuelling claims by Zuma and his supporters that they are victims of a politically motivated crackdown by his successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma (79) was sentenced late last month for defying a constitutional court order to give evidence at an inquiry investigating high-level corruption during his nine years in office until 2018. The decision to jail him resulted from legal proceedings seen as a test of post-apartheid South Africa's alight amid vandalism and rioting. Government intelligence sources said the bodies of four people had been found - at least two of them with gunshot wounds - in Gauteng. Two deaths had occurred in KZN, and all six were being investigated. Zuma's imprisonment marks a significant fall from stature for a leading figure in the liberation-movement-turned-ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC). He was once jailed by South Africa's pre- 1994 white-minority rulers for his efforts to make all citizens equal before the law. Mr Ramaphosa said on Sunday the violence was damaging efforts to rebuild the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic. The corruption inquiry that Zuma has refused to co-operate with is examining allegations that he allowed three Indian-born businessmen, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, to plunder state resources and peddle influence over government policy. He and the Gupta brothers, who fled the country after his ouster and are believed to be living in Dubai, deny wrongdoing. Zuma also faces a corruption case relating to a $2bn ((EURO)1.69bn) arms deal in 1999 when he was deputy president. He denies the charges. ability to enforce the rule of law, including against powerful politicians. ""The South African National Defence Force has commenced with pre-deployment processes to assist law enforcement agencies to quell the unrest that has gripped both in the last few days,"" the military said in a statement. In a virtual hearing, Zuma's counsel asked the constitutional court yesterday to rescind his jail term, citing a rule that judgments can be reconsidered if made in the absence of the affected person or containing a patent error. Legal experts say Zuma's chances of success are slim. Footage shot by local TV channels yesterday showed a mall in Pietermaritzburg on fire, with a nearby highway closed to prevent further violence.

Nowadays we've replaced popstars with money magnates and today's teens watch shows like Ireland's Rich List 2021 (Monday, RTÉ1), cheering on their favourite billionaires as they move up and down the money charts. Everyone loves a list like this, though revolutionary socialists, in fairness, tend to compile them for totally different reasons. I think about the richest people I know - Enya, one of the Jedwards, Judge from Wanderly Wagon, the ghost of Charles J Haughey, the nefarious British and Bosco - and I smack my lips in anticipation even though a cookery element has not yet been introduced. Ireland's Rich List 2021 is hosted by affable Richard Curran, whom we meet on the grounds of a stately home over which he presides dressed in a nice suit. He doesn't wear a monocle and top hat while chomping a cigar, which I feel is missing a trick, but I appreciate the general effort.  Curran is a relative pauper. Like the rest of us he can more typically be found wearing a barrel and braces while stealing delicious pies from the windowsills of trusting 1930s housewives. All of his possessions can be carried in a bindle and when he opens his wallet a fly flies out. This is basically what everyone on this rich list sees when they look at the rest of us. Watching this programme reinforces the fact that everything has a price. I can see you're getting defensive. ""Surely some things are priceless beyond measure,"" you say. ""Like the smile of a child or a beautiful sunset."" Having watched this show, let me say: WRONG! Nice sunsets can be created by firing thermonuclear warheads into the sun and the smile of a child is worth exactly EUR 47.50. This is a programme about people who dare to dream and their dreams involve supply chains, bar charts, golf and pictures of themselves shaking hands with other identical people in suits in newspapers. They are winning the game of life, at least on points, and most but not all of them are men. It reminds me of when I was, for a time, the biggest boy in sixth class. Yes, another name for this programme could be The Biggest Boys in Sixth Class. ""And now for our next Big Boy!"" I imagine Curran saying. ""He truly is the Biggest Boy."" The Big Boys who appear in this episode are, for the most part, anonymous, publicity-shy recluses in drab suits who have made their fortunes by scaling up conventional businesses without even once purchasing a pet leopard or inviting Drake to a party.  There are no Elon Musks here, naming their children after randomised email passwords, fighting with strangers on the internet and wanting to be launched into space for the laugh.  The one colourful exception is Dermot Desmond, who has a flashy nickname: ""The Kaiser"". He is called this because he has a big moustache. This is, in the context of Irish riches, the action of a crazed nonconformist. If I was as rich as him I'd go the whole hog and wear one of those pointy 19th century Prussian helmets, leather boots and a load of medals. This isn't to say that Ireland's Biggest Boys aren't deeply unusual in their way. The very rich are, as far I can see, hoarders like those on the TV show Hoarders: Buried Alive. They mightn't be hoarding old pizza boxes, junk mail or bird skeletons. Instead they are unnecessarily stockpiling money, loads of money, more money than they could ever need.  Perhaps it has always been thus. Perhaps in times past a caveperson sat atop a mouldering mound of mammoth meat while a hungry hominid in a furry tie praised their business acumen. Nonetheless, I feel the word ""billionaire"" should be treated less like an economic designation these days and more like a diagnosis. Look, I get why people want to be a bit rich. To paraphrase Karl Marx: being poor really, really sucks. A desire for riches is really a desire for security, a reduced state of anxiety and nice things. But I feel like if this existential fear of the future and lust for stuff isn't staved off by, I don't know, the first ten million, then there's some fascinating psychology at play. Ireland's Rich List is filled with input from some of Ireland's best financial journalists, painstakingly explaining how the various tycoons made their money (nobody says: ""class interests, sparse regulation and artificially manufactured scarcity""). But I'd also love some contributions from philosophers, psychologists and, possibly, mystics about why these people want the money.  As the contributors outline the ingenious ways in which each person on the list squeezed additional millions from their existing millions or lost a few paltry millions from their existing billion, I find myself repeatedly saying: ""Yeah, but why though?"" I crave additional insight, narrative context, sentences like ""so to compensate for never truly feeling loved, he purchased a chain of haberdasheries"" or ""powerless in the face of death and terrified by the void, he brought his waffle company to the stock market for an IPO"" or ""believing his penis to be haunted as the old fortune- teller had predicted, he streamlined all of his fidget spinner factories and made a billion"". Let me add here that all the aforementioned examples are fictional billionaires invented for the purposes of illustration and the billionaire that you legally represent is fantastic and doing everything for the right reasons. He is the Biggest Boy of all.  Wealth creation  On the same night, Channel 4 aired Kathy Burke's Money Talks, in which the very likeable Burke visits rich people to learn about their lives (next week's episode is about people who are struggling). This programme does set out to ask the ""why?"" question but the answers are woolly. Many of the subjects are just notionally ""rich"" because they're influencers selling a myth of wealth creation in defiance of widespread downward mobility.  The programme-makers forgo deeper analysis, preferring to lean on Burke's charm and her own lived experience of both poverty and relative wealth. It's an interesting prism through which to look at these things but it isn't enough. We don't get any real sense of what constitutes wealth or the economic chaos that leads people to crave wealth, and Burke is too kind-hearted to ask hard questions.  Also, most of the people here are impoverished, relative to the people in the previously discussed programme who have mislaid bigger fortunes in the back of taxis. I suppose it does give me a strange sense of pride as an Irishman that we have so many Big Boys, even if I'd like to tax them into being smaller boys (mere millionaires). For their own good, like. "

You can't be one of Irish sport's most compelling figures for 20 years without people rummaging through your bins, finding a few scraps. He is the square-jawed mystery wrapped in an enigma, clad in a long-sleeved navy jersey. But he still walked our streets, breathed our air, punched our ex-International footballers. Intense There's a standard yarn. One depicting the bracingly intense competitor whose only apparent weaknesses are a short fuse and an allergy to bull***t. 'Bull***t' being Cluxton's broad categorisation for all the add-ons to an inter-county existence other than football itself; the training and the playing. He doesn't do interviews. He doesn't drive a sponsored car. He has turned down significant financial incentives to endorse various products and events. The joke around 2013 was that Jim Gavin had to make Cluxton Dublin captain just to get him to hang around for trophy presentations. These Cluxton chronicles tend to be all similar in tone, divided into two sub-categories. They're either: a) Examples of his extreme dedication to football and the fiery expectation of same from those around him. Or: b) His complete aversion, bordering on hatred, for any of the other bells and whistles attached to playing for Dublin. But especially the media. Both feed the aura. So almost as interesting as 'Cluxton: The Footballer' is 'Cluxton: The Enigma'. He is the most influential player of the most successful intercounty football team of all time. And he'd prefer to keep his thoughts to himself, thanks very much. Famously, when asked - for an official player profile - what was the best advice he ever received, Cluxton answered: 'Don't talk to the media'. The irony here being that this is, by far, the most used Cluxton (right) anecdote in the countless profiles written about him since. So far as anyone has been able to make out, this dislike for the fourth estate, or at least that part of it that covers Gaelic games, began sometime around 2003, when he was roundly blamed for Dublin losing an All-Ireland SFC qualifier to Armagh after being sent off. Columnists and pundits weren't alone in their condemnation. Tommy Lyons, Dublin manager at the time, effectively did the same thing. On 'The Sunday Game', Joe Brolly was particularly scathing. In a subsequent column for The Sunday Independent, Brolly claimed he offered to shake hands with Cluxton some years later when they met at a function. According to Brolly, Cluxton responded: ""Before you do that, I want to tell you that for years I thought of breaking your jaw. I will never forgive you for what you said."" Once, on a tour of city centre hostelries after an All-Ireland win, Cluxton was handed a drink by someone he didn't know. He politely declined, explaining he didn't take drinks from journalists. The baffled man replied that he wasn't, in fact, a journalist. He owned the pub. For all Cluxton's success, criticism during the early years stung. Back in 2007, in a rare interview to promote a goalkeeping clinic, Cluxton - then in his pre-icon stage - was asked about the boom/ bust nature of Dublin's support. ""It's funny that you go to a game up in Ballybofey in the mid-winter and you have a handful of supporters there,"" he said. ""You go into Croke Park in the first round and you are playing anybody and it's packed to the gills. You are kind of saying to yourself, 'where are all these coming from and do they even support the game, or are they just looking for a day out?' ""I suppose in Dublin, though, you probably have more critics than you have supporters. They don't understand that term, I don't think."" Team-mates whose standards dipped, even microscopically, were given even shorter shrift. Once, Jack McCaffrey told a story about his first training session with the seniors, before which each member of the squad introduced themselves. The county of origin of the jersey McCaffrey wore that evening was probably irrelevant. But in this case, it happened to be Cork. ""Hi, I'm Stephen Cluxton,"" greeted his new captain. ""Welcome aboard. Now don't wear that f***ing thing down here again."" If this is to be the end, he seems unlikely to be too sentimental about it. When Tomás Ó Sé handed him the match ball after the 2011 All-Ireland final, Cluxton accepted it and then casually kicked it over the sideline as he walked away from his celebrating team-mates. To Ó Sé, it was a gift; a memento of Cluxton's defining act. To Cluxton, it was just a football he didn't need. Perhaps though, the anecdote that sums him up best, comes from the pages of Dub Sub Confidential, John Leonard's award-winning memoir. In 2011, not long after kicking the most significant point in Dublin GAA history, Cluxton was selected to captain Ireland in the International Rules Series. The games were in Australia, where the local media had worked themselves into a state of irate disbelief that the visiting captain would not be speaking to them. One morning, Cluxton and Leonard (living in Australia then) had lunch in Melbourne. His former team-mate/rival asked about the furore. ""At the end of the day,"" Cluxton explained, ""I'm an amateur sportsman who plays the game he loves. I don't want the media or the attention. I'm a school teacher who has to go into his class on a Monday morning. ""I don't get paid to talk to the media. It's not my job to speak to them. It's my job to teach kids science. The rest is all b****x."" And so, the less he said over the years, the greater Cluxton's legend grew. Even now, four days before the Leinster semi-final, we, the Gaelic football consuming public, have no idea whether Stephen Cluxton is Dublin's captain-at-large or a legendary, retired, now ex-inter-county footballer. That the possibility of a return, however remote, still exists is testament not only to his immense talent and influence, but also those enigmatic qualities. Maybe he'll be back. Having ""stepped away"" from the squad for the first six months of the year, perhaps Cluxton will shuffle quietly back in at some point during the remaining weeks. Or more likely, he has hopped down off the inter-county carousel without anybody truly figuring him out, save for a few third-hand anecdotes about supposed idiosyncrasies. Like the final scene in The Usual Suspects, when the horrified detective realises he's been sold a litter of pups. Meanwhile, Keyser Söze, having convinced the world that he never existed, reveals himself only briefly before disappearing. And, like that, he's gone.

The closure of the national flag carrier's cabin crew centre has been a hammer blow and the future is uncertain. John Meagher reports",FALSE,"hat we fear in this area is the sound of silence - and there has been an awful lot of silence lately."" 'W Patricia McCarthy is talking about how the pandemic has had such a seismic impact on Shannon Airport and the lack of airplane sound has been all too apparent. The former mayor of Clare served on the now defunct Shannon Town Council from the early 1980s and, in the words of one local, ""knows Shannon and the airport like the back of her hand"". ""You would hear cargo planes coming in,"" she adds, ""we know their sound. But there are very few passenger planes."" There's an eerie silence in the terminal building too. A small number of Ryanair flights arrive and depart every day, but there has not been a single Aer Lingus plane at Shannon since April 2020. And with the announcement earlier this year that Aer Lingus was to close its crew base at Shannon, a move which directly affects 126 cabin crew and ground staff, McCarthy is concerned about the immediate future of an airport that has provided a gateway to the West for decades. ""We have to have an aviation policy and that policy can't just be focused on Dublin. Governments have focused on building up capacity in Dublin, but to the detriment of our other airports, especially Shannon. ""If you're talking about Shannon and what it did over the years, it really was the hallmark of regional development but [successive governments] seem to think, 'Job done', and then they go and forget about us."" McCarthy believes Shannon's fortunes have been on the wane for years. ""The improved road network was supposed to help the likes of Shannon but rather than bringing people down from Dublin, it told people in the Shannon region how easy it was to get to Dublin Airport - and the huge choice of services there."" She notes that prior to the pandemic, busloads of tourists who had flown into Dublin were being taken on day trips to the Cliffs of Moher, but precious little was being spent in Co Clare. McCarthy is convinced that it was the emphasis on developing Dublin Airport as a major European transport hub that truly tarnished Shannon. ""You have six airlines flying out of Dublin to Paris, for instance, and the way to protect the future of an airport like Shannon is to spread some of that around."" In fact, Aer Lingus announced new routes out of Shannon in 2019 - including a new service to Paris - but those days feel far off now and many are wondering if they will return. Former Fianna Fáil TD and government minister Tony Killeen is especially concerned about Shannon Airport's future. ""The pandemic has had a very detrimental impact on aviation everywhere over the past 18 months, but my concerns for Shannon predate that,"" he says. ""The numbers in Shannon have been worrying for four or five years prior to Covid striking. ""It's generally accepted that the Heathrows and Dublins will recover to about 80pc of where they were at in 2019, but the regional airports - if they recover at all - will only get to about 50pc of what they were doing before the pandemic."" Killeen believes Shannon's difficulties can be linked to a decision to separate it from the auspices of the Dublin Airport Authority. ""Holding it as a state airport separate from Cork and Dublin was seen as the way to rescue it, but there didn't seem to be much research done and there's a general feeling now that the experiment failed. Instead of taking the benefits of being free from the old corporate structure, there was no credibility established with your own base [the Shannon region]. DECLINE IN PASSENGER NUMBERS ""Shannon also has the disadvantage that it's hinterland is very small in population terms, relative to other European airports. Obviously, you need to get maximum value from your own population area and we're not getting that. I can see very clearly that people are boarding buses to benefit from the motorways and Limerick tunnel and straight to Dublin Airport. ""Historically,"" he adds, ""people would chose to go via Shannon even if it was a little dearer - and yet when you look at the value offering, it might well have been cheaper. But in recent years, we missed out on the local buy-in to the airport."" The decline in passenger numbers can be gleaned from a period roughly a decade apart. In 2007, thanks to a huge rise in Ryanair flights, passenger numbers to Shannon reached 3.2 million. Fast-forward to 2018, and a significant reduction in inward and outward flights, and the number had fallen to 1.8 million. Meanwhile, in 2019, Dublin welcomed a record 32.9 million passengers. Some 3.4 million used Dublin Airport in August 2019 alone. For many years, Shannon had punched well above its weight. In the 1930s, a flying boat terminal was located at Foynes, Co Limerick to cater for transatlantic travel but with advances in technology, a landbased runway was built in nearby Rineanna. It was renamed Shannon Airport in 1942 and catered predominantly for BOAC services to Britain. In 1945, immediately after World War II, an arrangement between Ireland and the US was struck and the existing Shannon runways were extended. In September that year, the first transatlantic flight, a Pan Am DC-4 landed from Gander, Canada - and so began a significant aviation connection between Shannon and North America. Until the early 1970s, and the development of the Boeing 747, the so-called 'Jumbo Jet', aircraft travelling to Europe from the US frequently had to make a refuel stop and Shannon led the way. In what became known as the Shannon Stopover, millions of passengers en route to other parts of Europe, or returning to North America, would disembark at Shannon and spend a few hours there. Brendan O'Regan, the visionary businessman and one of the key drivers of Shannon Airport in its early days, created a new retail experience - duty free - to tempt the well-heeled passengers who found themselves in the terminal with time to kill. Duty free shopping began at Shannon in 1947 and it kick-started a revolution - today, O'Regan's brainchild can be found in every airport in the world and has long been seen as a key revenue source. There was considerable glamour in the early days of transatlantic flights and the Shannon region was caught up in it. Word would get out that a certain celebrity would be stopping off at Shannon for a few hours on a certain day and autograph hunters would be out in force. Charlie Chaplin liked to summer in Waterville, Co Kerry, and was a frequent Shannon passenger, but there was huge interest in the November 1956 visit of Marilyn Monroe - then the most famous Hollywood star on the planet - and her husband of five months, the playwright Arthur Miller. Press photos at the time show Monroe being served an Irish coffee. Legend has it that the beverage was first created by Joe Sheridan, the head chef at the restaurant at the Foynes flying boat terminal in 1942 or 43. It became popular in the US in the early 1950s when a travel writer with the San Francisco Chronicle wrote about trying the coffee at Shannon Airport and the recipe was soon adopted by the Buena Vista Café in the city. Shannon's reputation as a refuelling hub was also reflected in the fact that the Russian Aeroflot carrier started using the airport from 1975 as a stop-off between the Soviet Union and communist outposts such as Cuba and Angola. Aeroflot kept its own fuel storage facility at the airport. There was a controversy in 1994 when the then Russian president Boris Yeltsin, on a stopover at Shannon from Washington to Moscow, failed to meet Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and other Irish dignitaries. After circling the airport for an hour, the Aeroflot plane finally landed, but the Russians announced that Yeltsin was too ill to disembark. Reynolds' request that he go onboard to greet the president was rejected. It was widely assumed that Yeltsin, who had severe alcohol issues, was too drunk. Remarkably, the 'Shannon Stopover' persisted until 2008 despite much controversy. Some business leaders in this country said it was an unnecessary impediment to Irish trade and brought little by way or revenue to the economy. The arrangement, which had persisted since the 1940s, was formally ended thanks to the EU-US Open Skies Agreement. And, yet, Shannon's attractiveness to low-fare carriers such as Ryanair, as well as Aer Lingus's commitment to its base there, ensured that the road ahead was not nearly as rocky as some had feared. The pandemic has been a hammer blow, however, and there's considerable concern in the region that the airport that emerges in a post-Covid world will be a shadow of what was there before. ""I'm very anxious about the future,"" says one entrepreneur whose business is entirely dependent on Shannon airport. ""The Government has been kicking the can down the road during the whole pandemic. They seem to forget that as an island nation, we rely so heavily on aviation. Where's the vision for what happens after this? danger will a oneairport state' ""None of the local representatives in Dáil Éireann,"" he adds, ""have really fought for the airport with the exception of [independent Clare TD] Michael McNamara. Aer Lingus shutting its base is a terribly short-term measure and the Government should be doing everything it can to pour money into the sector."" Aer Lingus reported losses of (EURO)103m in the first quarter of this year while pandemic travel restrictions left it with a (EURO)361m loss for 2020. ""The cumulative consequences of the crisis over the last 16 months leaves Aer Lingus facing significant restructuring to rebuild its network and financial strength,"" said a spokesperson for the airline this week. ""This includes the permanent closure of the Aer Lingus cabin crew base at Shannon Airport. There has not been a flight out of Shannon since April 2020. The decision to close the Shannon cabin crew base was not taken lightly and a reversal will not be possible."" Aer Lingus says it cannot say when flights will resume from the airport, despite rumours they would begin again in September. ""The Shannon schedule for the duration of 2021, and beyond, remains under constant review,"" says the spokesperson. GATEWAY TO AMERICA For one Aer Lingus cabin crew member living in Limerick and formerly operating from Shannon, the job cuts and/or proposed redeployment to Dublin has been a bitter pill to swallow. ""I get that the airline has been losing millions of euro - but so too has every airline in the world. Where is the government intervention? We've already lost something major with Stobart Air and domestic air travel. Is all the focus just going to Dublin and to hell with the other airports? It seems that way to me."" For hotelier Michael Vaughan, owner of Vaughan Lodge in Lahinch, the financial health of the region depends greatly on the airport. ""There is a huge worry because if we don't maintain gateway services from at least three key cities in the US, we would lose a lot of bed nights in the area. My business is 75pc American golfers. They'd be coming in primarily from JFK and Newark airports. As it stands, you cannot get a seat into Shannon from any of those places in 2021. In the past number of weeks, I've seen about 50 cancellations of Americans that definitely wanted to come and stay and had the golf booked and everything."" Even though it is possible for some of these guests to fly to Dublin, many of them, Vaughan believes, are choosing not to and, therefore, Ireland is losing out on high-spending tourists because of Shannon's largely dormant state. ""Many of them are in their 60s and 70s and they don't want to have a two-legged journey. If they could fly to Shannon, they'd be 45 minutes from the golf course. There's a real fear that we're going to lose some of our competitive advantage in the region."" It's a sentiment shared by Sean Lally, owner of Hotel Woodstock in Ennis. ""One in 12 jobs in Clare alone comes from tourism,"" he says, ""and that's been hit so hard with the pandemic. Ensuring that Shannon Airport not just survives, but thrives is essential if we're to see the tourist spread shared in this region - if the emphasis is on getting them into Dublin, and not fully utilising the geographical benefit of Shannon to the Wild Atlantic Way, we will definitely lose out here."" Lally says his conversations with US tourist agencies suggest that a buoyant Shannon Airport will be important when travel resumes like before. ""The message I'm getting is that for some tourists, if they can't get into Shannon, they won't come to Ireland at all. ""We need a multi-year plan for investment into Shannon. Look at what's happening in Europe in places like Germany, France and Italy - they're investing billions in the aviation industry because they're thinking long-term."" Ennistymon music promoter Denis Vaughan is one of the organisers of Save Our Shannon Airport (SOS) campaign. A protest is being organised for Ennis on July 24. ""The pandemic has exposed weaknesses in Irish aviation and policy is needed to safeguard valuable national assets like Shannon Airport. I can't stress to you enough just how vital a resource it is to the mid-west and western regions. It is vital that government acts now to support the thousands of jobs that depend on the airport for their livelihoods. ""Our government must work to incentivise airlines to put services into Shannon and to get acting now."" Vaughan has a pessimistic outlook if significant funding for Shannon and other region airports is not forthcoming. ""There's a danger that Ireland will turn into a one-airport state.""

As she is about to drive away, a well-dressed young man gestures to her in the distance, as though needing something. A Her normal response would be to stop and respond - as a woman, she is conditioned to be helpful and polite. But her stomach clenches - something feels wrong. Overriding normal behaviour, she drives away at speed, unsure what is propelling her. She later learns that the same young man tried to abduct another woman at knife-point that same afternoon at the same station. Her gut instinct - her 'supersense' - saved her. Psychologist Steve Biddulph says that before we began to fully understand neuroscience, the doctor's response - what he terms her supersense - would have been called intuition or a sixth sense, but it's neither. Supersense, he says, is our advanced brain capacity ""to integrate sensory information at lightning speed, then run this past the accumulated memory of your whole lifetime, to see if it rings a bell. It lets you know what you need to be aware of. It triggers bodily changes strong enough to alert you - again, faster than words - that this is urgent"". The doctor listened to her body's danger signals - her clenching stomach - and lived to tell the tale. Biddulph shares another story, this time involving a Vietnam War veteran, now living a peaceful civilian life before one day becoming unexpectedly anxious and agitated. Initially unable to figure out why, he connects his internal disturbance with a new family moving into his street. They are Vietnamese. So the veteran goes to their house, introduces himself and offers a neighbourly welcome. Once he had done this, his mood once again stabilises and anxiety dissipates. ""He was reassuring his own amygdala,"" Biddulph says. The amygdala is that ancient part of the brain which regulates emotions and encodes memories. The former combat veteran's amygdala was overriding his prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved in conscious verbal thinking, even though the danger perceived was not real. Encoded memory was freaking him out, until he realised it and addressed it. Biddulph would like us all to come to our senses and not just to avoid knifewielding psychopaths at train stations or unfounded fears of new neighbours. The therapist, author and educator, best known for parenting books like Raising Boys, has just published Fully Human: A New Way of Using Your Mind, in which he combines neuroscience, psychotherapy and decades of his own experience to present two ideas. The first is supersense. The second is the four storey mansion, Biddulph's metaphor for navigating the Psychologist has published mind on four levels - physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual. He urges us to reinhabit and radically reintegrate ourselves with our bodies, rather than being cut off from ourselves, so we use all the inner sensory information at our disposal instead of regarding our bodies as mobile meat scaffolding, there solely to carry our brains around. Brain and mind are not the same thing. Mind is found in the body as well. ""We've been misusing our minds for hundreds of years, and it all comes down to not being tuned in,"" he tells me from his rural home in Tasmania. ""We can't get tuned into ourselves by using our heads. We mistake our brain for our mind - we are living in a tiny part of our brain the thickness of an orange rind [the prefrontal cortex], yet our mind occupies our entire body, via the skin, the organs, the vagus nerve. ""Over generations, we have been taught not to listen to our bodies, to mute out anything individualistic or emotive. People in tune with themselves are far more difficult to govern."" However, as with the Vietnam veteran, the messages from the body are not always accurate. ""It's important to stress that our gut feelings are not always correct - sometimes we can be responding to old baggage."" Your alarm system, he says, can be contaminated by past experiences. There is a whole chapter devoted to trauma, PTSD and, most significantly, post-traumatic growth - Biddulph says that 'going back to normal' after traumatic events is a wasted opportunity. Instead, we can harness what we have learned from trauma so we become more fully integrated and therefore more compassionate and empathic towards others. In other words, more fully human. Biddulph new book People whom Biddulph describes as fully human have three distinct qualities - they are grounded, unhurried and focused. They take themselves and their life problems lightly, yet are fierce about things that matter, and they are generally non-conformist, ""true to themselves and don't simply dance to society's crazy tune"". This integration is when ""heart, head and spirit are going in the same direction"", a state of neurological ""aliveness"" that is available to us all - we just have to tap into it. Which is where the four storey mansion comes in. We don't necessarily need to practise yoga or tai chi or other body work in order to hear what our bodies are telling us, but to simply slow down and ""tune in into our midline"" as he puts it, listening and naming what we feel - clenching, churning, niggling, hollowness, whatever. ""If you don't practise going inside yourself, pretty soon you forget you even have an inside,"" he says. ""Two things tend to go wrong - we get stuck in our heads, which tends to be a man thing, where we think, think, think, which doesn't solve anything other than maybe fixing a car or a computer,"" he says. ""Or we get stuck in our feelings, so that we emote, emote, emote. ""When this happens, we need to go upstairs to the third floor of our mansion where the thinking happens. Such mobility is freeing."" Biddulph is not your typical personal development author. Like Greta Thunberg, he has Asperger's and is never afraid to speak truth to power around areas of masculinity, environmentalism, parenting. There is a whole separate chapter in the book addressing men, but no equivalent chapter for women. ""I'd say 99pc of self-help books are about fitting into the world,"" he says. ""But people with Asperger's have no herd instinct. What I do is confirm people's deep down suspicions, things they already know. I urge people to question how they really are. ""Numbing is disastrous for growth. We need to get back in touch with ourselves, to rewild ourselves. We are wild creatures. We need natural environments."" His interpretation of spirituality is broad and refreshingly inclusive, involving rather more than the usual staring into a candle trying to force ourselves to meditate. ""Surfing, skateboarding, riding mountain bikes, getting drunk, working really hard on a hobby or project, going to music festivals or rock concerts, going to church, making love, using drugs, joining a meditation class or retreat, hiking, swimming naked, going to a football match, dancing, playing an exciting computer game, making music, making art, committing to a long-term relationship, having one brief, intense night of love, having and raising a family..."" All of these, he says, are spiritual pursuits. They are things we do to make ourselves feel connected to something bigger. They are about merging ourselves. Obviously, he is not advocating regular self-medicating via booze or drugs, but recognises that the human urge for merged consciousness can be achieved in all kinds of ways, including fast-track artificial means. This feeling of being merged, rather than separate, is key to our physical and mental health. It is what makes us human. Biddulph, born in Yorkshire in the 1950s before moving to Australia as a child, is retired now, but still writing. His sense of urgency is palpable - in order to tackle climate change, we need to tackle ourselves. He begs us to self examine. ""Are your feelings at odds with your actions? How lined up is your life with who you really are?"" he asks. For decades, he has identified traumatised, emotionally numb masculinity as a root problem, as well as the ""tin man tyrants"" who govern us. ""I tend to take on really big things,"" he says. ""I've tried to change Western masculinity, government policy on climate change and refugees, and now this book is trying to change mental health. These are big aims and I am running out of time."" Not to sound pessimistic, but we all are. Graphic   Psychologist Steve Biddulph has published a new bookSteve Biddulph says we have been misusing our minds for hundreds of years"

And even more so after the Italian goalkeeper's penalty shootout heroics at Wembley to clinch the European Championship trophy at England's expense on Sunday. The former AC Milan ace saved the decisive spot kick from Bukayo Saka to ensure football's 'coming to Rome', rather than 'coming home'. Mannus - whose own penalty save in Slovakia last week just about keeps Shamrock Rovers in the Champions League hunt tonight - faced Donnarumma last summer. The pair were at opposite ends of the pitch when Shamrock Rovers went down swinging in a 2-0 Europa League defeat to AC Milan in Tallaght. And Mannus has nothing but admiration for the rising Italian star, 22, who was also crowned Player of the Tournament at Euro 2020 for good measure. ""I got his top after the game last year,"" said Mannus ahead of tonight's Champions League rescue mission against Slovan Bratislava.

Mannus continued: ""I was messaging a friend on Sunday night when the final went to penalties. ""He asked: 'what do you think?' and I said 'I think they'll save two penalties each'. Just because Donnarumma for who is. ""And Pickford, for all the criticism some of the English people and media put on him, he's got a mentality of wanting to prove to everyone he can play at the highest level. ""He's done really well for England. I still thought he'd save at least two of the five. I thought the save onto the post was brilliant. ""The two of them were excellent all tournament.

I And so, from Wembley stadium to Italian homes, from the big screens in the piazze, to social-media feeds, the radio, the papers, it was all about fever, 'delirium'. And the night and the adventure were all about Chiellini - Giorgio Chiellini, the Italy captain - who, with Leonardo Bonucci and Salvatore Sirigu were the big-brother trio in this young Euro-champions team. ""Can I take it?"" Chiellini asks about the trophy, signifying the fun, joy, brotherhood, humility that have defined the Italian journey from the under-20s, to the clubs, to the team chef bringing his own pizza oven to their camp from Naples, right to Insigne, Lorenzo Il Magnifico, with his devastating goals and less-than devastating DJing. And to Chiesa, a country's invocation now, more than a name. Post-match he's caught instructing his phone, ""Chiama Mamma"". Call Mom. Florenzi holds his medal up to the TV camera. ""Guarda Mamma. Guarda Qua"". ""Look at this, Mom"". It was definitely coming home. First match, cardiac TV commentators roared ""Italians, hang out your flags for Italy, like at the start of the pandemic"". And they did. Washed and ironed, the tricolore fluttered the length of the peninsula and on every Italian balcony and in every Italian window, in every part of the world, supporting a team who ""got it"". They got that nobody, including the Italian mother on social media who asked her daughter if the man in pink was Them, needed to know anything about dribbling or shooting or marking or offside or aggregate goals. Because this championship was first and last about Tenderness. Capital T. Every day, at the national-team home in Florence, Sirigu sent his motivational message to the group-chat, making the players ""with tears in our eyes, want to shatter the world"". If Matteo Pessina (24) quits football, he can turn to writing; his Caro Diario/Dear Diary travelogue one of the hits of the tournament, revealing the unexpected cosa, the 'what' and the 'how', of this Italian team. In the end, their mission, and they accepted it, was not football alone. Rather, it was to take the trauma of 60 million Italians and transform it. These young fellas were no longer players but healers. Roberto Mancini, no longer manager, but Italy's alchemist-in-chief. Saturday morning, I call my Italian friend. All set for tomorrow? ""Si, certo. Barbecue in the afternoon. Then sedation. First, I will do my husband, my father, then my children. And probably the dog. He's a wreck."" That morning, even the grass, the trees, the mists, the monuments, the rivers are alert to the moment. Everyone is in their Savoy blue, bars blasting the music of i grandi italiani, Vivaldi, Verdi, Morricone, Raffaella Carra fresh from her state funeral in Rome. In the sun, the waitress's black latex gloves - usually redolent of murder - are goalie gloves. Everybody is advertising It, waiting for It. Nobody is talking about It. Instead, iron is touched. A lot. Index fingers and pinkies are flicked in a horn-sign at the ground. Twenty-four hours to go. ""Shhh. Don't jinx it. You never know who/what might hear"". Maneskin singing their hearts out, crying their waterproof eyeliner out to win the Eurovision, was a warning and a prophecy. Zitti e buoni. Shut up, be good. Saturday afternoon, there's a crash on the street. A cyclist is killed outright, a motorcyclist critically injured, their plans for the Euro final obliterated in an instant. It's lost on nobody in the vicinity that if they'd left home two seconds sooner, or walked infinitesimally faster or hadn't stopped to take a call, they, too, would have been right there, right at that moment. With Covid, Italians more than any other Europeans know, we live not only our own life, but the life of our times. But equally, as human beings, all of us live as part of humanity in its continuum. Perhaps I'm reading too much into the Rinascimento Azzurri, the Azzurri Renaissance, but there's the sense that, tempered by the virus fire, they are acutely and newly aware that we must find a way to live, better, 'truer', lightly but deeply. Indeed, Pessina's diary reveals them as believing in and belonging to the Dream. The video to Notti Magiche/Magical Nights, the anthem of Italia 90 and now Italia 2021, in conjuring past, present, future and the sense we are living them not linearly, but simultaneously, is both comforting and unnerving. Though our personal dreams might have faded, the Dream itself does not die. As we swap the Covid crisis for the climate crisis, the healers and the alchemists and the keepers of the Dream will have their work cut out. Up here we could lose the Gulf Stream. Rome is set to become as hot as Riyadh. On Sunday night as the Italian papers declared Europe is Ours, Chiellini posted a message to those whom the virus had ""brought to its knees""; to ""the men, women, children… the doctors, nurses who saved our lives, you helped us, you sang with us"". ""Thank you all of you. Because in this incredible adventure we carried you inside us. You were before our eyes, you were in our hearts, your desire to come back to life."" Before the final, Pessina wrote Caro Diario, ""on Sunday the final act of this splendid cavalcade will play out. I'd like to tell you we're happy with however this goes. But these Euros have taught me that in life, dreaming is important and my dream is to win."" From virus fever to victory delirium, Caro Pessina, Caro Chiellini, Cari Azzurri, you did.

As finance ministers huddle in Venice from Friday to hammer out terms on the historic tax deal endorsed by 130 countries last week, Ireland faces a shock that could propel its debt to GNI* ratio nine percentage points higher and hurt the kind of new investment flows needed to sustain our economic growth model. Beyond the heads of agreement on a minimum 15pc tax on corporate profits and giving countries the right to tax big companies where they make their sales, there is still much to play for. There are many still backing a move to a 20pc minimum rate, which would be much worse for State finances, and there are also carveouts to be secured - Britain won one for finance that will cut the profits available to be divvied up by one half, while there are also exemptions for extractive industries and shipping, as well as for firms investing in plant and machinery. It is not just the potential budget losses from this deal - which run from (EURO)800m-(EURO)2bn in Department of Finance estimates - but Ireland also fears ceding ground to the European Commission over taxing rights where states currently have a veto. The raw numbers are scary enough - Oxford Economics says the ratio of Ireland's debt relative to the size of the real economy, a measure known as GNI*, could surge to 120pc. That's before we get to any growth shock from slower investment, or even disinvestment by multinationals as a result of the tax changes. It is also hard to not see the deal agreed at the OECD as the thin edge of a wedge that will establish the principle of rolling reforms to the international tax system. Ireland has most leverage over this process at a European level as the Commission wants to introduce the global minimum tax using EU laws so as to reduce the chance of any member state challenging national laws that would seek to prohibit tax competition. An EU law would require unanimity and three states - Ireland and Hungary, plus Estonia - is a powerful block. The Commission sees the OECD as a wedge to erode vetoes and although references to digital taxes have been muted in the push for a global deal, they are still very much on the table for Brussels which also wants to examine how multinational profits are shared at the EU level and to allocate taxing rights within the bloc. The Commission estimates that profit-shifting costs European tax authorities (EURO)30bn-(EURO)70bn a year and that 80pc is shifted to havens like Luxembourg and Ireland. While the multinational mantra from the likes of Facebook, Apple and Microsoft is that they pay their fair share of taxes under the law and, in the words of Facebook's Nick Clegg ""welcome the important progress"" made at the OECD even if that ""could mean Facebook paying more tax"", they are certainly not prepared to write a blank cheque to Europe's indebted treasuries or to see the rules of the game change at the whim of the European Commission. Even if the Ireland does end up raising the 12.5pc tax rate to 15pc, it will have said no to rolling tax raids on companies that paid almost (EURO)12bn to State coffers last year and created hundreds of thousands of jobs. Germany, France, Italy and Spain aren't being altruistic and have prioritised their gains over those of poor countries who will get the crumbs from the table.

Already 4-0 up from Thursday's first leg at Oriel Park, the Co Louth men made sure of their advancement with a 52nd minute strike from Michael Duffy ensuring the club's biggest ever aggregate victory in Europe. Vinny Perth's (inset) side never really had to get out of second gear against the Welsh outfit and can now look forward to a meeting against either Levadia Tallinn of Estonia or St Joseph's of Gibraltar in the next round. The result sees them equal Shamrock Rovers' record of 18 European wins. It's also just the second time in the club's history they have kept clean sheets over two legs following on from Riga in 2019. The game itself was a poor affair with Chris Hughes' men showing good early spirit but with a four goal aggregate deficit heading into the game it was no surprise that it resembled a friendly for large periods. The home side started on the front foot and could well have pulled a goal back inside four minutes when a loose pass from Patrick McEleney inside his own penalty area was intercepted by James Davies who was unable to punish the mistake before Andy Boyle cut the chance out. In a half of few chances, Dundalk's best would fall to Daniel Kelly on 40 minutes when Duffy's pull back fell to him but he could only blaze over. McEleney then almost broke the deadlock in spectacular fashion four minutes after the restart when a quick free kick from about 45 yards out caught out Jones only for the goalkeeper's blushes to be spared by the upright. The breakthrough did arrive on 52 minutes when Dundalk broke at pace following a Newtown free kick with Duffy racing from halfway onto Kelly's pass before slotting under Jones. Alessio Abibi was forced to make a few good saves after that to ensure the clean sheet - tipping over a Nick Rushton shot late on before saving at point blank range from Jamie Breese from the resultant corner. Nevertheless it was a comfortable win for Dundalk, who now host either FCI Levadia or St Joseph's at Oriel Park on Thursday July 22nd with the Estonians - who they beat over two legs in 2018 - 3-1 up from the first leg last week.

While nuclear energy is a safe renewable energy source, it is not an economic one. Ireland has a market-based auction system for renewable energy with a fixed strike price of EUR 74 MW/h (£67) in the most recent auction and prices expected to fall in future auctions.  Projects must be completed within 27 months of the auction results. Nuclear power could bite into these auctions. However the most recent UK plant Hinkley Point C was granted a strike price of £92.5 (in 2012 prices) linked to inflation. This is estimated to be about £247 by contract end in 2060s.  Hinkley C is scheduled to be completed 18 years after it was announced in a country with a significant history of nuclear power and experienced regulatory agencies.  Given Ireland's planning issues and lack of regulatory or industry experience, a similar plant in Ireland would require at least as long to construct and similarly extortionate incentives.  Even then, private financing would likely be impossible and would require a full government guarantee.

Mr Costello said he became aware of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) in 2016 when the Green Party was among a wide alliance of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community groups campaigning against it. His concerns centred on provisions for investor protection and an investor courts service and he believed the impact of those means CETA must be put before the Irish people in a referendum. When Ireland previously gave up sovereignty to create international bodies such as the International Criminal Court, it did so only after a referendum, he said. His concern about how Ireland feels legally able to proceed with ratifying CETA without asking the people, who are sovereign, has yet to be answered. The Dublin South Central TD outlined his concerns to Ms Justice Nuala Butler at the opening yesterday of his action concerning the constitutionality of the investor protection rules of CETA. Mr Costello is concerned those involve an unconstitutional transfer of sovereignty and judicial power. If the investor court system is brought into force without being sanctioned by a referendum, that would be contrary to Articles 15 and 34 of the Constitution, he claims. His proceedings, against the Government of Ireland, Ireland and the Attorney General, raise significant constitutional issues concerning the power of the Executive to ratify CETA, as well as issues of EU law raised by the defence. The Government had intended it to be ratified via Dáil motion before Christmas. A vote has yet to be called and CETA is currently being considered by two Oireachtas Committees. The bulk of CETA is a trade treaty designed to reduce tariffs and increase trade between the EU and Canada. The trade element has been provisionally ratified by the EU and Canada, and has been applied since September 2017. Chapter 8 of CETA, the focus of Mr Costello's case, provides for an investor protection and investor tribunal system. If ratified, a code of rules will come into force under which Ireland will be bound by restrictions relating to establishment of investments by Canadian investors here. Mr Costello claims the protections for Canadian investors usurp and supplant the law making function of the legislature and the judicial competence of the Irish courts. His concerns include that there is no limit on the value of compensation which may be awarded under the investor tribunal system and neither the tribunal, nor an appellate tribunal, will be composed of judges appointed under the Irish Constitution. The defendants dispute his claims and plead, inter alia, that ratification is within the scope of the executive power of the State.

Although we haven't quite managed to reach that (EURO)5/kg mark so far this year, reports from across the country last week indicate that factory demand has pushed flat prices for Angus onto (EURO)4.80/kg. The Irish cattle mart is where those who do television stock market reports from Wall Street should go if they want to see what a Bull Run on stock really looks like; and I don't mean bullocks getting out of a pen for a gallop. The trade is on fire and being driven by the fact that feedlots and bigger grass finishers, both here and the North, need a constant supply of replacements. In addition, both Northern and Southern factory agents continue to knock all the colours of the rainbow out of each other when it comes to heavy stock. Those with cattle to sell have not been found wanting in keeping the supplies coming as they cash in on the current bonanza as numbers in many marts last week surged. Michael Harty of Roscrea mart told me he had 800 cattle on offer last week. ""The yard was full,"" he said. ""I have never seen that in July."" Brendan Egan of Castlerea and Thomas Potterton of Delvin both reported a doubling in numbers for the time of year. Ennis also reported very strong numbers, while Maurice Brosnan of Gortatlea told me his entry was up 20pc on the same week last year. Did these extra numbers affect the trade? The poorer quality lighter animal did come under pressure, I was told, a fact that led the overall average price of your 300-399kg steer to fall 5c/kg to (EURO)1.66/kg on our price table. Meanwhile, the 350-399kg slipped 8c/kg overall to (EURO)2.24/kg. What was also noticeable was that a large portion of the increased numbers was made up of forward type stores mainly from 550-650/kgs. Other comments dwelt on the fact that some of these extra stores were ""a bit raw in themselves"". This seems to reflect the fact that the hard spring with its wet and cold weather has left its mark on that stock - particularly in the west - and they are possibly not as far advanced as they should be. That said I don't know the finisher who doesn't love that raw but healthy store, once he's got his growing done. Whether they were raw or not, those extra numbers of 550-650kg forward types did impact the price of your 600kg+ bullock and heifer. On our table there was a fall of 7c/kg or (EURO)42/hd among the better 600kg+ bullocks, leaving their overall average back 2c/kg to (EURO)2.32/kg. Meanwhile the better made heifer at 600kgs slipped 5c/kg to (EURO)2.60/kg, although her overall average price remained unchanged at (EURO)2.38/kg.

So it's not surprise that hair loss can stir up profound feelings for men. While some take a balding head in their stride, for others it is devastating. This is something I've found many women don't appreciate - and it's not helped by the fact that many balding men feel embarrassed and ashamed, so are reluctant to talk to others Men who do try to do something about their hair loss - either through surgical options including hair transplants or by taking medication such as Finasteride which, in some men, can slow the rate of balding - are mocked for being vain in a way that would never be acceptable if it were women. So profound is the trauma for some, that a group of experts last week suggested they should be offered counselling to come to terms with it. It's easy to scoff at such a suggestion but, over the years, many men have confided in me that their hair loss either triggered or exacerbated mental health problems. GOING bald is bound up with a loss of masculinity, in a way that the menopause can be linked to a loss of femininity for women. The image of the fat, balding man strikes horror into many young men who find that they are thinning on top. But there's more to it than simply being laughed at. Hair loss can result in a variety of psychological and emotional problems associated with how we perceive ourselves and how we think others view us. There is a sense of powerlessness and impotence; our bodies out of control. During my career as a psychiatrist, I have seen many men who have become clinically depressed after starting to lose their hair and several who have tried to kill themselves because it has made them feel so low and desperate. Yet still we struggle to properly recognise the impact this can have on a man's life. Women are now good at openly talking about the menopause, supporting one another and discussing their difficulties. But men still bottle up their feelings and can struggle to talk about this openly. Sh the be given incentives It sounds what health are planning. was it's unfair, makes sense. costs the billions a comes at a than The result is it remains hidden and unacknowledged. Before the pandemic, I went for a drink with a friend of mine who is a builder. He earns a modest amount, but was telling me how he had been doing extra shifts to save up some money. 'What for?' I asked, assuming he would say something like a deposit for a flat. 'For a hair transplant,' he replied. I was amazed. I've known him for years and I don't think he's ever spoken to me about his appearance before. Sure, he's thinning on top, but it never occurred to me that he was worried about it, certainly not to the extent of putting by (EURO)15,000 for transplant surgery.

Tackling it smaller price treating the obese. This admission that he was so upset about his thinning hair was clearly a massive step for him and, I suspect, he only told me because he knows I work in mental health. When I suggested he talk to his girlfriend about it, his eyes widened and he shook his head. 'I'd die of embarrassment,' he told me. Of course, many men are able to embrace their thinning hair. They accept it as part of life and opt for a closely shaved look. But, even then, it's interesting that there's a whole emerging market for men who don't want to appear to be going bald despite shaving their head. You can now opt to have stubble tattooed on to your head to give the impression of a full hair line. This is increasingly popular and can look convincing. AFRIEND of mine had it done a few years ago and his wife, whom he met after the procedure, still doesn't know that what she thinks is stubble on his head is in fact a clever tattoo. But all this is going on in the shadows. Men don't feel able to talk about the distress they feel when they start losing their hair because they think it makes them seem weak and unmanly. The trauma they experience is real and I think many of these men - regardless of whether they decide to have a hair transplant, or Finasteride or whatever - would benefit from talking to someone to help them come to terms with this natural ageing www.process.No intervention - surgical or pharmacological - is perfect and nothing offers a total solution to hair loss.

In globalised economies, headline growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), has become increasingly dislodged from everyday activity, not least because of intangible assets such as intellectual property patents, which confer value often without the associated underlying activity you'd expect. The latter drove a 25 per cent jump in Irish GDP in 2015, the sharpest on record, triggering the ""leprechaun economics"" jibe. The commission said the euro-zone economy would grow faster than previously thought both this year and next, despite emerging concerns about the fast-spreading Delta variant. Within this, it upped its growth forecast for the Irish economy to 7.2 per cent from 4.6 per cent previously.  The better-than-expected outlook for Ireland comes on the back of the vaccine rollout and the likely jump in domestic demand with the easing of restrictions. It also comes in the wake of the Central Bank's 8.2 per cent forecast for growth this year and the Economic and Social Research Institute's 11 per cent forecast. It's hard to understand how these bumper forecasts can reside alongside such an elevated level of unemployment, currently put at 18 per cent but expected to remain high for the rest of the year and for several years to come.  The OECD warned Ireland's recovery - in terms of employment - may take until 2024 and would be one of the slowest rebounds of any developed country."

The Red Hands had the unenviable task of facing defending champions Dublin at Kingspan Breffni in their Group Three clash, but they showed no fear and indeed had the holders rocking early on but Dublin’s class shone through to win 2-18 to 1-11. Chloe McCaffrey’s 13th minute goal had them stunned, but the water break saw Dublin regroup and a strong finish to the half saw them take control with Jennifer Dunne and Siobhan Killeen grabbing majors to put them 2-8 to 1-8 ahead at the break. Dublin dominated the third quarter as Tyrone failed to register a score, finally getting the first point of the second half after 47 minutes through Niamh Hughes with Niamh O’Neill, who finished with nine points, adding another two. In Group One, Mayo joined Armagh at the top of the table with a 1-18 to 0-15 victory over Cavan at Markievicz Park. The Westerners laid the foundation for the victory with a strong second quarter as they outscored Gerry Moane’s side 1-4 to 0-2 to build up a seven-point interval break, 1-9 to 0-5, Rachel Kearns scoring the goal on 24 minutes. The early exchanges were tight with just two points separating the sides at the first water break as Mayo led 0-5 to 0-3. They were able to keep this advantage and the Breffni girls at arm’s length in the second half to run out deserved winners despite Cavan substitute Amy Rooney’s six points. Elsewhere, Cork held off a brave challenge from senior newcomers Meath to win 1-9 to 0-10, with Brid O’Sullivan’s goal just before half-time proving crucial. Galway held on for a 2-11 to 2-10 win over Kerry on Friday evening in the first game of the championship. THERE were mixed fortunes for Ulster’s two intermediate championship sides. Down who are in the driving seat in Group Four after a 3-14 to 2-14 win over Offaly, while Fermanagh saw a seven-point lead crumble as they lost 1-12 to 1-11 to Leitrim. The Mourne county turned in a superb performance in Lannleire on Sunday with Natasha Ferris central to their victory, in which she scored 2-1 in the space of 60 seconds. The Faithful county started the brighter and had built up a six-point advantage but at the break that was cut to the minimum. They took control again on the resumption with five unanswered points but that 2-1 from Ferris turned the game on its head. It was end-to-end after that and Kate McKay pulled off a super save to keep Offaly at bay before, with the sides level, Ferris struck over three unanswered points to give Down victory. Fermanagh goalkeeper Shauna Murphy saved a penalty in each half but it wasn’t enough as the Erne county saw lost by the minimum in Ballinamore. They had led at the break 1-8 to 0-5, with Aoife Flanagan netting the goal with the last action of the half when she collected a stunning pass from Eimear Smyth before firing to the net. Laura O’Dowd gave Leitrim a lifeline when she goaled to leave four between them, 1-10 to 1-6, and it was the catalyst they needed with Fermanagh managing just one more point in the final eight or so minutes. In the junior championship, Derry recorded their first win in over two years when a Ciara McGurk goal helped them to a 1-7 to 0-7 win over neighbours Antrim at Corrigan Park. The sides were level at 0-3 apiece at the break but the Oak Leafers took control on the resumption to record the victory."

It means McGregor, 32, has now won just one fight since Barack Obama was US President, as was pointed out by a reporter last week. The former champ-champ is still a massive draw in the States, with Donald Trump among the many VIPs who were in attendence. And of course the former plumber will have the last laugh as he is set to trouser a reported $20million for his efforts. McGregor resurfaced on social media yesterday and compared himself to Scarface villain Tony Montana in a Facebook post. But make no mistake about it, his MMA career is in serious doubt after this defeat. His post-fight rant about Poirier's wife was undignified and should not distract from this latest heavy loss. While McGregor is undoubtedly still a massive draw, his stock has taken a battering and it remains to be seen if he can compete at the highest level.

Shades of the 1990s on a dull July Sunday. After a series of alarmingly one-sided games throughout the country, the football season was revived by the tangy rivalry in the northwest.  The GAA - and RTÉ - must have thanked their stars even as Patrick McBrearty sent a left-foot winner spiralling into the grubby sky. Seventy-five minutes gone; nerves frayed, Derry tantalisingly close to their biggest win in a decade, Michael Murphy's late introduction when Donegal were on the brink: it was a game choc-a-bloc with talking points after a 0-16 to 0-15 win for Donegal. There were many excellent on-field performances for Derry but this game was shaped by Rory Gallagher, the former Donegal manager, who micromanaged his team through with terse instructions as the game deepened into a tense and absorbing contest.  It was a brilliant performance from Derry and the manner of the loss was sickening for them. But as Gallagher stood on the empty field he cast an eye over the Donegal substitutes going through a series of drills on the passing field and his eye fell on a former All-Ireland winner. ""The gulf from Division One to Division Three is massive, but the gulf from us to Division One isn't that big,"" he said. ""We don't get everything right but I'm not stupid, I know good footballers, it was a matter of us gelling. There's an awful lot of experience about tactics but team spirit, togetherness, playing for the cause - I see boys doing the warm-down there, I know them inside out. ""Paddy McGrath there, 32, won't sulk, will get on with it. That's what we need to do. We need to learn an awful lot. I would be passing on some of the experience I have from Donegal, the way they always put the team first. Even today when it wasn't going their way they stuck at it and dug it out."" That was true. The cases for and against Donegal as real deal contenders can both be persuasively made. But they carry on. The limited minutes of the talismanic Murphy remains a concern as they prepare for Tyrone next Sunday in Enniskillen. They are developing the iffy habit of digging holes for themselves in order to climb back out. ""We were nine down against Monaghan and came back,"" said Declan Bonner. ""The lads showed great character. I don't want to make a habit of it to be honest! But I think the substitutions probably worked well for us and getting the right man on the ball in terms of Patrick McBrearty.  ""I thought we saw the game out . . .

Speaking to The Irish Times in Derry at the end of his three-day trip to the North, Mr Starmer said Anglo-Irish relations were at an ""all-time low"". He said a proposed amnesty for Troubles-era killings as ""wrong"" and urged practical solutions to make the Northern Ireland protocol work.  He called on British prime minister Boris Johnson to directly intervene to ""de-escalate disorder"" during the coming days as tensions simmer over post-Brexit arrangements going into the height of the loyalist marching season.  Mr Starmer put himself at odds with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar's recent remarks that he could see the reunification of Ireland within his lifetime.  ""Obviously there is more discussion now about a border poll than there was some years ago,"" he said.  ""I think it is not in sight, frankly, and the obvious priority at the moment, particularly coming out of the pandemic, is the economy, health and education and longer term issues.  ""These are very important priorities and I think a border poll is not in sight. It is not in sight as far as I am concerned."" During his visit, Mr Starmer met leaders of the five political parties in the Stormont Executive and had dinner on Thursday night in Derry with SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.  'Loss of trust' It was a ""striking feature"" of his discussions that there has been a ""loss of trust"" in the British government over the ongoing negotiations between London and Brussels regarding the implementation of the protocol, he said.  ""The prime minister negotiated the protocol, he knew what he was doing,"" said Mr Starmer. ""He mis-sold it and now he is not taking responsibility for making it work."" An EU-UK deal on veterinary standards to cut checks on goods moving between Britain and the North would be a ""good starting point"" in attempts to make the protocol work, he added.  ""I am worried on the back of the discussions I've had over the last three days that progress appears to be stalling,"" he said. ""A lot of that is down to the loss of trust in the prime minister as an honest broker in this."" Referring to remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney that London has shown no ""generosity"" in talks to break the impasse, Mr Starmer suggested there is a ""a lack of trust and confidence"" in Mr Johnson in Dublin and Brussels.  ""When across the board, that trust and confidence is being burnt through, you have got a real problem for the United Kingdom on the international stage,"" he said.  ""Frankly, if you start discussions and your approach by threatening to breach international law, you send completely the wrong message to partners about how you are going to operate either the protocol or any part of your international obligations."" On Anglo-Irish relations, he said he feared they were at all-time low.  ""This is a close partnership with a very important country, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned, with a shared history and a shared future, but I fear they are at an alltime low and responsibility lies at the door of Number 10 [Downing Street]."" Victims  Mr Starmer also met representatives of Wave, the North's largest cross-community organisation supporting victims of the Troubles.  Last week, the organisation warned Mr Johnson that a blanket amnesty for conflict-linked prosecutions would be ""fundamentally wrong"" and would deepen the anguish and bitterness suffered by survivors.  ""It is very clear that their pain and suffering is ongoing,"" said Mr Starmer of the victims. ""It lives with them, with their children, their siblings and with those that themselves were injured.  ""The idea that somebody could sit in Westminster and talk about drawing a line on their pain without even engaging with them about how we find a way forward is something that they feel is deeply disrespectful. ""I strongly believe if we are to find a way forward then the starting point for the prime minister and the secretary of state [for Northern Ireland] is to have discussions with those most affected and that is those that are the victims or the families of the victims of the violence of the Troubles. ""That is where the discussion starts, it doesn't start in Westminster with a manifesto commitment."" Mr Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions for England and Wales , said ""I firmly believe in the rule of law.""  ""Therefore I think a blanket amnesty is wrong and I don't detect any support for that in Northern Ireland,"" he added. On loyalist tensions over the protocol, Mr Starmer said he was concerned about ""what appears to be a pretty fragile situation at the moment, particularly going into what is very often a difficult week in Northern Ireland.""  ""All political leaders including the prime minister should do what they can to de-escalate disorder in the coming days,"" he said. "

At least six people have been killed and hundreds arrested in recent days. Police struggled to contain rising violence in cities including Durban and Johannesburg yesterday after a weekend of looting and riots.  Protesters have blocked main roads and trucks have been burnt. The deployment will ""provide safety and a safe working environment for members of the [police] and other law enforcement agencies whilst they carry out their constitutionally mandated law and order duties"", South Africa's defence forces said in a statement yesterday.  Troops were used to enforce the first coronavirus lockdown but it is rare for them to be deployed in response to unrest.  It is not clear how many troops will be sent to the hardest-hit provinces of Gauteng, the nation's economic hub, and KwaZulu-Natal, where Zuma began his sentence on Thursday. Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in prison after defying an inquiry into corruption during his nine-year rule. Zuma's lawyers made a last-ditch attempt yesterday to persuade the constitutional court to rescind its sentence on the grounds that the 79-year-old is too weak to survive prison. Legal experts say the attempt is unlikely to succeed. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Zuma in 2018 and has sought to battle endemic corruption, on Sunday condemned the ""sporadic but increasingly violent protests"".  Mr Ramaphosa promised ""we will not tolerate acts of criminality"" but rioting continued overnight.  ""While there are those who may be hurt and angry at this moment, there can never be any justification for such violent, destructive and disruptive actions,"" Mr Ramaphosa said on Sunday. Corruption claims Zuma was imprisoned on the orders of South Africa's constitutional court, which last month found him guilty of defiance over his refusal to answer to claims of systematic corruption during his presidency.  The sentence was hailed as a victory for the rule of law in Africa's most industrial nation, after Zuma repeatedly attacked courts and predicted a popular uprising against judges.  Zuma denies all wrongdoing. The violence and anger of his supporters has exposed tensions in the ruling African National Congress, with many looters invoking Zuma's name in footage online. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021"

Asked about anonymous reports that Ms O'Connell would be blocked if she were to attempt a return at the next general election, and asked if he would make the position clear, Mr Varadkar said: ""As you know, Kate O'Connell won a seat in the Dáil in 2016 with a huge support from the [Fine Gael] party at the time. ""Unfortunately she wasn't able to hold her seat in the 2020 election. She chose not to put her name forward for the by-election selection convention. I've been elected four times now to the Dáil, and I had to go to selection convention too, and I still do, and I'm the party leader. ""You know, nobody should think that they're entitled to be on a ticket or to get a nomination. Everyone in our party has to go before party members and make their case, and that will apply to everyone."" Asked by the Irish Independent if he thought Ms O'Connell had ducked an opportunity to run in the by-election because it was always going to be hard for Fine Gael to hold the Eoghan Murphy seat, Mr Varadkar responded: ""I can't answer that. I don't speak for other people. What I can say is that I think the analysis at the outset that somehow this seat was ours to lose, or was in the bag, was always a flawed one. ""A by-election is very differ- ent [to a general election], you need 50pc [instead of 20pc], and you need to be getting the transfers to do that. A major source of our transfers would be Fianna Fáil. So it was always going to be hard to hold the seat. ""I think James Geoghegan, as a first-time candidate, getting 26pc of the vote was a really good result for him. ""He'll have an opportunity to go forward again and I think to do even better next time. I predict that next time he'll be the poll topper."" Meanwhile, the Tánaiste said there would be no change to income tax rates or the Universal Social Charge (USC) in the next Budget. This is because of our ""big national debt"", Mr Varadkar said at the launch of positive IDA mid-year results on foreign direct investment. But he did say the Government would be widening the tax bands, to prevent ""stealth taxes"" increasing the tax take from individuals as their wages increase. ""We need to create spending in crucial areas like housing,"" he said of the need to have adequate fiscal space. ""What it does mean is that we'll honour our commitment, contained in the Programme for Government, that we will index tax bands. On global tax, and pressure on Ireland to sign up to a 15pc corporate tax rate after agreement between 130 countries, with this country one of nine hold-out states, Mr Varadkar said the national interest would be fought for. ""This stable low corporation tax regime we have of 12.5pc has worked for Ireland,"" Mr Varadkar said. ""Secondly, we shouldn't be under any illusions about what is going on here. This isn't just about tax justice and big companies paying their fair share of taxes, although it is about that. ""This is also about big countries trying to get a bigger share of the pie.""

WDAI has teamed up with Dublin-based charity Lámh Fáilte and is cooking venison burgers for homeless people at a stand located off O'Connell Street each Saturday evening. The venison is supplied by WDAI members and the burgers are manufactured by Premier Game, a registered game processor based in south Tipperary. The initiative comes as problems with deer have escalated across the east and north-west of the country over the last 18 months. The ICMSA and INHFA have reported serious difficulties with deer in Wicklow, Donegal and Connemara, with big numbers coming onto agricultural land as traditional culling has been curtailed due to Covid-19. Demand for venison has also slumped as a result of the lockdowns and the closure of restaurants. Ger O'Brien of WDAI said that the association had been in contact with farmers in Donegal where increased deer numbers are causing serious concerns. Flagged The INHFA has flagged this problem, with the association claiming that bigger numbers of breeding stock in national parks and forestry in the northwest and west generally was resulting in greater numbers of deer coming onto farmland. Mr O'Brien said WDAI was in talks with the Donegal farmers about putting a plan in place to manage deer numbers. ""If farmers contact the WDAI about problems with deer, we will initially do a survey with cameras to tell them the sort of numbers that are there,"" Mr O'Brien explained. ""We will then put a management team in place to cull the deer herd on an ongoing basis,"" he added. He said WDAI, which has around 350 members nationally, has been in contact with deer stalkers in the north-west with a view to putting a ""team on the ground"" in Donegal. Mr O'Brien insisted that a planned and sustained culling programme was needed to address the difficulties associated with the growing deer population. ""Recreational deer stalkers won't do the job for you. They won't shoot sufficient numbers, and they won't take out the hinds [females]. And any cull must target the hinds,"" Mr O'Brien said. ""We want to see a sustainable number of deer on the ground. But we don't want to see deer as a problem,"" he said.

The unrest had mainly been concentrated in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), where he started serving a 15-month sentence for contempt of court on Wednesday night. Mr Zuma's sentencing and subsequent imprisonment have been seen as a test of the post-apartheid nation's ability to enforce the law fairly - even against powerful politicians - 27 years after the African National Congress (ANC) ousted the white minority rulers to usher in democracy. But his incarceration has angered Mr Zuma's supporters and exposed rifts within the ANC. Police said criminals were taking advantage of the anger to steal and cause damage. National intelligence body NatJoints warned that those inciting violence could face criminal charges. NatJoints said in a statement that 62 people had been arrested in KZN and Gauteng, the province where Johannesburg is located, since the violence began. The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department said there had been looting in the Alexandra township and Jeppestown suburb on Saturday night. The M2 was closed off after there were reports of shots being fired at passing vehicles. Alcohol ban A  column of protesters brandished sticks, golf clubs and branches as they whistled and marched through Johannesburg's central business district, where off-licences had been burgled and shop windows smashed. The sale of alcohol is currently banned under lockdown restrictions designed to ease pressure on hospitals during a severe third wave of Covid-19 infections. KZN police spokesman Jay Naicker said there had also been more looting in eThekwini, the municipality that includes Durban. ""We saw a lot of criminals or opportunistic individuals trying to enrich themselves during this period,"" he said. Mr Zuma was given the jail term for defying an order from the constitutional court to give evidence at an inquiry that is investigating high-level corruption during his nine years in power until 2018. He denies there was widespread corruption under his leadership but has refused to co-operate with the inquiry, which was set up in his final weeks in office. Mr Zuma has challenged his sentence in the constitutional court, partly on the grounds of his alleged frail health and the risk of catching Covid-19. That challenge is due to be heard today. Parliament's presiding officers said yesterday that they were ""sympathetic to the personal difficulties confronting former president Jacob Zuma.

Everseen launched its legal action against Walmart earlier this year, claiming the retailer had misappropriated the Irish firm's technology and then built its own product that's similar to Everseen's. The Cork company's technology helps retailers to reduce theft at the point of sale in stores. It says it can save individual stores up to hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The technology enables retailers to transition away from traditional manned registers, ""unlocking a staggering return on investment"", according to Everseen. In its redacted complaint filed in February, Everseen alleged that it installed its technology at Walmart stores between 2015 and 2020. ""Walmart grew unhappy with its increasing reliance on Everseen's technology and began to look for an alternative,"" the Irish company claimed. ""Walmart used Everseen's trade secrets and confidential information to develop what is essentially a Walmart copy of Everseen's CPI (Checkout Process Intelligence) technology,"" the complaint alleges. The Irish firm claimed that Walmart also began to offer that technology to other retailers ""and has begun competing with Everseen for business using technology it developed by misappropriating and misusing Everseen's trade secrets and confidential information"". In new filings, Walmart sought and secured permission from the Arkansas court to file a redacted response to Everseen's complaint, because the Irish company's complaint had also been redacted. ""Everseen contends that filing the complaint under seal was necessary, in part, because the complaint identifies Everseen's trade secrets and confidential information,"" noted lawyers for Walmart. ""Walmart disagrees that the complaint does anything of the sort and will be moving to dismiss… for failure to state a claim,"" they added. ""Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, Walmart requests leave to file its unredacted motion to dismiss and supporting brief under seal."" Everseen has contended that without the technology Walmart developed, the retailer would have had to continue using the Irish firm's product ""to avoid the hundreds of millions of dollars"" of point of sale losses that the technology prevented. Everseen was founded by Alan O'Herlihy, who is its chief executive. The company has claimed that Walmart's alleged conduct will be ""devastating"" for the Irish firm ""if left unchecked"". Everseen's backers include high-profile investors such as Carl McCann and Cyril McGuire. Other investors in the firm include Irish Continental ferry group CEO Eamonn Rothwell, Tayto Park owner Ray Coyle, and former Fexco director Pa Nolan.

While the debate around climate change has centred on the need to cut carbon emissions from agriculture and transport, the failure to frame the national discourse in a wider context and address the restrictions that have locked many farmers out of renewable energy generation has stirred serious resentment. ""Farmers are being continually blamed for contributing to the carbon emissions problem, but we are being excluded from being part of the solution,"" one angry farmer says. Ireland's record on supporting micro-generation of electricity - defined as a grid connection of up to 6kW for single-phase current or 11kW three-phase - has been extremely poor. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) admits that there is no reliable database to record the level of electricity produced by micro-generation in Ireland. But it estimates that there is an installed capacity of 75MW across around 30,000 micro-generators. This represents just 0.14pc of total annual demand for Ireland in 2020. Disappointing The record for on-farm renewable energy generation is equally disappointing. Ireland was ranked 23rd of the EU-27 for renewable energy production from agriculture in 2018, the IFA points out. The farm sector generated just 2.6pc of the country's total energy output, compared with an EU-27 average of 12.1pc. Ireland's renewable energy policy has traditionally favoured multi-million-euro wind energy developments, with major solar projects also starting to come on stream. The farm organisations complain that there has been little consideration at policy level - or in terms of access to the grid - for small-scale developments by private individuals or communities. Pat Smith, of renewable energy company Local Power Ltd, says a different approach at national level is needed. He maintains there is enough suitable roof space on farms and businesses in Ireland to install up to 3,000MW of solar PV that could generate up to (EURO)500m per year of renewable electricity across the country. ""This would help businesses resource their energy costs and earn an income from their roof space, and would provide thousands of sustainable jobs across every community in Ireland,"" he says. ""It would also help the grid in distributing generation across the country rather than in concentrated areas."" Uptake of rooftop solar by Irish farmers has been restricted by the requirement in the Microgeneration Support Scheme that the farm or business must utilise 70pc of the electricity generated, so is restricted to selling just 30pc into the grid. This usage stipulation means that micro-generation on farms makes most economic sense for high energy users such as pig and poultry units, as well as some horticulture enterprises or intensive dairy operations. ""It is disappointing that the lack of ambition for micro-renewables and a claim that there are grid connection issues has prevented tens of thousands of people, businesses and farms benefiting from adopting PV solar technology to generate some of their own electricity and export the surplus to the grid,"" Mr Smith says. He points out that roof-top microrenewables have being rolled out successfully in many other countries and says unnecessary roadblocks to the widespread adoption of the technology need to be removed. Mr Smith says planning is still needed for rooftop solar PV despite repeated commitments from various Energy Ministers and officials that this basic change would be made. A spokesman for DECC told the Farming Independent that a proposed Micro-generation Support Scheme - which was initially promised by July but is now due to be published this year - will broaden the definition of a microgenerator and increase the output limit to 50kW. The Department says a ""suitable"" payment for excess electricity generated by farms and businesses and exported to the grid will be available to all renewable generators in the second half of 2021. Crucially, however, DECC insists that the primary aim of a microgeneration scheme is to enable electricity users to meet their own electricity needs, and that a cap on the level that can be commercially sold onto the grid by businesses such as farms is likely to remain in place. ""The rationale behind a cap of this sort is to encourage new installations that maximise selfconsumption rather than maximise generation for export, as this is the best way of maximising carbon abatement and energy savings for the consumer,"" the DECC spokesman says. ""Further analysis will commence shortly on appropriate payments to encourage larger installations specifically for generation for economic benefit."" This approach has not impressed the farm organisations. They say national policy on renewable energy has favoured projects of scale, which are generally supported by large domestic or international concerns, or state entities such as ESB, Bord na Móna or Coillte. ""Farmers want to be central players in Ireland's energy transition,"" Paul O'Brien of IFA says. ""They recognise the opportunities offered by microgeneration to produce energy for their own use but also to diversify their farm income by selling excess energy to the grid and enhancing the sustainability of their farm business."" He describes the limited focus of the proposed Micro-generation Support Scheme on domestic installations as a ""missed opportunity to support farmers and communities to transition to renewable energy"". ""The self-consumption limit of 70pc must be removed to provide low energy users opportunities to generate and export renewable energy,"" Mr O'Brien says. IFA has also called for the introduction of a capital grant to overcome the high initial investment costs required by renewable projects. ""A major challenge to microgeneration is the grid connection process, which continues to be a deterrent to the delivery of on-farm renewable projects,"" Mr O'Brien says. ""Zero-cost access and use of the grid for micro-generation installations under 50kW microgeneration must be made available to farmer and community energy projects."" ICSA president Dermot Kelleher has accused the Government of endless prevarication on renewables. Instead of making ""bold and ambitious decisions"", Government policy appeared to be ""paralysed by fear"", he says. ""The recent consultation on microgeneration of electricity made it very clear that the Government has little interest in farmers making money from putting solar panels on the roof of a shed,"" he says. Realistic return ""Instead of enabling farmers to get a realistic return on investment by selling at an economic price to the grid, they made it clear that they only wanted farmers to produce what they could use themselves. ""This is not what a transformative renewable energy policy looks like."" Denis Drennan of ICMSA is equally critical of the Government's ""ad-hoc and bitty approach"" to farmscale renewables. ""Years into this conversation about farm-based renewables, we are still talking about aims and ambitions when we should half-way through the actual installations by now,"" he says. ""The Government has to get on with this. It is perfectly possible to have a renewable network that is based at community level and has buy-in from the local communities because of the clean affordable energy it will provide.

Couple that with global vaccination roll-outs and the result is an accelerated pace of economic recovery that is set to continue and broaden in 2022. However, if Covid has taught us anything, it is that life can be pretty unpredictable. Even as Ireland and other economies across the world were preparing for a post-vaccination spending boom, the Delta variant reminds us that we are not always fully in charge. It is a timely reminder at a point when investment sentiment is optimistic to a level that is bordering on euphoria. The reasons for optimism are understandable; a strengthening global economy driven by substantial pentup demand, generally rising household savings and accommodative Central Bank policies, but there is a fine line between optimism and complacency. RECORD GROWTH BUT SOME COMPLACENCY On the one-hand, positive signs abound as economic growth heads for multi-decade highs, companies report strong earnings, and volatility recedes. At the same time, rising input costs and strong demand are fuelling inflation. SSGA's Market Regime Indicator - a proprietary tool to gauge the market environment and investor sentiment - indicates a worrying level of complacency among investors. Shocks can and do occur and those don't need to be of the scale of the ongoing global pandemic to warrant caution. Slower burn issues, such as inflation and rising interest rates are also grounds for a measure of caution. HOUSEHOLDING SPENDING WILL BE KEY The current levels of savings built up in much of the developed world (and even in parts of the developing world) will take time to make its way back through the economy. In Ireland alone, the Central Bank estimated that household deposits increased by (EURO)15.7bn between March 2020 and February 2021 as Covid-19 restrictions curbed spending. A large portion of these savings may be more akin to deferred spending than precautionary savings; this is delayed spending, not lost spending. The final impact of the unwinding of those household savings is yet to be seen. Across the global economy the release of pent-up demand has so far been heavily skewed in favour of tangible goods. During the second half of 2021 and going into 2022, we expect to see a strong swing towards services that should support a fuller, broader, continuing recovery. However, the pace and extent of that recovery may vary significantly. Spending could turn out to be considerably higher if there is a swift recovery from the pandemic. While a slower recovery could encourage households to hold on to the savings for longer. INFLATION - TRANSIENT OR SUSTAINED? While most of the inflation spike at the moment is transient in nature, SSGA suspects that the new normal for inflation over the next two years will be higher than pre-Covid. Here in Ireland, the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) point to inflation running at 1.7pc year on year in May - an acceleration from the depressed impact of the first lockdown. Ireland is not alone in experiencing inflation driven by base effects and pent-up demand. Worldwide this will be one of the major focus points - how enduring and high its trajectory is will determine Central Bank rates and asset purchases with implications for most assets - especially bonds and stocks. OPTIMISM WITH CAUTION At SSGA, our central view for risk assets is arguably the most optimistic we have held in recent years because of the strengthening global economy, pent-up demand and ultra-accommodative central banks. As the growth differential between the United States and Europe starts to narrow and emerging markets continue to make progress against the Covid threat, US market leadership is likely to give way to a more international scope. Strong earnings prospects and less-stretched valuations will continue to add to the appeal of European equities. Against a surging economic backdrop, however, the market is currently treading a fine line between optimism and complacency. Such complacency can potentially leave the market more prone to being rudely awakened by, and overreacting to, potential shocks that can occur - be that the impact of the global pandemic, of geopolitical tensions or the myriad of other possibilities. Markets will also be maintaining a watchful eye on inflation, interest rates and bond yields, to establish whether the current US experiment of letting the economy 'run hot' raises concern over the market's confidence for a smooth exit from one of the biggest monetary policy exercises in history. In summary, we expect the positive economic momentum to continue into 2022 thereby supporting markets. Those markets have admittedly come a long way and now need to continue to deliver solid earnings growth. Investors face a broadly favourable backdrop but also need to keep an eye on some evolving risks.

The first saved in 36 hours as it was a little light; the second required four teddings and yielded 80 bales from 11 acres. We wrapped one field in pink bale wrap, the other in yellow - and the crows paid no heed to the yellow wrap. We bought a tedder this year and it has a valuable tool in ensuring the haylage and silage we produce is top quality. With school holidays in full swing, our three girls are a huge help on the farm, from milking to checking youngstock. Their assistance lets everyone get a break and finish early in the evenings. That is the beauty of family farming - showing the next generation how to safely tackle a job and then working alongside them, often just standing back, admiring how they progress. With second-cut silage now looming, the team effect frees up time for me to mow the crop and have Paula follow me with the tedder, allowing for maximum wilt in a short space of time. As many a minister has explained to me, family farming is a key selling point for Irish produce on the global market. We have witnessed this on numerous occasions when welcoming international guests on farm in pre-Covid times. Most of these visitors have never seen a family embracing farm life together. Seeing the younger generation play roles in the viability of a farm endorses to them what Ireland is as a brand. Family farming is also a selling point to the Irish consumer, particularly during the very public battle with An Taisce. It saddens when I hear people in our sector come out against young family members working on farms. It's ridiculous to put on age restrictions and stop a young ag enthusiast trying their hand at a career that struggles to welcome young people. It is key that we educate the youth on the dangers of farming, instruct them on how to work safely and, most importantly, delegate jobs based on experience as well as age. Many a young person has had to fill a bigger pair of boots when a parent got seriously ill or died; often those farms would otherwise have had to be leased out or even sold. Embracing the next generation will help protect our unique selling point; in the short term we must ensure this tradition survives. Because recent CAP talks made me wonder, are we still a family farming nation or rapidly pushing our industry towards a more commercial sector? Convergence on farm entitlements is a contentious subject. The IFA said CAP reform combined with the Climate Action Bill could ""shut down commercial farming in Ireland"", and there have attempts by some to silence any voices who are vocally pro full convergence. Commanded Land rental prices have commanded record prices for some time, particularly when the land carries high entitlements. Many people have left the farming way of life - look at the amount of dispersal sales over the last few years. Seventeen member states have already completed internal convergence, so why are we so intent on protecting those who gain most from EU subsidies? It has been widely reported that only a third of Irish farms are viable, yet some people seem intent on ensuring any chance of a lifeline is withheld. So have we decided to abandon the two-thirds of farms that aren't viable? Brussells has given Minister McConalogue full control over any chance of redistribution, which will surely mean he has many more days in the hot seat. Full convergence will cost our farm financially but if it means offering a lifeline to Ireland's treasured family farming, then it is a step that needs to be taken. The opportunity is also there to cap the maximum payment any one farmer can receive - and finally remove the need to publish a list of farmers who receive high subsidies. Minister McConalogue has said that 50pc of the country's CAP payments go to just 20pc of farmers; the conundrum for him is whether he offers a seat to smaller Irish farm families on the EU lifeboat or merely refreshes the dish of cream for the fat cats.

The Freight Transport Association Ireland (FTAI) has warned that Ireland's economy will be hit hard by a shortage of skills in haulage. Ms Murphy, who is the former president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, said many drivers are choosing to retire or leaving the job because of the increased red tape associated with Brexit. 'There are many drivers that are retiring because Brexit has made the job very, very difficult. Drivers drive, that is what they do, but when they sit in queues waiting and [dealing with] regulatory departments, it drives them nuts,' she said. 'We're not replacing them. We would need 4,000 drivers in the near future to compensate for those who are retiring or taking other jobs.' The average age of a driver in Ireland is 58, said Ms Murphy. On top of this, there is the issue that many foreign drivers left the country after the Covid pandemic hit and have not come back, along with the fact that people cannot have HGV driving lessons now, due to health restrictions. Ms Murphy said the capacity of the six-month driver training programme needs to be increased and rolled out in every Education and Training Board (ETB). 'Extend the driver training programmes of all the ETBs because at the moment it is too limiting and it is too slow,' she said. 'When young fellows and young girls are looking for something to do, they don't hang around, they get a job and they stick with it.' Ms Murphy added that the issue of the Critical Skills Employment Permits needs to be looked at so drivers can be brought in from more countries to work. Aidan Flynn, general manager at FTAI, said the industry is suffering a shortage of qualified drivers with the pandemic causing a high turnover of driving staff. 'While the freight distribution and logistics sector has kept the nation stocked during the pandemic, not all sectors which use HGV drivers have been operational,' he said. 'Many have either returned to work in eastern Europe or have switched to jobs in other sectors. This is creating unsustainable recruitment problems for a sector on which all areas of our economy relies, and an ever-decreasing pool of workers means that gaps will soon start to appear in our supply chain.' 'To ease the skills shortage, FTA is asking the Government to provide a temporary derogation to attract these drivers back into temporary employment and allow them to drive for hire and reward while they are waiting to refresh their professional driver training qualification - the CPC. 'This would be great help to our members and industry where some employees have full licences, but they do not have an up-todate driver card.' Mr Flynn said that if the skills shortage is not addressed business costs are likely to rise.

This is a replica, it's the ""every day"" one, it is a lot lighter.' It's still very beautiful, with a dozen Tudor roses and intricate knots made of 9ct gold. But given the historical significance of the original chain, which dates back to 1698, it's probably best if it only comes out for very special occasions. Besides, Gilliland has enough to get used to without hauling around a huge hefty necklace. Although she's known for a couple of months that she would be the 353rd Lord Mayor of Dublin, her new year-long position was only officially revealed two weeks ago and Gilliland had only told some of her closest colleagues. 'I was conscious that agreements can all fall down,' she says. 'Also, I'm the type of person that until the chain was around my neck... I had said it to my immediate team why I was leaving but I didn't tell anyone else. 'Its exciting news but you don't want to distract from the former lord mayor's tenure and anyway, I had a day job to keep focused on.' A former primary school teacher, Gilliland is a full-time official with the teaching union INTO, with whom she is a senior learning and equality officer, although she is currently on a career break. She joined the Labour Party in 2009 and was elected to Dublin City Council in 2014, and is chair of its housing strategic policy committee. Gilliland was elected unopposed thanks to a council voting pact between Labour, the Greens, Fianna Fáil and the Social Democrats. Called the Dublin Agreement, it sees the four parties sharing power on the council until the next local elections in 2024. In her speech on June 28, when she took over from the Green's Hazel Chu, Gilliland firmly set out some of her objectives for the year ahead. 'I'm only the tenth ever female Lord Mayor but I'm hoping to give a priority to women and girls' issues and that will encourage them to feel more included in our city in its decision-making,' she said. 'And also to get involved in activism and politics.' The housing crisis and helping the city move out of the Covid-19 restrictions, she says, are two other priorities. But it is clear that gender equality is close to her heart. 'I know up until the early 1900s women wouldn't have held official leadership positions,' she says. 'But it's still pretty devastating that we haven't had all that many lord mayors. My tenure is only the second time a woman has handed over to another woman. 'I feel it's a bit like claiming leadership roles for women; there are so many amazing women out there who could be in leadership roles, but it's not happening.' She has high hopes for her party colleague, Ivana Bacik, who ran in Thursday's by-election for Dublin Bay South. 'I've been out with her canvassing a couple of times,' she says. 'She's so well known, particularly among women. And she's passed the most legislation through the Seanad, which is what we want, it's about legislation and how we can use it to make things better for people. So I would be very hopeful for her.' Gilliland is taking over from another very wellknown female politician, Hazel Chu. The former Lord Mayor certainly helped raised the profile of the office, she was enormously enthusiastic and vocal during her tenure. Unfortunately she also had to deal with some horrific abuse, mostly online. Is Gilliland prepared for the kind of vitriol that can be thrown at high-profile public representatives? 'It can be horrible, I do know during those years when Labour was being targeted, we suffered as well,' she says of when the party was in a coalition government with Fine Gael from 2011 to 2016. 'I got nasty messages on my phones, texts and voice messages. 'I just mute people on social media who I know are targeting me because I'm a Labour Party person. I think you have to. I think there is a tendency to target women, maybe because they feel you're an easier target, I think history has shown us that, like Joan Burton got horrific abuse, ridiculous stuff. 'If you look at who gets targeted: people who identify as a minority racial, ethnic or cultural group, the LGBTQI community, people with disabilities, and women because they're not in the majority in politics, they all get targeted. 'Hazel highlighted it, and I think by doing that you're getting advocates on board. 'I'm on Twitter, but you don't have time to read all comments, I'll be busy. And it's perhaps about putting a strategy in place to protect yourself. But also being able to communicate what you want to communicate. 'We have a media person in the Mansion House, I'm meeting him next week and we have Labour Party media people as well. But a lot of the time it's your own personal thing, I've always managed my own social media.' Being a local councillor for the last seven years has perhaps helped to thicken her skin against criticism from irate constituents? 'Oh yeah, but I'd also say I'm a good listener,' she says. 'There's a new development near me, and there's a lot of concern about it. When you meet people you listen, try and clear up any misinformation and take their concerns on board. 'If someone on social media is bashing you, because you've made a call on something or because you're a woman or because you're in Labour, it can be a little offensive. But I think when you know you've done the right thing, it might not be the popular thing, but it's the right thing, I think you can hold firm. 'You'll have other people who'll tell you it was the hard decision but a good one. I'm also good at trusting my own gut on things.' Growing up on a dairy farm in Ballybay in the middle of Co Monaghan, she says, taught her how to 'roll your sleeves up and get on with life'. The eldest of four children, her parents Lionel (who died ten years ago) and Mavis ran the farm together, which they grew to a herd of about 50 to 60 Friesian cows. 'It was pretty rural, if you needed to go anywhere, mum or dad had to drive you,' she says. 'Myself and my two brothers and sister would show the cattle at the shows. It was a really great lifestyle, we grew up with the attitude that you got on with things.' After graduating from college in 1989 as a primary school teacher, she found it impossible to get work and so headed to Granada in Spain, where she taught English. 'We were in the middle of a recession, so I went initially for a year,' she says. 'When I came back I still couldn't get a job again so I went back to Spain. I was on my own, I didn't know the language or anyone there. But a huge amount of people of that generation did the same.' She ended up living there for six years. 'It was tough in ways - when you train for a profession, you want to work at that,' she says. 'But going abroad to live for a while, you learn so much; skills about living on your own, integrating, adapting, different cultures, I think it's really healthy and gives you a totally different perspective.' She returned to Ireland in 1995. 'Things were a lot better and I got a subbing job in Our Lady Immaculate School in Darndale [on Dublin's northside],' she says. 'Then a temporary job and I worked there for six years. After that I worked in the Educate Together primary school in Swords for three years before I applied for a full-time job in the INTO. 'I got involved with the union when I started in Darndale, I went to local branch meeting, became branch organiser. I wanted to do that kind of advocacy, trying to help make changes for the better and in Darndale there were socioeconomic issues.' Getting involved in the INTO is not just about improving or maintaining conditions for teachers, she says, it's also about upgrading teaching practices for pupils. 'A lot of the time it's about resources for kids,' she explains. 'Speech and language therapists, psychologists, all of those resources makes it easier to teach them. I'm now on the board of the school in Darndale and one of the projects this year will be helping them become trauma-informed.' In between the change of jobs and joining Labour, she got a doctorate in educational learning from the University of Nottingham and a post-graduate diploma in educational leadership from the University of Lincoln. Joining a political party was suggested to her by a friend who was fed up listening to her complain about the news. 'It was the early 2000s, when things were getting difficult and I was talking back to the radio every time the news was on,' she says. 'I was also giving out to friends, a lot. Labour had that trade union affiliation, social justice, equality.' After about six years as a member, she decided to try her luck in the local elections. 'A local councillor left the party and in 2014 it was suggested that I run,' she says. 'We were in Government and people were a little hostile to us then, so I knew my chances were pretty slim. But I also thought it would be a few months of an incredible learning experience.' She ran in the Beaumont/Donaghmede ward and took the last seat. 'It can be a talk shop sometimes,' she says of Dublin City Council. 'I learned it takes time for people to talk through the issues before they're ready for solutions.' There was another election in 2019, when the ward was split in two. She ran again, this time in the Artane/Whitehall area, and was once again voted in. The other big concern she mentioned in her speech on Monday night, is housing. 'We are in such a crisis,' she says. Back when she was working in Darndale, in her first teaching job, she shared a house in Booterstown, a very nice suburb in south county Dublin with four friends. They each had their own bedroom and she thinks she paid about (EURO)300 a month at the time. 'Rents are so disproportionate to income now,' she says. 'I would be very concerned for the future. There's such an emphasis on home ownership and the minute it's bought it's like people want prices to increase so there's a value on it. But it's your home, we have to move away from thinking of housing as a commodity.' As Lord Mayor, which is a largely ceremonial role, what does she think she can do to help the situation? 'A lot of it is voicing the issues,' she says. 'I'll continue on the council's housing policy committee, I've been the chair of that for two years.' One of the projects she's been working on is nailing down a definition of what public housing means in Ireland. 'Everyone talks about public housing but there's no definition. There's social housing, which is what the council provides, a cost rental model and then there will be affordable purchase, once it's legislated for. 'So public housing means different things to different people.' About two years ago, Gilliland and former lord mayor Paul McAuliffe set up a symposium at the Mansion House to which they invited housing experts and stakeholders. 'We presented them with a definition of public housing to discuss,' she says. 'Then we took the feedback into the housing policy committee. We've put a position paper together, which looks at defining public housing as housing that is provided by your local authority or their nominee. 'It's open to anyone, regardless of their income and would be rented at an affordable rent proportionate to your income. It's not going to happen any time soon because our social housing lists are so long, but it's the ideal. We did have a lot of debate over purchase [people being able to buy the houses], but part of the reason that we are where we are is because local authorities sold off so many of the houses, we don't have the stock now. 'So the idea of it being rental means we retain the asset. We give someone a home at an affordable rent for as long as they want it. Then we turn it over again.' Gilliland, who is single, feels hugely fortunate that she was recently able to buy her own home in Artane. 'I bought an apartment in 2005 on my own,' she says. 'I sold it and bought a doer-up house in Artane at Christmas. I feel really lucky, I couldn't do it now, the way prices have gone.' One of the perks of her new job will be living in the apartment on the first floor of the Mansion Hotel. It's currently being prepared for her to move in. 'It's like having a ringside seat to see how the city works,' she says. 'Being right in the centre and able to walk around whenever you have a free moment. 'Pre-pandemic I did socialise in town, I worked in Parnell Square and usually went out with friends on a Friday night. Woodfire Pizza on Blessington Street was a spot we regularly went to. It's really gorgeous, a real neighbourhood place. 'This evening I'm going to take a wander up to Merrion Row before I head home, to see how it's going for all the businesses up there.' There's no doubt this new gig will help raise her profile over the next year, especially as Dublin, hopefully, emerges from all the restrictions. Is there a long-term plan to try for a Dáil seat? 'No, I don't have a plan,' she laughs. 'For the next year it's gender, housing and transitioning the city out of Covid.' At the handover ceremony on June 28, she was joined by her mum Mavis and her three nieces, who range in ages from nine to 12. 'We were only allowed to have very few people, ordinarily you'd be up in the chamber in City Hall and then there'd be an event in the Mansion House,' she says. 'But it was still lovely, mum is very proud. I'm not sure the girls were quite as impressed, I told them it would only last an hour and they were saying it went on far too long.' At least they got to check out the authentic chain of office in all its gold and glittering glory. Not many do.

Meet Aoife (not her real name), who contacted me after reading an article I wrote invoking Jaws to describe school safety. Until schools are safe, I pledged last August, ""my child's not getting back in the water"". Aoife (13) was shown the article by a teacher months after it was written as ""proof"" her safety concerns were justified. Her anxiety, which manifested as school refusal and selfharm, was dismissed as ""nonsense"" by a priest, which made her doubt her sanity. Relief at being told by her GP that he had seen ""an explosion"" of pandemic-related anxiety in children (""I'm normal"") was dashed on realising the waiting list to see a psychologist was over a year. Clocking my background as a therapist, Aoife messaged me for help. The contempt with which children have been treated throughout this pandemic reminds me of a scene in The West Wing in which White House communications director Toby Ziegler is confronted by a teenager for snubbing him. ""In society we're meaningless because we're powerless,"" he railed. ""No risk in offending us, we don't exist."" School closures - a feature of ""living with Covid"" - meant abuse and neglect went unnoticed, forcing some children to call the gardaí. Pause for a moment and think how frightened and courageous a child must be to dial 999, only to hear an automated message promising a call back that never comes. The recent Ombudsman for Children's report, ""A childhood paused"", showed 100pc of children who contacted them cited the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. The more socially disadvantaged and medically vulnerable, the harsher the impact. The highest number of complaints, 49pc, about education, describing 2020 as a ""devastating year for children"". Two months after emerging from a lockdown prolonged by importing the Alpha variant from Britain, the Delta variant, which is 60pc more transmissible with higher vaccine escape, is on our shores. Public Health England data shows that, with increasing numbers of adults vaccinated, this variant is targeting unvaccinated youngsters. We also know that double-vaccinated people can catch and transmit coronavirus and that vaccines may wane within months against this variant. This has significant implications for international travel, indoor socialising and the safe reopening of schools in September. Unable to return our child to school last September, we weren't offered any alternatives. Some teachers kindly kept us in the loop, but others just didn't have the time. Joy at being able to participate in remote learning with classmates in January descended into dismay. Teachers did their best, but being in earshot of live classes, it was apparent that many children struggled to cope. Some were sharing laptops and bandwidth with multiple siblings and missed classes. One child was so overwhelmed she broke down in tears. The teacher offered reassurance to the faceless child, but her voice too faltered. The strain on everyone was palpable. Instead of using months of lockdown to install ventilation, the government herded children back into unsafe, unventilated and overwere crowded classrooms. Desperate to get my son back to school safely and seeing no prospect of that happening at home, we loaded up the car and went to the Isle of Man, whose elimination strategy meant life continued as normal for most of the pandemic. As luck would have it, the Manx government recently announced it is shifting to a ""living with Covid"" non-strategy. Given there were zero cases at the time, they fast-tracked the Delta variant's arrival so that we could all learn to live with it. Schools are now several teachers down with pupils and parents isolating. Businesses that were previously open and thriving are shut because infected visitors ambled through their doors. Having three feet, like on the Isle of Man flag, doesn't mean shooting yourself in one of them is advisable. Aoife's parents don't have the luxury of upping sticks. They're both (un)employed in hospitality, which has been decimated by the Government's choice to put the aviation industry before SMEs; the lifeblood of our communities and economy. Last year, with fewer than 10 cases a day, we were living without Covid. Rather than opening pubs and restaurants, we opened borders and imported new variants instead. A year on, ""Living with Covid"" has killed 5,000 Irish citizens and condemned the rest to a purgatorial existence where deprivation of human and social contact has become a way of life. Hospitalisations and deaths cannot be the only metrics in operation ""Saving Summer"". Nphet warned that actions resulting in higher cases now jeopardise the safe reopening of schools. We know that children have suffered psychological and physical harm as a result of both school closures and attending unsafe www.schools.UK data indicates around 7,000 children suffer with long Covid beyond 12 months. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, epidemiologist at the University of London, warned: ""Exposing children to a novel virus that has long-term impacts is completely unethical."" Parents should not be forced to choose between their child's education and their safety. For those unmoved by children being potentially saddled with a chronic, debilitating illness for years to come, gifting Covid-unvaccinated, compliant hosts has other consequences. Dr Stephen Griffin, virologist and associate professor at the University of Leeds, warned: ""We can't ignore children in vaccination campaigns. If we do, we could end up in a cycle of variants."" Sunday's announced plan to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, while welcome, was conditional on Niac's long-awaited recommendation. For schools to open safely in September, as a minimum, we need eligible children to be vaccinated and ventilation systems installed in all classrooms Nelson Mandela said: ""The true character of society is revealed in how it treats its children."" Instead of gaslighting children like Aoife (now fully recovered) for raising safety concerns, we should join them in holding the Government to account. Instead of using lockdowns to install ventilation, children were herded into unsafe classrooms"

Super - the mother of all hangovers, and on a workday too. I check my phone - 7.45am - still a bit of time before I have to pull myself out of bed and… wait. Something is wrong. Something has happened, something bad - and I'm not sure what, until my blood runs cold when I do. My body is stock still, my mind trying to pick apart a blackness, an unconsciousness that is impossible to this day to decipher. Too many drinks, a party in an apartment, needing to lie down, a man following me. Then - nothingness. I have been sexually assaulted. I know this, but I have zero recollection of the attack - so what was I going to do? My absence of memory on the night in question has proved bittersweet. On the one hand, I am eternally grateful for not knowing, even though in reality it meant for me, and for so many others, justice would never be served. Almost 15 years after my attack, there's still such stigma, shame and indignity burdened by the female, all reinforced by the stereotypical views we continue to hold about sexual assault. I wasn't pulled into a dark alleyway by a sex-crazed deviant sociopath. It does indeed happen, but it didn't to me. I had no physical injuries. In fact, if you looked at me, you wouldn't have noticed anything particularly wrong at all. Those bloodshot eyes were as a result of too much partying, right? Right. And that shake in my voice? Definitely the fear. That's what you get for going out on a school night! I wasn't carted into the sexual assault treatment unit in Dublin's Rotunda Hospital, all black eyes and broken ribs. I drove myself, outwardly composed as a nausea rose in my stomach that had nothing to do with a hangover, into a Well Woman clinic. I was advised to report the incident to the guards. I didn't. Of course I didn't. I went into work, my hangover now superseded with a far more sinister presentiment, which would linger indefinitely. During those early days I would continually try to remember, question, doubt and wonder. And when I did, I felt repulsed. I wasn't going there. My mind had blacked out for self-pres- ervation, I reasoned. Of course this was a lie. I battled. I asked my friends: what should I do? One would say I should report the incident. Another would disagree. 'Why would you put yourself through that?' they would ask, and my most vulnerable self would nod. The legal system doesn't exactly protect sexual assault complainants when they are in court. 'You'll be the one on trial. It will be so traumatising.' I couldn't bring myself to do it. It would be easier to compartmentalise, tuck it away, get on with life. Stay silent, keep on trucking. This took time and practice, especially since I knew what my attacker looked like; where he lived. I was terrified of meeting him. What would I say? What would I do? Would he attack me again, in the cold, sober light of day? I wondered how he felt. Was he remorseful, or does that emotion exist in the mind of a predator? Did he even realise what he had actually done? Had he attacked before? Has he done it since? In holding my silence, this last part is the most difficult to reconcile. I felt I wasn't brave enough to stand up and say that this happened. As a result, this person was free to inflict something similar on another woman, on other women. For that, I felt like a coward. I also didn't want to be seen as a victim. I was a strong, empowered female, with opinions and a voice and a life; a positive, good reputation. I didn't want to be pitied, or worst of all, blamed. Because when a sexual assault happens, whether it's a slap on the bum or a non-consensual penetrative act, blame colours everything - and egged by society with a legal system designed to protect the defendant, it's the female who will take this hit. I wondered, for so long, was I complicit. I wore a red dress that night. It wasn't short, but it was figure hugging. I had drank far too much. That was my fault - I hadn't listened to the ads. I wasn't responsible. I should have minded myself more; then I may have remained safe. In my gut, I knew the truth. But, as in the lines of the Eurythmics song Sexcrime (Nineteen Eighty-Four), quoted by Minister Josepha Madigan this week in the Dáil, I chose to 'face the wall, turn my back against it all.' Tragically, I'm far from the exception. This article will resonate with countless women, who have, like me, been in similar situations, and yet kept silent. Perhaps they even thought their abuse wasn't serious enough to complain about - a grope on the breast or a slap on the backside - but it is. We have come to excuse and normalise this behaviour - but it's far from normal. It's intrinsically wrong. We have stayed quiet through fear and shame and stigma, dogged by the stereotypes and misconceptions we continue to hold as a society about sexual assault, the fear of judgment, the lack of support. Sexual assault continues to be, as Josepha said, the one crime that goes unreported. Is it a coincidence that it happens to be much more prevalent an issue for women? Hardly. In fact, when Josepha revealed that this week that she was a survivor of sexual assault, I could hardly believe my ears. Not that I didn't think it could happen - as the minister clearly stated, most women at her age, and mine at 42, will have suffered the trauma of sexual abuse in some form - but I was stunned that a politician verbalised the issue at all, especially her personal experience of it. When Josepha says that it is a lot more common than many believe, she is correct. And when she states that sexual assault is not always the random monster lurking in the middle of the night, once again, she is bang on. This last part can't be repeated enough. The majority of women know their assailants, so can we once and for all understand that it's not always the masked madman in the dark, forcibly holding down their victim, a knife at their throat? It could be a husband, relative, a neighbour, an acquaintance or a supposed friend. And the pandemic will have exacerbated the trauma caused by these heinous actions. And when Josepha says that sexual assault remains a corrosive blight on female safety and morale, once again, this is the truth. In an age of virtue signalling and empty rhetoric, her words this week could herald a real opportunity to change the script. Ireland has waited and watched as the rest of the world has spoken out about sexual violence against women, as the MeToo and Reclaim The Streets movements called for change. As a country, we have a shameful track record of how society has treated women. It's still shoddy. But in using her voice, Josepha Madigan has provided a catalyst for change, to finish 'the unfinished democracy that is Ireland when it comes to the representation and treatment of women'. Her personal revelations have begun to chip away at long-ingrained beliefs and stigmas. Now, we must take action. We desperately need a judicial system that supports and empowers women. We need legal reform so women can trust and feel supported when reporting these crimes. Let's become a country that encourages the female voice to speak, without judgement, without shame, and without fear. Josepha has started the conversation, and in doing so, she's given a voice to the rest of us - to break the silence, to share these stories, as difficult as they may be to tell, and uncomfortable to listen to. The question is, are we finally going to be heard? josepha's words herald a real chance to change the script i was advised to report the incident to the guards. of course i didn't"

But furious Hoops stars surrounded Croatian referee Mario Zebec at full-time as the lack of a whistle denied them a shot at a glorious night.

History was within sight - no Irish had ever overturned a two-goal deficit in a second leg. But Rovers were up and Slovan were rattled. But the referee had been poor for both sides all night as he seemed to from whistling for little to ignoring flying challenges. And his assistants were not much better, often waiting to see which team grabbed ball to flag for disputed throws. This inconsistency cost the Hoops the biggest way on 73 minutes.

Over 90 minutes Stephen Bradley's side deserved their victory and with 1,500 fans sounding like 15,000, it could have been a famous night had it stayed 2-0 and gone to extra-time. There were nervy moments, often self-inflicted, but two-thirds of the game went to plan. Rovers needed an early goal and got it on 16 minutes. Gary O'Neill provided the incisive pass to Burke just inside the area and as he turned he was scythed down by Vais Bozhikov. Burke calmly sent keeper Adrian Chovan the wrong way from the spot. Early on, Slovan had been taking no risks as defenders were happy to hit Row Z when under the tiniest bit of pressure. But after Burke's penalty, easy passes were misplaced, Weiss threw a strop over a challenge and Ezekiel Henty was booked for dissent after, rightfully, arguing his deflected shot should have earned a corner. That Henty effort came when goalkeeper Alan Mannus' attempted pass to Finn was intercepted on the edge of the Rovers area. And other sloppy touches from Lopes and Towell might have cost Rovers any chance of pulling back the tie, with Henty firing wide after the former. But that is not to say the Rovers defence was a bundle of nerves. After a shaky start, Lopes recovered and dealt with everything - until Ratao's illegal intervention - while Joey O'Brien never put a foot wrong. Mannus, who saved a penalty in the first leg, also had to make an outstanding double stop just after Burke's opening goal. Joeri de Kamps was first to test him with a shot from 25 yards that he could only palm out, but he did brilliantly to turn away David Hrncar's follow-up. The opening period of the second half was all Rovers as pressure built on Chovan's goal. Finn stung the keeper's palms with a shot on 58 minutes after good work from Burke and Liam Scales. And the small crowd were ecstatic when Towell netted a stunner on 64 minutes to level it on aggregate. He was standing just outside the area when Rory Gaffney teed him up. He took one touch and then unleashed a shot that was still rising as it hit the back of the net. Slovan now needed a goal and Ratao fired narrowly wide. Three minutes after that they got one - but Weiss' strike should never have stood. Still, with the away goals rule gone, the Hoops still needed just one more to force extra-time. And they went for it. Chovan needed to make a finger-tip save to keep out a Lopes header from a corner and Lee Grace glanced another corner inches off target after Aaron Greene's header was deflected wide. But time ran out and Rovers must make do with the consolation of a Europa Conference League thirdround tie in a few weeks' time.

After a week which had seen outstanding Leinster championship victories for Kildare against Wexford and Laois at under 20 and minor levels respectively, the Lilywhite seniors came into this game knowing a win by four points or more would propel them into the tier-two final less than a year after winning the Christy Ring Cup. A great save by Paddy McKenna from Killian Doyle helped the visitors to lead by 0-4 to 0-2 at the first water break. They extended their lead to five points before Westmeath rallied to draw level. The crucial score of the first half came on the half-hour mark, when a great catch by Niall Mitchell helped to tee up Ciarán Doyle for a well-taken goal. Westmeath led by 1-9 to 0-9 at half-time. Kildare deservedly regained the lead (0-14 to 1-10) with a Brian Byrne point in the 45th minute. Noel Conaty then came to Westmeath's rescue with a great save from Byrne. Niall O'Brien set up impressive full-forward Mitchell for a great goal just before the second water break, when the Lake County led by 2-12 to 0-14. However, David Herity's charges refused to lie down and fine play by sub Shane Ryan set up Jack Sheridan for a goal in the 68th minute.

Never watch TV. And always choose the school play over work. Here, FitFlop founder Marcia Kilgore shares",FALSE,"THE majority of entrepreneurs are happy to make one business an outstanding success. At 52, Marcia Kilgore has three under her belt. There's Bliss Spa, FitFlop ergonomic sandals and Soap & Glory, the cutely packaged bath range she sold to Boots in 2014 for a reported (EURO)52 million. Now she's back at the start-up stage with fledgling venture Beauty Pie, and is once again finding that 'all the best ideas' begin by 'terrifying people'. 'If it's not different and radical and it doesn't scare people, someone has probably done it already,' she says, citing the example of her best-selling FitFlop clog, the Shuv. 'We launched it ten years ago and at first women were really scared of it. Today we sell tons of them.' Launched in 2016, Beauty Pie has encountered a similar, if not more extreme, reaction in some quarters. 'We got a lot of hate at the beginning. It was just extraordinary.' Kilgore's idea is bound to - indeed, designed to - rile what she calls 'the beauty industry's old boys' network'. Traditional high-end brands have hugely inflated the prices of cosmetic and skincare products, she claims. By signing up customers to a membership scheme, from (EURO)6 to (EURO)24 a month, Beauty Pie says it can offer reductions of 'up to 80 per cent' on a range sourced from the same factories used by those brands but packaged simply and sold online. Kilgore aims to refashion the way we buy beauty, swapping expensive one-off purchases for a locked-in subscription package, a bit like Amazon Prime - the holy grail of business models. entrepreneur, The who's mum to Louis, 16, and Raphael, 14, has the slick but steely vibe of a woman who's been in business since the early 1990s and has never expected the world to make it easy for her. 'People always resent a zeitgeistchanging idea at first. I'm showing people they can buy their (EURO)60 face cream for (EURO)12 and they think it's impossible. But it's not.' She grew up in Saskatchewan, Canada, and early on learned that life could be horribly unpredictable. 'My father died of brain cancer when I was 11, and my mother, my two sisters and I were kind of left to fend for ourselves. 'We weren't homeless, but we had to watch the budget. I got a part-time job, then another one, then I was doing three. You hustle. And you're not afraid of losing everything as you didn't have much in the first place.' For a while she was a bodybuilder and personal trainer, and then, having escaped to New York, she opened a one-room studio offering facials and waxing. At a time when 'spa treatments' largely meant eating salad and bathing in mineral waters, Bliss Spa - as the business became - took the concept of beauty treatments and made them mainstream and aspirational. Sold in 1999 for (EURO)22 million to luxury firm LVMH, the brand began popping up in top hotels and the spa boom began. Juggling a family of her own came a few years later. By then she was living in London with French husband Thierry Boue, now 66. 'Louis was two and my youngest, Raf, was a newborn when I started Soap & Glory. Then, a year after that, I began FitFlop. 'I used nannies. I had to until they went to school. Even at the weekends, I'd go back to the office and do extra work when they were asleep. I had very little social life, and even today I don't ever sit down and watch TV. 'Women must remember that they have a choice between being fulfilled and, I guess, being secure. Doing what fulfils you doesn't necessarily pay the bills. It's super hard to run a business and a family, but you learn to live in the moment, manage your time and make sacrifices.' She never missed a school play for the sake of 'selling 300 more jars of body butter', but she did miss dinner with friends. 'You do the deathbed test, and clearly a school play beats an afternoon in the office by that measure.' Defiantly Gen X in her attitude towards the differences between men and women in business, she's clear that women shouldn't expect an easy ride from potential investors. 'There's going to be sexism. If a man says he'll ask his wife what she thinks of my idea [in beauty], I'm not going to be offended. Not everyone understands what a moisturiser is! If someone rejects you, you haven't communicated your idea well enough.' Soap & Glory was her hardest sell, and for months she made just over (EURO)200 a week, but FitFlop was an instant success. The difference, perhaps, lay in the originality of the idea. 'FitFlop was crazy. People got it immediately and we couldn't keep up with demand.' Now, Beauty Pie is just breaking even. The pandemic is causing supply-chain issues and Kilgore has become an expert in global shipping routes. During lockdown, as women turned to internet shopping, Beauty Pie ran out of stock. Has Covid accelerated the death of real-life shopping? 'Shopping has to evolve as an experience,' she insists. 'A store like Selfridges has done it well. You go to the champagne bar and it's a pleasure to be out. 'Do we still need the beauty counter? Some people love it, some find it intimidating. Websites are getting just as good at giving you information on products as counter staff. But I hope it's still part of retail as it can be great fun.' A former winner of the Ambassador Award at the NatWest Everywoman Awards, she's one of this year's judges and a supporter of the network for businesswomen. 'I try to mentor everyone in my organisation and I love it when they go on to build businesses.' Her big tip is for would-be entrepreneurs to constantly ask themselves what the purpose of their business is, and to hone that message into one brilliant sentence to wow investors. 'I've never had a business plan that worked only on the principle of making money - there's always a bigger purpose to do with making things better for women. There's no reason why they should settle for paying such a lot for skincare, for example. I want them to carry that idea over into every aspect of their life.'

A sharp rise in the price of goods and services gobbles up the real value of household incomes and savings and leaves us all worse off. When it really gets going, an inflationary squeeze can be brutal, but we are a long way from the eye-watering price rises of the 1970s and 1980s. Even so, inflation is back, and after a decade's absence it is being keenly felt. The cost of a plethora of goods and services is rising in Ireland and across the world at a pace that has not been felt since before the global financial crisis. Experts are divided on whether it is a blip - caused by the disruptions to world markets from Covid such as shipping containers ending up in the wrong place and factories struggling to fulfil orders due to complications of reopening - or the start of something more sustained. The 'official view' from central banks tends to see the current bout of inflation as short-term, according to Conall MacCoille, chief economist at Davy. ""There's a view that this is not going to be sustained, because there is a lot of slack in labour markets and the impact of Covid on supply chains will work through,"" he said. That is why the European Central Bank insisted yesterday it will not panic if inflation passes the 2pc mark this year, a level that in the past would have had policymakers sharpening their pens for an interest rate rise to cool things down. Dan O'Brien, chief economist at the Institute for International and European Affairs think-tank, is less worried about inflation and more that the scale of the economic damage from Covid is being underestimated, partly because business failures and resulting job losses have been delayed but not really prevented. When that dust settles, short-term inflation may be masking much more worrying economic weaknesses, he fears. On the other hand, MacCoille thinks inflationary pressures may build. Global demand is being boosted by deficit-funded spending by governments, including the US, but also our own and others in Europe. Add the savings glut potentially about to be unleashed, you have a wall of cash chasing limited supplies, creating scarcity and further price hikes. If that is right, at an individual level the best way to beat a rising cost of living is a pay rise to match or even beat the hikes, but that only fuels inflation. In reality, Covid has left huge numbers of people out of work, so the chances of an ultimatum to your boss translating into a pay hike is probably limited. The other way to beat inflation is to own your own home, ideally debtfree or with interest rates locked in for the longer-term. Cold comfort for many there. So, if it hits hard, inflation will strike the most economically vulnerable hardest. Graphic   Bargain hunters: Shoppers check out the stores yesterday on Henry Street in Dublin.

Now a new biography claims her dazzling looks were her biggest enemy",FALSE,"ICO turned heads wherever she went, so beautiful that an envious friend claimed even the furniture groaned with anticipation when she came into a room. N Men went wild for the willowy German ex-model and archetypal 'ice maiden'. Her lovers and admirers in the 1960s constituted the cream of rock music: Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Brian Jones, Iggy Pop and her Velvet Underground bandmate Lou Reed, as well as the French film star Alain Delon. And it wasn't just the boys - Nico may have had lesbian affairs with French movie star Jeanne Moreau and fashion icon Coco Chanel. Her sonorous baritone voice was unforgettable, too, though not always so fondly remembered. Andy Warhol, who launched her music career, said it was like 'an IBM computer with a Garbo accent'. And yet the enigmatic singersongwriter spent most of her final years living in obscurity in grey Manchester suburbs, hopelessly addicted to heroin and mired in accusations of racism. She was only 49 when she died from a cerebral haemorrhage in a bizarre accident that saw her fall off a bicycle and hit her head while on holiday in Ibiza in 1988. Today, she's largely remembered as the 'Queen of Weird', a comically over-serious Teutonic femme fatale who made unlistenably gloomy records, or else as an over-sexed super-groupie who showed just how far you could get in showbusiness with great bone structure. Now, a new biography - You Are Beautiful And You Are Alone - sets out to rescue her legacy and portray her as tragically misunderstood. Traumatised by her early years in a war-shattered Germany, she was vulnerable, isolated and even naive. As for her notorious aloofness, which could reduce the cockiest rock star to a quivering wreck, that was really down to a crippling shyness. In a flattering, feminist take on the eccentric singer, biographer Jennifer Otter Bickerdike also claims that her ethereal beauty came to be Nico's biggest enemy, obscuring her talent. Nico, she says, was the victim of misogynists and hypocrites who tolerate male pop stars sleeping around and taking drugs, but not women. However, there's no denying Nico lived up to her desolate reputation. A close friend described sharing her home with Nico as like 'living in a funeral parlour'. BUT it's little wonder, says her biographer, that Nico should be such a misery given her early life. Born Christa Paffgen in Cologne in 1938, she was four when her father was killed in battle. She and her mother struggled by with little money. Nico - who said they tried to pass food and water to Jews as they trundled by in trains to the concentration camps - recalled hiding in the family bathtub as the bombs rained down around their tiny flat in Berlin. The solitary and friendless little girl's favourite place to play was a nearby graveyard. She was 12 when she started talking in her strange way, drawing out every word, and ignoring appeals to speak normally. 'Christa was a very strange girl,' recalls her Aunt Helma. 'She walked very upright. And she was either shy or conceited. Or both.' Nico claimed she was raped by a black US soldier when she was 13. She left war-devastated Berlin as soon as she could, heading off to Paris to become a fashion model at 16 and changing her name to Nico. She struggled to stay slim and had her first experience of drug addiction when she became over-reliant on diet pills. Coco Chanel was said to flirt with her female models and Nico said the fashion designer 'corrupted her' in Paris. But given Chanel would have been 73, an affair seems unlikely, says the new book. Nico never liked modelling and got a chance to move into acting when she met the celebrated Italian film director Federico Fellini in 1959. 'I have dreamt of you,' he gushed, and gave her a memorable cameo role in La Dolce Vita. That led to other roles during which Nico reportedly said she had an affair with French actress Jeanne Moreau. 'She had this notion that it was chic to be a lesbian,' said a friend. Nico also met French heartthrob and inveterate womaniser Alain Delon. They had a 'whirlwind affair' on the Italian island where he was filming, which blew Nico away - but not Delon, who was involved with his co-star Romy Schneider. A friend recalled Nico as being 'very happy and excited', and saying, 'I've just slept with Alain Delon!' The friend added: 'It was like Snow White had met her prince. She was obsessed with this ghastly man.' After a subsequent one-night stand in New York, she became pregnant and decided to have the baby. Friends were gobsmacked that she genuinely believed Delon would marry her. He has always denied being the boy's father. Nico left her son Ari in Ibiza with her mother, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease, so she could go off and earn money for all of them from acting, modelling and - so she hoped - singing. It was a disastrous move. The toddler was largely left to fend for himself and Delon's mother, Edith, ended up rescuing and eventually adopting Ari after finding him 'crouching like an animal' in a dark room that stank of faeces and vomit. On the occasions she 'borrowed' Ari, Nico was a chaotic parent. The child sometimes went around after concerts drinking all the leftover alcohol he could find. Otter Bickerdike writes: 'It has been written, but not confirmed, that Nico allegedly smeared heroin on the child's gums to calm him down.' Nico appears to have been much more worried about her career. Her music ambitions got a boost when she met Bob Dylan in Paris in 1964. Legend has it that Nico invited the folk singer up to her apartment, where they stayed for 'an evening and a week'. Nico gushed to an interviewer about Dylan's 'heavenly blue eyes'. She says Dylan reciprocated, writing the song I'll Keep It With Mine about her. Her next rock conquest was the trickier Rolling Stones co-founder Brian Jones, whom she met after a Paris concert. 'He was charming, until he locked the door,' she said of his violent bedroom behaviour, a consequence supposedly of his frustration at his drughampered sexual performance. Nico described how he punched her, and worse. She said she often tried to talk to him about poetry and music, 'but he was really too stoned to talk about anything, and often so was I'. Fellow model 'Zouzou' insisted Nico - almost 6ft - had the upper hand as she towered over Jones, who was barely 5ft 5in. 'He was scared of her and frightened of confrontations with her,' Zouzou recalled. 'We would be at parties and if Nico came into the room Brian would say, ""Oh no, you'd better disappear for a bit"". She was a big, threatening woman.' Nico made a record in the UK with Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham, which he described as 'f*****g awful'. Even so, he liked Nico. 'She wasn't aloof at that point. She was one of a new breed of woman, like Anita Pallenberg and Yoko Ono, who could have been a man,' said Oldham. 'Far better that, than the silly little English teacups around at that time.' What some might see as her shameless opportunism with famous rock stars was actually a 'naive vulnerability', insists her biographer. She headed to New York with little Ari to make some easy money from modelling but instead met Andy Warhol at a Mexican restaurant. 'She was sitting at a table with a pitcher in front of her, dipping her long beautiful fingers into the sangria, lifting out slices of wine-soaked oranges,' the Pop Art king recorded. On spotting him, Nico 'tilted her head to the side and brushed her hair back with her other hand and said very slowly, ""I only like the fooood that flooooats in the wiiine"".' Warhol was smitten and recruited her to his art enclave, The Factory. Everyone else there had verbal diarrhoea but Nico barely spoke. Some Warhol acolytes assumed that was because she had nothing to say, while others concluded it was simply because she had hidden depths and was happy to observe. Everyone, especially the women, were intimidated by her. HE Velvet Underground - the black-clad, avant garde rock band fronted T by Lou Reed - considered her a 'fly in the ointment', said Welsh member John Cale. Reed, notoriously temperamental and jealous, was furious she had been foisted on them but Warhol, who was masterminding the as yet unknown band, insisted they needed glamour. Their seminal first album in 1967 was duly titled The Velvet Underground & Nico. Nico had wanted to sing on every song but the band thwarted her, saying her broken English wasn't good enough. But Reed warmed to Nico's presence in the band sufficiently to have an affair with her, a fling Cale described as 'both consummated and constipated'. Nico would later complain that Reed was manipulative, but fellow band member Sterling Morrison saw Nico as the real Machiavelli, always manoeuvering herself close to whoever was dominant. Nico ended the fiery relationship, telling Reed: 'I cannot make love to Jews any more' during a band rehearsal. She lost their subsequent battle of egos and left the band. While John Cale (who also later had an affair with her) insisted she was simply indulging in the band's twisted sense of humour, Nico critics marked it down as evidence of her racism - as they did an incident in 1971 in which she smashed a wine glass in the face of a black girl who was complaining about racial inequality. The singer reportedly shouted: 'Suffering? You don't know what suffering is!' Nico called it a 'fit of madness' while she was high on drugs, but facing threats from the Black Panthers, she was forced to leave the US for a time. Her attempt at a solo music career met with critical contempt and empty venues, even as big male stars continued to swoon over her. Leonard Cohen was besotted but admitted: 'Within five minutes of our conversation, she told me to forget it because she was only interested in young men.' He was 33 at the time. It does seem that all the male adulation went to Nico's head. She flew to London in the late 1960s and turned up out of the blue at the home of photographer David Bailey, expecting to stay with him. He foisted her on Paul McCartney, who allowed her to stay for several weeks, but was saved from the embarrassment of his girlfriend Jane Asher's imminent return when Warhol pitched up in London and took Nico off his hands. She met the singer Jim Morrison in 1967 and the glamorous pair shocked hos fellow Doors members with the noisiness of their nights of passion, drinking and drug-taking. He was the only one of her many musician lovers who encouraged her to write her own material and play an instrument. She took up the harmonium (reed organ). 'She was very serious about it, dreadfully serious, like a Nazi organist,' said a flatmate. 'She'd pull the curtains across and do this funereal singing all day long.' WHAT really sealed the fate of her career was her drug-taking. Nobody can agree which of her rock friends introduced Nico to heroin in the 1960s, but by 1970 she was injecting. Friends were appalled to see her neglect her appearance as she became heavily addicted. She continued to perform to fund her habit, relocating to the UK where she was championed by new wave bands who revered The Velvet Underground. She was so far gone that when, in 1979, she was finally united with her son Ari, now 17, Nico ended up injecting heroin with him. 'While it does seem horrifying, it may also be understandable,' says her biographer. Why? Because Nico 'did not have much experience as a parent' and the drug provided a 'mutual bond'. Nico spent her last seven years in London and Manchester, mostly the latter which had a reliable heroin supply. She lived in squats and rancid bedsits, going out in a long black cape and biker boots. 'Her days were often spent in bed, shooting up, or trying to score drugs,' says the new book. Ironically, Nico had got herself off heroin shortly before her death. In those final years, she made a point of not trying to prettify herself - she'd lost her teeth and put on a lot of weight - confiding that her worst regret was that she hadn't been born a man as she would have been taken seriously. But would she really? The supporting evidence, sadly for the ever hopeful Nico, was very thin. ?

On Thursday the European Central Bank (ECB) governing council announced a long-awaited major policy change on its inflation target, but markets were instead obsessed with US 10-year Treasury prices. What would have otherwise been the market-moving development of the day was relegated to a sidenote as investors had a mini-meltdown over American economic growth as bond prices rose and stocks fell. Meanwhile, over in Frankfurt, Lagarde and her colleagues were confirming that the ECB would now be implementing a ""symmetric"" 2pc inflation target instead of aiming to keep inflation at or near 2pc. That means the ECB now will be prepared to tolerate occasional inflation above 2pc if, over the medium term, average inflation balances out at around 2pc. This represents a material shift in expectations management, signalling that the famously conservative central bank - including its austere German members - is willing to let the eurozone economy run hotter as it recovers from the pandemic. Yet investors took little notice of this message of increased support from a major market player. After all, higher inflation tolerance implies higher growth expectations. Unfortunately, though, reality is getting in the way of the messaging. The ECB can set all the new targets it wants, but inflation has been hard to come by. The ECB's own inflation projection for 2023 - the furthest out that it forecasts - is just 1.4pc, although governing council minutes from the June meeting show that members believe it is ""subject to upward risks"" and could go higher. Here in Ireland annual inflation in the year to June was just 1.6pc, which was actually down on May's 1.9pc. Sure, there are plenty of localised or short-term instances of inflation. For instance, energy prices are on the rise. The cost of building materials has also been increasing due to supply chain issues. But temporary, smallscale blips are not what the ECB is looking to achieve. From a consumer point of view, this is fine. Lower prices means lower costs. On a personal level, that represents a benefit. But moderately increasing inflation after an economic crisis is a positive sign that a recovery is taking hold. When it doesn't happen - when labour markets don't tighten, when wages stagnate, when prices flat-line - central bankers worry and so do investors. Instead of a healthy upward spiral of prosperity, there can be a vicious circle of self-fulfilling low expectations. Worst of all, low inflation means that the very large debt burdens being carried by countries and corporations will have to be paid back rather than inflated away. It may not be nice for savers (Germans), but disappearing debt burdens is a nice side effect of steady, manageable, long-term inflation. If Lagarde and Co are serious about implementing this, they are more likely to keep the money taps open. The idea behind their policy is to support governments and the banking system. Ireland provides a great example of how. With the ECB keeping a lid on bond yields, the Irish Government has been able to borrow very cheaply - essentially for free - on the capital markets to fund the fiscal stimulus that has kept the economy afloat since March 2020. The next step is to help us on the other side when we have to pay it back. Higher pay and lower debt - who could argue with that? In Ireland annual inflation in the year to June was just 1.6pc Higher pay and lower debt - who could argue with that?

Your policy document will provide details of what is covered and what's excluded, Ms McCarthy said. Policies will also often have conditions attached to the placement or location of items within the car, whether they are on display or securely locked away.

I have two pensions that are due to mature in nine years' time. Are there any questions that I should be asking to make sure that my pension is on the right track? A Getting Getting advice of staying regular pensions advice is an important part of staying on track with your investments. The advice is also important to ensure you maintain the right level of risk for the stage you are at in building your fund, and ensuring you are not paying any unnecessary extra fees or charges. Getting reliable pension advice at intervals over the years can have a significant impact on your fund overall, rather than only talking with a financial broker when you are starting out, according to Mark Reilly, pensions proposition lead at Royal London. The primary questions many ask are: How are my investments performing, and am I putting in enough? It's important to keep a regular eye on fund performance to make sure that your money is doing the best it can for you and that you will hit your target fund size by the time you retire, Mr Reilly added. As you are trying to keep track of two policies, ask if there are benefits in consolidating both to make them easier to manage.

We want to sell them just to realise the capital loss and to offset this against some other share gains. motor provide loss of car These shares are no longer traded on the Irish Stock Exchange and are now only traded on the Swiss market. This requires us to set up an account with a stockbroker licensed to trade on the Swiss market. I suspect this will involve some substantial costs. In order to crystalise the loss and have it eligible for offset against other share gains, do we have to go through the process of actually selling these with the attendant costs, or is there another way of making these eligible for offset? A Section S538 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 allows you to make a claim to Revenue to have the losses allowed for tax purposes without you actually disposing of the shares, according to the consumer tax manager at www.Taxback.com, Marian Ryan.

The money-transfer company born as TransferWise opened at 800p, giving it a market capitalisation just shy of £8bn ((EURO)9.3bn). That's more than double the valuation in a July 2020 fundraising. After jumping as much as 4pc, the stock traded at 825p. The company eschewed a traditional initial public offering, opting not to raise fresh funds. Instead, shareholders were offloading a stake of at least 2.4pc directly into the open market. ""The successful direct listing of Wise is clearly a boost to London's ambitions as a global hub for tech companies,"" said Liberum Capital strategist Joachim Klement. ""Wise is a highly profitable and fast-growing challenger to traditional banks, that is what counts for investors,"" he said. Wise's first-day pop brought some relief to London, where high-profile new stocks such as food-delivery startup Deliveroo and semiconductor technology firm Alphawave IP Group have had disappointing trading debuts this year. Wise's listing also rode the tailwind of a rally in tech stocks. Unlike the traditional initial public offerings for Deliveroo and Alphawave, where banks set a price based on investor feedback during roadshows, Wise's valuation was determined by demand during an hours-long opening auction. While Deliveroo was felled by its lofty valuation, investors also balked at the company's unequal voting rights. More common in the US and used by the likes of Google parent Alphabet and Facebook, dual-class shares are controversial in the UK. They are seen as putting new shareholders at a disadvantage, with a select group of backers retaining tight control over the business even after going public. Wise's sale will lead to ""greater acceptance of enhanced voting rights among more and more investors, particularly growth investors,"" said Gavin Launder, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management. Still, the ""limited amount of stock available in the listing means it could be squeezed a bit too high to start with,"" he said. Wise's listing price is ""richer"" than expected, especially in comparison to its profitability, and indicates a shift in European stocks toward ""more US type valuations,"" said Colin McLean, chief investment officer at SVM Asset Management. Wise's revenue grew nearly 40pc to £421m in its latest financial year. Profit before tax for the year more than doubled to £41m, it said. Wise's listing follows the British government's plans to allow dual-class share ownership on the top tier of the LSE, where they are currently prohibited. The proposed change is part of a wider effort to make it easier for companies to go public in London. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak last week promised to make London ""the world's most advanced and exciting financial services hub"". Wise, which counts billionaire Peter Thiel, Silicon Valley's Andreessen Horowitz and UK-based Baillie Gifford among its early investors, considered listing in the US ""but London was the choice,"" Chief Financial Officer Matt Bri- ers said in June. ""London is a great place to access global capital, and it's also a great place to do a direct listing, a little-known secret that we are about to blow up."" Wise was started in 2011 when Estonian-born co-founders Taavet Hinrikus and Kaarmann grew frustrated with the high fees charged by banks on money sent from London back to their homeland. The firm now has more than 10 million customers. It's ""a watershed moment for London,"" said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive officer of Aquis Exchange, a share-trading platform. ""While one deal alone doesn't a city make, innovative deals of the kind will help establish the UK as a global hub that can compete with the US."" Wise's successful debut aside, bankers aren't anticipating a rush of direct listings in the UK, saying this route to public markets will be limited to a select few well-funded companies with wide investor bases. Spearheaded by the likes of streaming service Spotify Technology in New York, they are popular among founders of tech startups, and typically used to sidestep hefty underwriting fees and hit-or-miss pricing in traditional IPOs. But recent stumbles in the US, including by cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global are raising doubts about this route to market. Companies also cannot raise fresh capital in a direct listing, which only gives existing holders the opportunity to cash out.

411,411,/home/paultrust/Downloads/Files(415)/Wise listing gives London fintech firm status a boost.DOCX,The Irish Times,2021-07-13,1124 words,FEATURES; Pg. 11,Geraldine Walsh,NA,Women feel unheard and dismissed when it comes to health; The failure to act on the health priorities of women is reprehensible,FALSE," Ireland's history in validating and prioritising women's health is disproportionately lacking with the scandals of the past century sadly emphasising the fragmented connection. From the recent CervicalCheck Scandal in 2018 and the death of Savita Halapannavar in 2012 to the historical controversies of the mother and baby homes, the Thalidomide scandal and more, the disconnect in hearing and acting on the health priorities of women is reprehensible.  As such, women reasonably feel unheard, unseen and thereby dismissed when discussing and actively looking for help when it comes to their health. And yet, while women are notably more proactive about their health, which varies depending on their stage of life, they also actively report complications in accessing the care they need which can be associated with stereotypical views held by healthcare practitioners, resulting in poor or wrong diagnosis and treatment. They are less likely to be treated for pain than men, with their symptoms not taken as seriously or a diagnosis not adequately given. Intrinsically, when women feel set aside in such a manner their relationship with their health suffers, with the belief that their pain or symptoms are not sufficient enough to be an issue. They battle a stigma and discrimination while acutely seeking the basic human right of healthcare. Financial reasons  In a report titled Strategy on Women's Health and Wellbeing in the WHO European Region, the World Health Organisation says women see themselves as less healthy than men, they report more ill-health yet regularly forego care for financial reasons and that equal access to our health services remains problematic for minority, migrant, refugee or asylum-seeking women. The evident gender gap in accessing healthcare is joined by socio-economic factors. These include where women are born, live and work, and whether they have sufficient income and housing. They also relate to their access to various supports, with their diet and lifestyle being additional considerations. These disparities in women's health can be seen in clinical research, in trials, and in adverse reactions to medication - with women 1½ times more likely than men to develop unfavourable effects to prescription drugs. There is a notable lack of research into the specifics of women's bodies, with women historically seen as a vulnerable group and excluded from research for their purpose of being potential mothers. Clinical trials are often based on a stronger cohort of men and medications used by women, most notably for example the pill, are often based on male bodies. The WHO recognises that despite a somewhat increased presence of women in certain clinical trials, participation is ""especially low in studies in which safety, safe dosage range and side effects are determined. This results in a lack of awareness among healthcare professionals about the importance of sex-specific differences in disease manifestation and response to treatment throughout the life-course, which can cause problems in diagnosis and treatment.""  The gender bias sitting drastically in our waiting rooms has created considerable inequalities in how women are seen, understood and treated, with substantial blocks in how they access healthcare. Lacking patient education expands women's knowledge gap in understanding their own health issues. Female reproductive health, mental wellbeing and maternal health are all subjected to a bias and stigma which result in a higher incidence of negative experiences. Outside of the female reproductive body, the health of women is also unbalanced in terms of chronic diseases, violence against women and the health and wellbeing of older women. The WHO recognises that gender stereotypes have consequences for women's health in terms of self-confidence and wellbeing. Within the report they suggest, in particular, that concerns about physical appearance may cause girls and young women to develop eating disorders and other mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety. Moreover, stereotypes and sexism pave the way for certain forms of oppression, such as sexual harassment and gender-based violence.  National conversation In reflecting on women's health we must recognise the national conversation surrounding the 2018 referendum on the  Eighth Amendment to legalise abortion, and the broad and necessary discussion this encouraged in advocating for women's health. This advancement, along with the tragedies of scandals that blatantly ignored or disregarded the issue of women's health, has underpinned certain aspects of progress in strengthening targeted healthcare for women. What is needed is a continuous and vast narrative on understanding, appreciating and acting on the needs of women across a range of supports to include marginalised women and those of all ethnicities and backgrounds.  The Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health 2016-2030 advocates, at an international level, ""to end preventable deaths among all women, children and adolescents, to greatly improve their health and wellbeing, and to bring about the transformative change needed to shape a more prosperous and sustainable future"". In line with international and European action plans, there are a small number of women-specific national strategies which focus on women's health in maternity, reproductive health, breastfeeding and sexual health with further non-gender specific health and wellbeing strategies encompassing women and men. With the hope that the established Women's Health Taskforce, prioritising gynaecological health, menopause and mental health, will offer proactive solutions, opportunities and services for women, we are cognisant of our overwhelmed and understaffed health service, compounded by long waiting lists.  The dedicated women's health fund has the opportunity to progress a programme which actively supports under-represented female healthcare issues. But for women to engage with such programmes, tackling the bias encompassing these aspects of women's wellbeing is necessary, including pregnancy and birth-related issues, reproductive health and mental health. To address the inequities of the gender health gap is to give women a voice. Empowering women to take control of their health assists them in successfully navigating and challenging the stigma and bias they face in reproductive and female-centred health issues. In addition, addressing and confronting the public perception of women's health is to tackle these biases and vast misconceptions from the outset thereby improving women's physical and mental wellbeing. As is recognised by the WHO, engagement of women to ensure they are at the centre of change is a defining factor for success."

But do you own the latest bathroom must-have with a second-mortgage price tag: a luxury toothpaste? Used to two-for-one deals with the weekly shop, a tube of 'whitening' gel might seem the height of sophisticated dental care. But there is a raft of new pampering products for your pearly whites ? and they're proving wildly popular, despite their cost. When upmarket pharmacy John Bell & Croyden introduced Swiss Smile's (EURO)115 d'Or toothpaste with 23.75-carat gold dust, it sold out within hours. And the store has reported an 18 per cent rise in posh paste sales during lockdown. Clearly the sight of our yellowing gnashers on endless Zoom calls has forced many of us to rethink how we care for our teeth. But what exactly do these eye-wateringly expensive toothpastes offer? It's the quality and concentration of the ingredients that counts, apparently. Not all fluoride formulas, for example, are equally effective. Pricier versions often contain a higher concentration of powerful protective ingredients meaning you need to use less, while cheaper ones may be full of fillers to make them look white. And if you're hoping for superior mouth care, beware sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), commonly added to toothpaste to make it foam. 'SLS is terrible for the mouth,' says dentist Dr Uchenna Okoye. 'It's drying, and for those who experience a dry mouth, it can make it worse.' But should you really splash out on gold dust for a sparkly smile? We put premium toothpastes to the test ... SPLASH OUT TO FLASH A HOLLYWOOD SMILE Apa Beauty White Toothpaste, (EURO)13.80, www.cultbeauty.com MOST dentists advocate fluoride to prevent tooth decay as it repairs, or 'remineralises', enamel weakened by acid. But New York aesthetic dentist Dr Michael Apa, who caters for upmarket clientele including Catherine Zeta-Jones, Uma Thurman and Ashley Olsen, opts for a fluoridefree formula. This 'advanced-whitening' toothpaste comes in a sleek and minimalist white plastic tube. VERDICT: It claims to have 'Ultrapolish technology' which, mysteriously, is not explained, although it does have silica to remove stains. There's also a remineraliser called hydroxyapatite, plus xylitol to help prevent tooth decay and glycerin to moisturise. The SLS makes it unnecessarily foamy and potentially irritating. The natural peppermint oil and menthol are brilliant at banishing garlic breath, but you could just suck a sugar-free mint. Style over substance. 2.5/5 CHOCCY FIX FOR THE SUPER-RICH Theodent 300 Whitening Toothpaste, (EURO)159, www.fruugo.ie CLINICAL trials back up claims that this paste repairs enamel more effectively than fluoride, thanks to an extra-strength version of remineralising ingredient Rennou, made from a cocoa plant extract. It's safe to swallow, contains silica for stain removing, glycerin to moisturise and xylitol to reduce plaque. VERDICT: If I won the lottery, I might well enjoy the subtle chocolatey, minty flavour of this luxurious paste of a morning. You are required to double cleanse ? once to get rid of food, followed by a rinse, and then a second application to coat the teeth in active ingredients. The gold and white tube screams money. But (EURO)159 seriously? A high-performer eclipsed by its crazy price tag. 2/5 PUTTING ON THE GOLDEN GLITZ Splat Gold toothpaste, (EURO)12, www.splatoralcare.uk WITH diamond powder, gold, Royal Jelly and a 'Royal Mint' flavour, all this natural, fluoride-free paste is missing is Queen Elizabeth's royal warrant. It claims to offer 'luxury total care and whitening,' for VIPs. VERDICT: This translucent, pearly gold paste has a strong mint tang. Its main ingredient is calcium lactate, shown in studies to reduce tartar. Antioxidant grape-seed and Royal Jelly extracts are good for gums and I like that the maker has used rounded and smoother particles of silica to make stain removal less abrasive. My teeth did feel clean and polished, but the gem inclusions seem gimmicky. Blingy. 2.5/5 MEET THE MOUTH MOISTURISER MySmile by Dr Uchenna Whitening Toothpaste, (EURO)21.99, www.londonsmiling.com AFTER decades of giving celebrity smile makeovers on the TV show 10 Years Younger, Dr Uchenna has made a nourishing fluoride paste that claims to remove stains, protect the enamel and moisturise the gums, all wrapped in pretty recycled plastic packaging. VERDICT: This pearlescent cream is packed with active ingredients, including xylitol and hydroxyapatite, to protect against cavities without preservatives, fillers or foaming agents. With no drying SLS, this would be a great choice for menopausal women who already experience a dry or burning mouth. Most of all, my mouth felt moisturised after using this. It's like an anti-ageing serum for teeth. Worthwhile investment. 5/5 SEND YOUR PEARLY WHITES TO THE SPA Buly 1803 Opiat Dentaire Orange Ginger Clove, (EURO)17, www.buly1803.com AN ARTISAN toothpaste from a 19th-century brand, this has no harsh foaming ingredients such as SLS, but no active ingredients like fluoride, which would prevent decay. VERDICT: I loved the sophisticated botanical taste as well as the painterly plastic-free packaging. It's a treat that makes you want to spend time brushing. But I don't think my dentist would be too impressed if I told him I'd switched from my fluoride toothpaste to this concoction, which the makers say contains a fancy 'spa water reputed to ward off oral afflictions'. Pretty, but I worry it lacks protection. 2.5/5 LIKE CONDITIONER ? FOR YOUR TEETH Swiss Smile Pearl Shine Dental Conditioner, (EURO)92, www.swiss-smile-beauty.com IF YOUR enamel is damaged or your teeth are sensitive, this high-tech, fluoride-free mousse claims to coat teeth in tiny fragments of mother of pearl, with peptides and hydroxyapatite to heal and protect enamel for up to 16 hours and stop stains sticking. VERDICT: Like a hair conditioner, I applied this light, minty, no-rise foam after cleaning my teeth with my usual toothpaste. It gave a soft protective coat, which stayed on. Like all toothpaste, you spit out the excess, but you're not supposed to rinse it off ? this allows the active ingredients to keep working. However, the high percentage of SLS and alcohol means it could be drying, long term. A pricey add-on. 2/5 ARTISAN AROMAS as?YOU BRUSH Selahatin Escapist Whitening toothpaste, (EURO)20, www.selahatin.com A TOOTHPASTE inspired by the experience of the brand's Swedish founder who had a stroke in his 20s. Left paralysed with heightened senses, he wanted to create a toothpaste that became a ritual to change his emotional state at the beginning and end of the day. The result is a collection of four 'aromas' with poetic names in minimalist, recyclable, metal tubes. VERDICT: With sodium bicarbonate and silica to remove stains, as well as fluoride and hydroxyapatite to protect teeth, this minty, cinnamon and orange concoction has plenty of concentrated ingredients. Ads for High Street brands encourage you to load up your brush, but with this you only need a tiny bit as it's very foamy (it contains SLS). The aroma was pleasant and made you want to spend time cleaning. Brushing becomes me-time. 3/5"

BRUSSELS — The United States is hopeful that Ireland will drop its resistance to joining the global tax agreement that it is brokering, as Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen made the case to her Irish counterpart this week that it is in its economic interests to join the deal. During a weeklong trip to Europe, Ms. Yellen worked to gather more support for a global plan that is intended to put an end to tax havens and curb profit shifting with a new global minimum tax. The agreement, which gained the support of the Group of 20 nations on Saturday, would usher in a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent. It would also change how taxing rights were allocated, allowing countries to collect levies from large, profitable multinational firms based on where their goods and services were sold. “For Ireland, low taxes has been an economic strategy that has been incredibly successful,” Ms. Yellen said in an interview on Tuesday ahead of her return to Washington. “They see it as very vital to their economic success. And I think to go along with it, probably they need to be able to make the case that it’s in the interest of the country.” Ms. Yellen held high-stakes meetings in Brussels this week with Paschal Donohoe, Ireland’s finance minister and president of the Eurogroup, a club of European finance ministers. She needs Mr. Donohoe’s support because the European Union requires unanimity among its members to formally join the deal, which will require changes to domestic tax laws. After meeting with Ms. Yellen on Monday, Mr. Donohoe struck a positive tone and said he would continue to engage in the process. Despite growing global support for the deal, much work remains to be done. More than 130 countries have backed a framework of the global agreement, which would be the largest shake-up of the international tax system in decades, but important holdouts like Ireland, Hungary and Estonia remain. With stops in Venice and Brussels on her first trip to Europe as Treasury secretary, Ms. Yellen worked with her counterparts to develop a strategy for getting those countries to drop their concerns and join the agreement so that a final pact can be secured by October. Ms. Yellen told her Irish counterpart that Ireland’s economic model would not be upended if it increased its tax rate from 12.5 percent, noting that it would still have a large gap between its rate and the 21 percent tax rate on foreign earnings that the Biden administration has proposed. The Biden administration believes that the agreement, if enacted, will end the “race to the bottom” on corporate taxation, heralding a new era of corporate governance that will help nations finance new infrastructure investments and reduce inequality. Greater tax fairness could also aid in pushing back against the rise of right-wing populists, who have come to power around the world on a wave of frustration that working-class citizens have been forgotten by the elites. “Globalization is not just serving to enrich the rich further and harm the poor,” Ms. Yellen said. “In some broader sense the international tax piece is about that.” Top economic officials are working out complicated details of the global tax plan and will be scrambling to finish them in the coming months. One thorny issue that emerged at the G20 meetings in Venice last weekend was how tax revenue will be allocated around the world as part of a new tax on the largest and most profitable companies. Selling the agreement in the United States could be the biggest challenge. Congress is narrowly divided, and Republicans have been adamant that they will not support tax increases, giving the Biden administration a narrow margin for success even if it is able to pass most of its proposed tax changes with only votes from Democrats. Republican lawmakers have complained that the United States is “surrendering” its tax base by allowing other countries to impose new levies on its companies. For instance, in some cases, China will be able to collect new tax revenue from American businesses that sell products there. However, the United States will probably be able to collect taxes from some Chinese companies that do business in the United States. It is not clear if China would have a net gain from that part of the deal. Ms. Yellen portrayed the global tax as part of a broader economic reckoning that the Biden administration believes needs to happen in order to prepare the United States — and the rest of the world — for future fiscal needs. She pointed to the Biden administration’s tax plans, which include raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent, as central to that approach, saying the administration wants to address what she considers to be the unfairness of the tax code in the United States. “It just isn’t right for very successful companies to be able to avoid paying their fair share to support expenditures that we need to invest in our economy, to invest in our work force, in R.&amp;D. and a social safety net that’s operational,” Ms. Yellen said. Yet resistance is mounting from corporate America, with business groups warning that the possibility of $2 trillion in corporate tax increases would make American companies less competitive around the world. And with rising prices continuing to be a concern among policymakers in the United States, business interests have said the tax increases could fuel inflation, as companies pass them on to consumers. Ms. Yellen dismissed that theory, arguing that most of the economic research has found that corporate tax increases mostly fall on past investments and would not harm workers or lead to prices rising faster. “There’s no reason to think that changing corporate taxes would have some direct impact on prices,” Ms. Yellen said.

What a damnable thing. A dreadful way to decide a sporting contest. A shambles. Totally unfair. Trillick really did deserve to take the Tyrone county final against Dungannon to a replay. We are still banging on about it 10 months later, and rightly so. Sorry, what was that? Was there something else in the meantime? As it happens, only 16 miles separates where I park my tush here on this seat and the birthplace of the inventor of the penalty kick, William McCrum. This may not be news to many, but McCrum was an inheritor of millions from his father's linen company in Armagh - McCrum, Watson and Mercer. He togged out for Milford Football Club and in their first season in the Irish League they finished bottom, losing every one of their 14 games and scoring just 10 goals. As goalkeeper, McCrum picked the ball out of his net 62 times that year. And still he thought it worth his while to dream up another method by which he could be humiliated. His life story is a colourful adventure, almost a pulp fiction bodice-ripper in parts, involving six-figure gambling debts ran up in Monte Carlo, while his wife eloped with a Major Heard to the French Riviera in another event. With demons like that, no wonder he suggested the IFA might take up the idea of a 'penalty kick', which soon after was described as 'The Irishman's Motion', something that flew in the face of Victorian sporting conduct, but it was adapted all the same. As it was with Gaelic football and hurling. And ever since that day, the do-nothings and alickadoos haven't left the damn thing alone. Tweaks here, adjustments there. Only last week, Tipperary were awarded a penalty in hurling following a foul committed in a different townland. Of course, some alterations are necessary. Several years ago, the former Cork hurling goalkeeper Anthony Nash developed a means of scooping the sliotar high in the air so he could race in and steal yards before unleashing pile drivers. Waterford goalkeeper Stephen O'Keefe had other ideas in 2014 and ran off his line the moment Nash touched the ball. By the time he had got his strike off, O'Keefe was only three yards away. The bruise on his leg can be found online, a real hit with those who like to study rotting flesh. In Ulster, the most famous penalty of recent memory came almost 20 years ago. It helps that it was Armagh's Oisín Mc- Conville who missed it as i) he is capable of talking of it, ii) he scored a goal in the second half to make up for it and beat Kerry in the All-Ireland final, and iii) worse things have happened at sea. We put a call through to him this week, just to see how he feels about it after all these years. ""It might sound ridiculous, but the first thing I thought of was Bill McCorry,"" he said. ""Because he missed a penalty in 1953 (another All-Ireland final against Kerry that they lost), and that was all I had heard. ""But that's what I thought of. My uncle Gene Morgan played in that game in 1953. Bill Mc- Corry, by all accounts, was an unbelievable Gaelic footballer and he is only remembered for that one incident really. ""When people talk about Bill McCorry, they talk about the missed penalty. Paddy Moriarty also missed one in 1977 but nobody really talks about that because they were so well beaten."" As McConville made his way back into the changing rooms that day in 2002, his 19-year-old forward partner Ronan Clarke gave him a tap on the head but said nothing. Goalkeeper Benny Tierney had a quiet word, hissing at him to: ""Sort it out. Do something about it"". The team sports psychologist Des Jennings had an interesting thought. He told McConville to take a ball as he left the dressing room, go straight down to the Hill 16 goals where he would be shooting into for the second half and put it into the net before the game recommenced. ""I took a ball out with me and booted it into the air because I couldn't stand the embarrassment of doing what he had asked me to do,"" he recalled. For those who miss in big games, it clings to them. Dublin's Charlie Redmond missed penalties in the Leinster final of 1988 and All-Ireland finals of 1992 (Donegal) and 1994 (Down). Dublin lost all three. And yet McConville has no sympathy whatsoever for those who miss. ""I go back to some advice I got when I was 10, 11 or 12. There is a guy in Cross, Tim Gregory, who used to take us the whole way up through underage,"" he said. ""I remember missing a free one day and I was raging. He said, 'Listen, if you are going to take frees, you are going to miss some. If you can't handle that, then don't take them'. ""And that was something at a very early age that stuck with me. I missed frees during my career, some important ones. But you realise you are taking them because you are the best person to take them and you have to shrug it off. ""That's part of what you signed up for."" Man up, in other words. 'If you are going to take frees, you are going to miss some.

Gemini May 22 - June 21 Although it may seem wise to micro-manage a project, going with the flow could turn out to be much more productive. Over coming days a sterling aspect can coincide with lucky coincidences and vibrant possibilities. And an unexpected encounter may open up a whole new world to you. If you have patience and aren't too restless, getting to know them might be a wise move, Gemini. Leo July 24 - August 23 Tuning into the deeper currents within could help you to know what you want if you have more than once choice available. A dynamic focus on your sign can find you eager to pour your energy into something, but maybe uncertain what. A walk in peaceful surroundings away from too much hustle and bustle could still your active mind Leo, allowing the answers to bubble up. Libra September 24 - October 23 If you're after instant results, then you could feel it's not worth taking up an opportunity if the results are a long time coming. It might well be though, Libra. You may have to be patient, but you can find that like matured wine, an idea that requires careful nurturing could turn out to be one of your best successes. Taking the long view may see you enjoy other spin-offs from this too. Sagittarius November 23 - December 21 As lively Mercury forges a positive angle with jovial Jupiter you could benefit from good news, or even a release of funds that might go towards a household project, family trip or some other well-deserved personal cause. And if you haven't managed to enjoy any self-care lately, then someone may gift you a chance to unwind at a spa or encourage you to take a soothing break. Aquarius January 21 - February 19 Allowing yourself some time out where possible is not a luxury but a necessity. With both Jupiter and Saturn rewinding, the plans you had may be subject to delays, or you might be reviewing them. Rather than push on with a new crop of ideas, the coming weeks are perfect for taking stock and considering what makes you happiest both now, and over the long term. Taurus April 21 - May 21 A get-together or other event could be good for your soul, Taurus. The chance to chat and the topics discussed can gift you with several ideas of your own. But you'll also draw great comfort from being able to talk about anything and everything. Plus, you'll be motivated to try out new recipes or decorating tips at home, as a positive influence inspires your creative side. Cancer June 22 - July 23 Keen to zero in on something that gives you the feel-good factor? It could be a self-help book, an online course or the chance to connect with a mentor or teacher who can ramp up your belief in yourself. You may need just a little encouragement to boost your resolve. Are you contemplating doing something new? Don't worry if it doesn't pan out immediately. Take the long view Cancer. Virgo August 24 - September 23 Being in good company could be a restorative and might encourage you to do more socializing than you have. The idea of widening your circle of friends or joining groups of interest can connect you with others who share your ideas and goals. A meeting may be fortuitous, and you'll sense immediately that this is one connection which could develop into a strong bond, Virgo. Scorpio October 24 - November 22 Time to get away from it all? A sterling aspect can bring out your love of adventure and may be the inspiration behind a trip. Mercury in Cancer could bring memories to the surface, and you might feel an urge to visit a place you used to live or that holds fond memories. While things will have changed, they may have changed for the better, and new treasures could be uncovered. Capricorn December 22 - January 20 While you could put financial concerns ahead of your enjoyment, the same may not be true today when a sterling aspect between Mercury and exuberant Jupiter can see you ready to kick back and do something exciting. A trip to a place that rejuvenates you might be very welcome. You may return feeling energized, and discover something of real interest along the way, Capricorn. Pisces February 20 - March 20 Getting along with someone really well? Perhaps you can't get enough of them, Pisces. As Jupiter forges a lovely aspect, this can be a sign of positive developments you'll warm to naturally. If you have romantic feelings, be prepared to take your time. You may start out as friends, then progress from there. Want to collaborate? It could be a success for both of you."
