1,The Irish Times,03/04/2008,"""I have never received a corrupt payment and I have never doneanything to dishonour any office""","FULL STATEMENT by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern Government Buildings, Dublin April 2nd, 2008. I HAVE been privileged to serve my community, my party and our country for many years in public life. In that period, I am proud to have made a contribution to an unrivalled era of peace, prosperity and progress on this island.   Any achievements I have accomplished I share with the many people who have stood with me and behind me. I am grateful to so many people who have over the years given generously of their time and effort and shared my commitment to public service and building a fairer, stronger Ireland. At the outset today, I want to thank my family, who from the earliest stages supported me and always encouraged me throughout my journey in public life. My motivation for entering politics in 1977 was to represent the people of my constituency; throughout my political life my greatest honour has been to represent them in Dáil Éireann. I have been elected 10 times in those 31 years by the people of Dublin Central. I want to give special thanks to my constituency organisation. Their unprecedented commitment and friendship has never wavered. They have come with me, through good times and bad times, and for that I am very grateful. Today, I thank all of those who have canvassed for me in election after election. I particularly recall those friends no longer with us but whose memories will always stay with me. Today I also want to say that I am humbled to have been entrusted for over a decade with the great responsibility of leading our nation. The Irish people are innately decent and I have been privileged to serve them and to enjoy tremendous support. I especially wish to acknowledge all those people who took the time to pray for me, to send me Mass cards and letters of goodwill. As a political leader, I always took great encouragement and solace from such support. In November 1994, I was elected leader of Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party. This was for me and my family an extraordinary honour. To follow in the footsteps of de Valera, Lemass and those other giants of this nation's history was both a daunting prospect and an historic opportunity. Almost 14 years on, I am today Ireland's second-longest serving Taoiseach and the second-longest serving leader of Fianna Fáil. I believe the secret of Fianna Fáil's enduring success is rooted in the quality of people that we have as public representatives. I have been privileged to work with patriotic and decent colleagues and I will always be grateful for the faith they placed in me. I want to thank all of my Fianna Fáil ministerial colleagues, our parliamentary party and all our councillors for their incredible support, overwhelming loyalty, and most of all their friendship which has sustained me throughout my period as Uachtarán Fhianna Fáil. Beyond our elected representatives I also want to pay tribute to the members of the Fianna Fáil National Executive and our party members in every cumann across the length and breadth of this country for whom I have a lasting respect. These ordinary patriotic men and women have been an inspiration to me. Their commitment and loyalty to our party is unmatched and I believe was a decisive factor in last year's general election. Election 2007 demonstrated Fianna Fáil's continuing strength and vitality as a national movement. I want to thank the tens of thousands of members and activists up and down the country for delivering that historic success. I am proud to be the first Taoiseach since 1944 to be elected on three successive occasions. On the day I took over as leader of Fianna Fáil, I pledged to lead our party back into government and keep us there. I said then that I would strive to build up our economy. Today Ireland is more prosperous than at any time in our entire history. All levels of Irish society have seen their wellbeing dramatically improved in the period I have served as Taoiseach. Above all else, I promised that day that the priority I would put above all others would be to work for peace on this island. I kept my word and I have given my all to that cause. Through painstaking negotiations, colossal work has been done in laying the foundations of reconciliation and justice between the communities in Northern Ireland. The cycle of hatred and violence which many people thought might never end has been well and truly broken. The Good Friday agreement now provides the political framework for an island that can at last achieve its full potential. This week and next week, many of those who a decade ago played a role in negotiating that historic accord will gather to reflect on the work which was done and the progress which has since been made. In preparing for the events to mark this anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, I've obviously reflected back on the road we have travelled from discord to peace, from distrust to partnership and from despair to a new prosperity, North and South. I have also taken this opportunity to take stock of my own position. At the end of this month, I will visit Washington to address the Joint Houses of Congress. It will be a great privilege to become only the fourth ever visiting statesman to have addressed both Congress and Westminster. For me, this will be one of the proudest moments of my political career. In looking back on all the things I wanted to achieve in politics, I am proud that as Taoiseach I have delivered on my objective to bring the peace process to fruition; delivered on my objective to see a stable administration based on the powersharing model take root in Northern Ireland; delivered successive social partnership agreements which underpin our social and economic progress; delivered a modern economy with sustainable growth in employment and brought an end to the days of forced emigration; and delivered on my objective to improve and to secure Ireland's position as a modern, dynamic and integral part of the European Union. As leader of Fianna Fáil, I am proud too that I have ended the myth that Fianna Fáil is incapable of sustaining a coalition government. I have led the two longest-serving coalitions in the history of this State. I have also laid the foundations for another long running and successful coalition government which has the capacity to run a full term. I have the utmost respect for John Gormley, Mary Harney and their respective parties who continue to work hard to deliver a strong and stable government and implement our agreed programme for government. I also wish to acknowledge the steadfast support from Independent deputies who have supported me in government. Just as stability is important in a coalition government, it is even more vital within a political organisation. I always said that there would be no room for factions in Fianna Fáil under my leadership and I am proud today to lead a strong and united party. A strong, united party working within a cohesive government underpins stability and means the primary focus of government is on performance, not on any other external distractions. It is a matter of real concern to me that the important work of government and party is now being overshadowed by issues relating to me at the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. The constant barrage of commentary on tribunal-related matters has and I believe will continue to dominate the political agenda at an important point for our country. We face uncertain economic times and challenges and we are soon to cast our vote on the Lisbon Treaty. The vital interests of Ireland demand that the national dialogue of our political system address these fundamental issues and not be constantly deflected by the minutiae of my life, my lifestyle and my finances. The decision I am announcing today - like all other decisions that I have taken in a lifetime in politics - is solely motivated by what is best for the people. I have been reflecting on pursuing this course of action for some time. This is solely a personal decision. I have no doubt that a simplistic analysis will suggest that my decision has been influenced by most recent events at the tribunal. What I announce today is completely inspired by the desire to refocus the political dynamic in Ireland. Recent developments have not motivated my decision. For the record, I state today that nothing could be further from the truth. I look forward to comprehensively dealing with these matters at the tribunal and robustly refuting any imputation against me. I first sought election to the office of Taoiseach on the pledge that I would put people before politics. I have kept that promise. I have always placed the interests of the Irish people above my own. Therefore I will not allow issues relating to my own person to dominate the body politic as this would be contrary to the long-term interests of the Irish people. I want everyone to understand one truth above all else. Never, in all the time I have served in public life, have I put my personal interest ahead of the public good. I have served this country and the people I have the honour to represent in Dáil Éireann honestly. I have provided more details about my personal finances than any person in public life who has ever held office. While I will be the first to admit that I have made mistakes in my life and in my career, one mistake I have never made is to enrich myself by misusing the trust of the people. I have never received a corrupt payment and I have never done anything to dishonour any office I have held. I know that some people will feel that some aspects of my finances are unusual. I truly regret if this has caused any confusion or worry in people's minds. All of these issues arose in a period when my family, personal and professional situations were rapidly changing and I made the best decisions I could in the circumstances in which I found myself. I know in my heart of hearts that I have done no wrong and wronged no one. I look forward to the completion of the tribunal's work and I am confident that when it reports, the tribunal will find that I have not acted improperly in anyway. Equally, I will not allow issues concerning myself or my finances to divert attention from the important job of government at hand. I believe it is in the best interests of the Government, my party and most importantly the people of Ireland that I set out the time-frame for my departure from office. It had always been my intention to review my position as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil in the aftermath of next summer's local and European elections. But having reflected on the need to ensure that the work of my ministerial colleagues is not distracted from by incessant publicity about the tribunal, I have decided of my own volition to bring forward the date. I will complete my duties over the course of the next month and, following on from my return from the United States and the state visit to Ireland by the prime minister of Japan, it is my intention to tender my resignation to President McAleese on Tuesday, May 6th. On that date, I will also tender my resignation as Uachtarán Fhianna Fáil. In the meantime, I will continue to discharge my duties as Taoiseach to the best of my ability, and to work as hard as I have always done to secure the continued peace and prosperity of the island of Ireland. ""I have no doubt that a simplistic analysis will suggest that my decision has been influenced by most recent events at the tribunal.

2,The Irish Times,10/12/2020,'A perplexing year': Experts' views on 2020,"Marian Finnegan  managing director residential, Sherry FitzGerald  2020 has been a perplexing year in terms of housing. The year began with a notable boost to demand, potentially underpinned by positive news on Brexit. The onset of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown naturally slowed activity from March to June. However, once the branch network reopened on June 8th, we saw an uplift in demand for all property. Properties that had fallen through during the lockdown were re-agreed, and in most instances over the asking price.  Despite the fallout from the pandemic, residential property prices have demonstrated a remarkable degree of resilience. Prices have been underpinned by the release of pent-up demand following the spring lockdown and by the ongoing supply-side crisis, which has been exacerbated by Covid-19. Buyer sentiment remains firm, evidenced by the record high level of mortgage approvals recorded in October. Over the course of the year we saw modest price inflation return, with the rate of price growth currently at its strongest level in over two years. The Covid-19 pandemic is reshaping buyer demand in the Irish housing market. Demand is very robust for family homes in well-located areas, with the most valued attributes being space, access to a park, garden and a home office. A shift toward more remote working has also boosted demand for houses in ""walk-in"" condition, which are attracting a premium in the current climate due to increasing costs of construction works/scarcity of suppliers. The ""starter home"" to mid-market value properties have also seen strong growth, reflecting pent-up demand from first-time buyers and savings from the enhancement to the existing Help-to-Buy relief. If I had one wish for housing in 2021, it is that all stakeholders would listen to alternative perspectives and work together to develop much more collaborative and imaginative solutions to deliver decent and affordable homes for all our people. Keith Lowe  managing director, DNG DNG, like many agents, is recording particularly high levels of sales recently, especially for homes priced over EUR 1 million.   A surprise in an extremely difficult year, it's a reassuring show of confidence in the market. However, these recent elevated sales levels belie the fact that there will be 25 per cent fewer houses sold this year than last. Property prices fell 3 per cent during the first lockdown in Q2, but recovered quickly by slightly more than that by the end of Q3. This can be explained by pent-up demand from a large cohort of buyers. New homes sales and prices have remained constant with the exception that more schemes are being sold to private rented sector buyers for long-term rental and social housing, leaving less homes for individual buyers.  Covid-19 has had a very real effect on peoples' lives and attitudes. The experience of living in a confined space with no gardens took its toll. Likewise, empty-nesters in large houses decided to ""right-size"". Others moved from urban areas as working from home became a genuine option. Large numbers of Irish nationals returned home.  We can expect a sharp rise in buyers purchasing residential properties for investment as those with significant savings start to be charged negative interest rates from their banks for monies on deposit, a move unprecedented in Ireland. The number of house sales next year should recover to 2019 levels, which is still very low by international standards. A cohort will continue to hold off until they feel it is safe. New homes construction numbers will surpass 2020 levels and are likely to hit 25,000 units in 2021, with many being bought by long-term investors rather than homeowners. However, I would anticipate that the balance will start to reverse back to home-buying from 2022 onwards. Stephen Day  director, Lisney   Covid-19 hit brought complete uncertainty and a general consensus that the market together with the economy was due a major shakedown. Those who renegotiated sale prices fared well as sellers were rightly nervous they might not secure a sale down the line and proceeded at a discount. Equally, purchasers were nervous they would not secure finance for the same amount or at all. Once restrictions eased there was a significant uptake across all sectors of the market, especially at the upper end where buyers were prepared to throw the kitchen sink at buying the right family home. Any property with a view or a large garden was snapped up. A consistent theme has been the large influx of London buyers looking to relocate home. Covid seems to have accelerated five-year plans to return. Areas that have seen the most growth are along the coast. Traditionally, Dublin 4 would outpace Monkstown and Sandycove. Not in 2020. Lisney estimates that 80 per cent of all residential transactions above EUR 2.5 million are cash buyers. We would expect the first six months of 2021 to remain strong, even though considerably more stock should come to the market. The latter six months of 2021 may see minimal growth as buyers will be satisfied by more supply. The market remains price-sensitive, and the properties quoting the most realistic asking prices continue to garner the most attention and achieve the best prices.  TJ Cronin  vice-president, Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) The resilience of the property markets and the adaptability of the people working in the sector have been key takeaways this year. Despite predictions that property prices would drop significantly, they have held up well, with less than 10 per cent of deals being renegotiated in lockdown one. Demand for new and second-hand properties far exceeds supply.  Of course, the shift to home working has led to a noticeable increase in the demand for suitable properties - home office, good broadband, nice gardens etc - from purchasers moving out of larger urban areas as well as people returning from abroad. This trend has led to increased activity all over the country, and it looks set to continue. But lack of supply - some of it caused by people deferring decisions to trade up or down - and the impact of lockdown two has led to a decline in activity in recent weeks.  We need to address the lack of supply as a matter of urgency, which is why the SCSI has called on the Government to embark on a major public sector housebuilding programme led by local authorities. This would help get annual house completion figures up to the 30,000 to 35,000 units required while also taking advantage of the softening in construction costs caused by Covid-19.  Affordability is a major issue and we would like to see the establishment of a commission on housing - as set out in the Programme for Government - to review issues such as the high costs of servicing land, utility connections as well as the tax treatment of new housing. VAT makes up 12 per cent of the total cost of a new home here, while in the UK there is no VAT on new houses. Barring major economic shocks - from third and subsequent waves and a no-deal Brexit - most of the chartered agents I've spoken to believe the property market should remain relatively steady, with some slight reductions in the first half of 2021 followed by a levelling-off or modest price increases in the second half of 2021. David Cantwell  director, Hooke & MacDonald  The move away from city living is greatly exaggerated. It's a temporary phenomenon to a large extent. It became necessary for many people due to Covid restrictions and will remain so for some people, but the vast majority have a desire to return to being close to places of work, leisure and social contact.  Early indications are that this will become increasingly evident in the year ahead, with enquiries for apartments already increasing in city locations for rental and purchase. The biggest constraint is build cost viability. While the first half of the year was negatively impacted by the Covid lockdown, the second half witnessed buyers coming out in force, with first time buyers to the fore and making up almost two-thirds of all purchases. Shortage of stock was the main problem. It was interesting to see that, although three-bedroom houses were in most demand, four-bedroom houses increased in popularity, mainly due to the desire of some people to be able to use the fourth bedroom as a home office/study. Prices for new homes remained fairly static despite all the additional build costs caused by ever-increasing compliance regulations. The construction industry reacted very well to the changing scenario, implementing extensive site safety regulations and yet achieving end-of-year completions of nearly 20,000 new homes, contrary to most predictions. It was good to see the continued success of the private rental sector (PRS) investment market as well as the expansion of the Approved Housing Bodies' acquisitions and build programmes. Both are vital for supply of stock, mainly apartments, into the rental market. They also provide vital infrastructure for the country for the next 50 years and more. The outlook for the residential market in 2021 is very promising, especially for the new homes sector, with first-time buyers likely to be very active, and with completions likely to exceed 23,000 homes. While still short of demand, it would represent an outstanding recovery considering all the delaying factors of the past year. Pat Davitt  chief executive, IPAV The pandemic and lockdown made 2020 unusual, but in terms of property it was a predictable one, with stock scarce, many purchasers self-financed and buying without recourse to a mortgage, interest rates as low as they have ever been, and more competition in the mortgage market. All the ingredients needed to keep the market trading and buoyant were there.  It's unfortunate that the Central Bank still believes in a one-cap-fits-all approach with its macro prudential mortgage lending rules. These rules are preventing lower-paid workers in particular from acquiring a home even though they could afford to repay a mortgage. Such people will likely never own a property and unless governments into the future make major changes to our national pension policy, they will have to continue renting into pension age and then, potentially, even face homelessness.  It should be a source of outrage that young people are forced to pay substantially more in rent over the cost of servicing a mortgage.  When the Covid-19 ban on evictions expires there will be rent increases. As time moves on and institutional landlords gain more of a foothold in the rental market, tenants will see few advantages. Decisions impacting rents will be made far away from Ireland. If the pandemic passes and we don't hit another bump on the road, property prices, I believe, will increase in 2021, possibly by as much as 5 to 10 per cent. The after-effects of the Brexit bump will be positive for the Irish property market. We have an undersupply of property and, regardless of what economists and bankers say, the old story of supply and demand is what determines prices, not wild predictions such as those we saw earlier in 2020.  We will see more applications for mortgages and hopefully home ownership rates going up again. More stock will slowly come back to the market as property owners affected by Covid payments come back to work and can afford again to draw down mortgages and move on with their lives. The announcement that Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) will give bigger loans to smaller developers, having secured agreement from the European Investment Fund which will guarantee half the credit risk, is bound to help with new stock.  Angela Keegan  managing director, MyHome.ie This time last year, no one could have predicted what was in store for 2020, yet ironically the same old issues of supply and demand are dominating the market regardless. Clearly, Covid-19 has reduced the supply of housing, as construction activity stalled for most of Q2 and anxious vendors held off on selling. This led to rising prices as homebuyers' commitment to purchasing remained buoyant.  Meanwhile, interest in the market is at an all-time high, with traffic on MyHome.ie hitting unprecedented levels during the lockdown. Interestingly, we saw rising prices replicated in most middle- and high-income countries as the pandemic took hold - the G7 saw an annual house price increase of 5 per cent in Q2.  This happened for three reasons: central banks have cut interest rates, making it easier to borrow money; governments have preserved household incomes with a range of income supports, furloughs and subsidies; people want more from their homes as they prioritise remote working, and they are willing to pay for it.  Across Ireland, we are seeing evidence of the increased trend in remote working as people move away from cities and towards attractive rural areas. Searches for ""cottages"" have doubled year on year. Meanwhile, searches in tourist hotspots have soared. For example, in west Cork property searches are up by 500 per cent, searches for property in Kerry are up threefold, while Wicklow searches have doubled. The early part of 2021 will clearly be dominated by concerns over supply and demand, while we will continue to see changing home preferences as more people opt to work from home on a regular basis. The full economic impact of Covid-19 has not yet hit, so it will be interesting to see how the Government continues to support the economy.  The sooner the coronavirus vaccine is rolled out the better it will be for all sectors of the economy - including the property market. Then, we can hopefully start to see sustained construction activity and a redress of the balance between supply and demand. Guy Craigie  director, Knight Frank  The biggest surprise for both residential and new homes departments has been the level of overseas interest, particularly from Irish emigrants returning home but also from wealthy international buyers looking for a base in Ireland. Last year 13 per cent of our total sales were to this cohort compared to almost 25 per cent in 2020.  Following our Prime Global Cities Index for Q3 2020 showing a 0.3per cent fall in prime Dublin property prices in the three months to September, we believe prices have now stabilized. Looking forward we expect modest growth into the early part of 2021 as supply continues to outweigh demand and mortgage approvals remain at an all-time high. With the roll out of a vaccine imminent, we predict the supply of second hand homes to improve towards Easter next year, particularly as downsizers who may have been cocooning come back to the market.  New homes sales levels were well behind a normal spring market with buyers waiting to see what would happen to both property values and mortgage availability. As soon as in-person viewings recommenced in June we were met with a huge number of enquiries across all price points but particularly first time buyers looking to take advantage of the increased Help-to-buy rebates.  Whilst there had been predictions of values declining, we didn't experience any drop off and in fact the lockdown and subsequent construction delays further compounded an already under-supplied market.  Many developments have sold out and developers are releasing 2021 homes earlier to meet the demand.  Perhaps most interesting has been the strong demand for prime new homes, where we have agreed more than a dozen sales in the last quarter at values between EUR 1.5million and EUR 5million. A surprisingly resilient local market matched by the increased numbers of expats looking to buy in Dublin has fuelled this demand and we expect that to continue next year.",0,,,,,,
3,The Irish Times,07/12/2006,"'A platform on which to build a fairer, stronger Ireland'","Budget speech by Minister for Finance Brian Cowen INTRODUCTION As I present my third Budget to this House, I am delighted to report that Ireland's economy is strong. Growth is running at 5 per cent, its ideal, sustainable level. More than two million people are at work. We are making unprecedented investment in our infrastructure, investment that will enhance our competitiveness and improve our quality of life for years to come. Our public services are being expanded, improved and reformed. More doctors, teachers, nurses and gardaí are employed than ever before. At the same time, the public finances have never been in better shape. The success we enjoy now has been brought about by the hard work of our people, responding to the policies of this Government. The purpose of this Budget is to use that success as a platform on which we will continue to build a fairer, stronger Ireland. ECONOMIC CONTEXT In 2007, our country will extend its record of outstanding economic progress:  the economy will grow by 5.25 per cent;  we estimate that 72,000 new jobs will be created next year, representing a 3.5 per cent increase in the numbers at work;  unemployment will remain low at 4.4 per cent, among the lowest in the EU;  inflation, as measured on the harmonised EU basis, will moderate from 2.7 per cent on average in 2006, to 2.6 per cent in 2007. Of course, these projections are subject to some degree of risk from international factors, such as:  a possible, sharper than expected, downturn in the US economy;  a slower growth rate than is currently forecast in Europe;  further ECB interest rate increases, and  the ever present unpredictability of oil prices and exchange rates. There are also domestic risks of losing competitiveness and from unbalanced economic growth. This Budget addresses those risks by taking a long-term, sustainable approach to our economic management. The Government's primary economic aim has been to create more jobs and facilitate more business being done. The additional revenues generated by such a strong economy enable us to sustain ongoing improvements in our public services year in, year out. The success of our policies is best highlighted by the hundreds of thousands of new jobs created, and the changes to our tax policies which have rewarded work and allowed people take home a greater share of their pay. We have also been able to provide for the less well-off in ways which no Government has ever achieved before. We have built up the productive capacity of the country by investing in capital spending, thereby helping us to compete better in the long term also. At the same time that we have been doing all this, we have more than halved the national debt burden. That's responsible government at work. Our strategy has been remarkably successful by any measure. I believe that this is the firm foundation on which we can build in the future. 2006 has been an exceptional year for the public finances. It is true that, while tax revenues are well ahead, some of the buoyancy is due to one-off, windfall gains. Against this backdrop, we must firstly make sure that any increase in spending is used efficiently and effectively. We must continue to insist on value for money in public spending. Secondly, we must be careful not to inject so much spending that we create additional inflationary pressures and in so doing, reduce the impact of additional expenditure. I am not proposing that because we have extra resources we should spend it all now. That would be irresponsible and short-sighted. Responsible government involves finding the balance between meeting immediate priorities and making provision for future uncertainties. Of the additional resources at my disposal this year, I am returning some to the taxpayer, I am committing some to additional support in the social welfare and in the health areas, in care of the elderly and in improving services for the disabled. I am also using some of the additional revenue to run a very substantial Budget surplus. In the event of a global slowdown, we will be able to use some of this flexibility generated during the good times to protect jobs and public services at home. For these reasons, I am providing for the following fiscal targets in 2007:  a projected general Government surplus of 1.2 per cent;  an increase in gross current spending of 11.5 per cent;  an increase in gross capital spending of 13 per cent; and  a gross debt to GDP ratio of under 25 per cent, one of the lowest in Europe. Balancing responsibility with ambition has brought us to our present position of economic strength and this Government is determined to maintain that approach. It is the only means of prolonging and extending the best period of sustained economic growth in our country's history. REWARDING WORK Income Tax As I have said, Ireland's economic success is driven by the hard work and the collective efforts of the people. There is no doubt in my mind that our national economic potential has been boosted through a transformation of our tax system generally and our income tax system in particular, which has dramatically increased the rewards of work. During our 10 years in office so far: We have made our income tax system fundamentally fairer by introducing tax credits, widening tax bands and cutting tax rates; We have lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of the tax net; We introduced and increased the minimum wage and we have ensured that people on the minimum wage do not pay income tax; We have cut the income tax burden on average earners by more than half; We have removed the average wage from the higher tax rate; We have reached our target of 80 per cent paying an effective tax rate of no more than 20 per cent, and We have abolished many property-based and other tax relief schemes and introduced restrictions on the reliefs available to high earners as part of our continuing tax reform measures. We will continue to assess the role that time-limited tax relief schemes can play in supporting public policy objectives. In short, this Government has achieved a fairer, more progressive and more rewarding income tax system. Thanks to the strength of our economic performance, we can now go further. I wish to announce the following income tax changes to the House. Today, I am increasing the personal tax credit by EUR 130 to EUR 1,760 each year for single people and by EUR 260 to EUR 3,520 for married couples. I am increasing the employee tax credit by EUR 270 to EUR 1,760 per year. The entry point at which people will start paying income tax is being increased to EUR 17,600 per year, equivalent to over EUR 8.65 per hour. The employee PRSI entry point is also being increased to that level. These measures will remove around 88,000 from the tax net. Once again in 2007, we will meet our commitment to keep those on the minimum wage completely out of the tax net. This means that nearly two out of every five earners (or 846,000 persons) will be outside the tax net in 2007 compared to one-third (or 677,000 persons) in 2004 and one-quarter (or 380,000 persons) in 1997. This is a highly significant development. The cost of these measures is EUR 501 million in 2007 and EUR 657 million in a full year. The 20 per cent standard income tax band will be widened by EUR 2,000 per year to EUR 34,000 single and EUR 43,000 married one earner couples. The projected average industrial wage for 2007 is just over EUR 33,000. Again, we have ensured that workers on such earnings will not be liable to pay tax at the higher tax rate. This measure will cost EUR 268 million in 2007 and EUR 365 million in a full year. These increases in credits and bands mean that 80 per cent of income earners will continue to pay an effective tax rate of no more than 20 per cent. I am also increasing the threshold for the payments of the health levy from EUR 440 per week to EUR 480 per week, or just under EUR 25,000 per year. This means that all workers earning EUR 480 or less per week will be exempt from the health levy. The income tax exemption limits for senior citizens aged 65 and over are being raised from EUR 17,000 and EUR 34,000 to EUR 19,000 and EUR 38,000 per year respectively for single and married persons, removing a further 9,000 from the tax net. This means that our senior citizens will be exempt from income tax if they earn less than EUR 19,000 single or EUR 38,000 married per year. There are a number of other tax credits affecting certain people because of their particular circumstances which I propose to increase. Widowed persons currently receive an additional tax credit of EUR 500 per year. I am increasing it by 10 per cent to EUR 550 in 2007. There is also a special tax credit given to widowed parents in each of the five years following the year of bereavement. I believe that widowed parents deserve greater support during these difficult years and I am increasing the credit by EUR 650 in each of the five years after the year of bereavement. The increased tax credit will range from EUR 1,750 in year five to EUR 3,750 in year one. There is also a special tax credit for people who care for an incapacitated child. In 2007, I am doubling this tax credit from EUR 1,500 to EUR 3,000 each year. Regarding the blind person's tax credit, it will go up by EUR 260 single and EUR 520 married to EUR 1,760 single and EUR 3,520 married per year, respectively. Finally, alongside the income tax age exemption limits there is an extra tax credit for those aged 65 and over. This extra tax credit will increase by 10 per cent to EUR 275 single and EUR 550 married per year. These measures relating to exemptions and special credits will cost over EUR 88 million in a full year. In relation to tax rates, when we came to office, we made a commitment to the Irish people to reduce the marginal rate of income tax from the then 48 per cent to 42 per cent. We delivered on that. We also said we would reduce the top rate further to 40 per cent if economic circumstances permitted. We believe that the economic circumstances are sufficiently buoyant now to enable me to reduce the top rate of tax from 42 per cent to 41 per cent today. This rate cut will cost a net EUR 125 million in 2007 and a net EUR 186 million in a full year. If this Government is returned to office, then on the basis of our current economic strength being maintained, it is our shared intention to complete the commitment to cut the top income tax rate to 40 per cent in next year's Budget. I propose to increase the health levy from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent on income exceeding EUR 1,925 per week or just over EUR 100,000 per year. This extra money will help fund services such as long-term care initiatives for the elderly. We need to act now to secure such funds and I believe it is only right that those best able to afford it make an increased contribution. This will raise EUR 34 million in a full year. Taken together, these changes will reward work and increase disposable income. They will help workers, most obviously those on low and middle incomes and will, I believe, be welcomed by all. The full year cost of all these income tax measures is estimated at just over EUR 1.25 billion. Helping Taxpayers Claim Of course, it is not just a matter of providing additional tax reliefs for the ordinary taxpayer. The taxpayer must also be helped by making it as easy as possible to get access to tax reliefs. We have already made strides in this regard by giving mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief at source via the banks, building societies and health insurers. However, there are other areas where getting access to reliefs can be improved, especially in the area of various expenses reliefs. Accordingly, the Revenue Commissioners will be putting in place measures specifically to help the taxpayer, in addition to the major publicity campaigns already undertaken to make taxpayers more aware of their entitlements. In 2007, all age-related tax credits will, where possible, be credited automatically to the taxpayer, where a verified date of birth can be established through Revenue and social welfare records. Credit institutions will be enabled to operate Dirt-free accounts for those aged 65 and over and for those who are permanently incapacitated, where their income falls below the relevant income tax limits. At the moment, both categories of depositor have to reclaim the Dirt paid in such cases. In 2007, Revenue will also implement a system to credit tax relief on trade union subscriptions automatically, based on trade union membership lists, and will be engaging with the unions to make the necessary arrangements in respect of their members. For 2008, Revenue plan to move, where possible, to automatic repayments in respect of certain hospital and other expenses that qualify for tax relief. Tax relief due on medical insurance paid by employers that has been subject to benefit-in-kind taxation will be automatically included in the employee tax credit. I have asked Revenue to progress work on applying similar procedures in due course to nursing home and other medical expenses that qualify for tax relief. Revenue will explain the details of these simplification measures later this week. The Government is determined to make it easier for ordinary taxpayers to claim and receive their rightful entitlements. PROMOTING ENTERPRISE AND INNOVATION Ireland has become one of the world's most enterprising economies to the benefit of all. More jobs, better opportunities, improving prospects and greater tax resources have been the results so far. I want to see that development continuing so that the people of this country can face with confidence an increasingly competitive global marketplace. I want to see the State encouraging Irish businesses to work smarter, to pursue excellence and to invest in innovation and creativity for the future. The Budget measures I am announcing today will encourage enterprise, incentivise innovation and promote competitiveness in Irish industry. They will help position our businesses for long-term success. Supporting Growing Businesses Over the past 10 years, we have refocused the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) and Seed Capital Scheme to ensure that they channel funds to help transform and modernise our small business sector and improve our national competitiveness. These schemes are due to expire on December 31st and have been specifically reviewed at my request. Hundreds of small businesses using these schemes were consulted and asked for data and for their views on the schemes. Many of these firms using BES are ordinary, small to medium-sized manufacturing companies in various parts of the country. They make a vital contribution to job creation and to maintaining our competitiveness. On foot of this review, and the suggestions of groups such as the Small Business Forum, I am announcing an extension of these schemes for a further seven years and I am raising the ceiling per company on total BES investment from EUR 1 million to EUR 2 million. The annual limit on BES investment per investor, which has not been increased since 1984, is being raised from EUR 31,750 to EUR 150,000. In the case of the Seed Capital Scheme, the annual investor limit is being increased to EUR 100,000. I am increasing these limits in order to bring vital risk capital to the small business sector. As these schemes are approved State aids, their continuation and the changes proposed will require the approval of the European Commission. The full-year cost of these measures is estimated at just over EUR 25 million. With a view to fostering new companies and entrepreneurs, during the course of this year, I approved a proposal for a new round of seed and venture capital funding, announced by my colleague Micheál Martin. This will involve a EUR 175 million State investment through Enterprise Ireland over a period of 10 years. It is often pointed out that much of the dynamism of an economy comes from small firms and there is a real need for small companies to make use of innovation and modern technology to maintain competitiveness. To help bring that about, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has announced a provision of EUR 5 million in 2007 for innovation vouchers, knowledge acquisition grants, and ICT audits, all of which were recommended by the Small Business Forum. Helping Small Businesses Small businesses are a major source of employment and growth in this country. There are approximately 250,000 small businesses in Ireland today, employing almost 800,000 people, or 40 per cent of the workforce. Recognising their important contribution and their development potential, I am pleased to announce the following package of measures aimed at reducing the administrative burden on this important sector. Small companies whose corporation tax liability is currently less than EUR 50,000 can pay preliminary tax, based on their previous year's final tax liability. This removes the need for small businesses to forecast their projected full-year performance prior to the end of their accounting year. To alleviate further the burden on small business, I am increasing the small company liability threshold from EUR 50,000 to EUR 150,000. Over 97 per cent of Irish companies will have the benefit of the simpler and more straightforward system. It will help them to get on with their business without putting the State's own cashflow at risk; I am also introducing measures proposed by Revenue whereby new start-up companies will not have to pay preliminary tax in respect of their first accounting period. In addition, I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to explore further opportunities to reduce the tax compliance burden on all firms, large or small; The annual VAT cash accounting threshold for small firms is being raised from EUR 635,000 to EUR 1 million from March 1st, 2007, so as to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements. This allows smaller firms to pay VAT on receipt of payment rather than at the time a sale is made; The small business VAT registration turnover thresholds are being increased from EUR 27,500 per year for services and EUR 55,000 per year for goods to EUR 35,000 and EUR 70,000 respectively from March 1st, 2007. This measure could take up to 8,000 businesses out of the VAT system and will considerably reduce their administrative burden; The frequency of VAT payments for smaller firms is being reduced from six VAT returns to three each year in some cases, and to two each year in other cases. This will provide a cashflow boost to firms and significantly reduce compliance costs, and The transaction threshold which triggers the requirement for a tax clearance certificate is being increased from the current EUR 6,500 to EUR 10,000. The details of all these measures are contained in the summary of Budget measures. The full-year cost of these measures is EUR 53 million, with an additional once-off cashflow cost in 2007 of EUR 124 million. This will reduce the regulatory burden and enhance the competitiveness of companies whose wellbeing is critical to our continued success. R&D Tax Credit I am also enhancing the existing R&D tax credit for firms so as to promote R&D spending in our manufacturing sector. Details are in the summary of Budget measures. We must act now to promote as many jobs as possible in the productive sector throughout the State. Investment in R&D is a key factor in retaining our manufacturing base. The special R&D tax credit seeks to encourage this and the changes I am making will further incentivise firms to engage in R&D. These improvements will cost EUR 70 million in a full year and complement Government spending on science, technology and innovation, which will increase from EUR 800 million in 2006 to EUR 900 million in 2007. Conferences In recent years, hotel and tourism bodies have made a strong case to introduce a VAT measure specifically for conferences, which will allow deductibility of accommodation expenses on a ringfenced basis. I am now bringing in such a measure which should greatly help that sector promote growth in the important conference business and benefit the entire country. This is in recognition of the importance of tourism, one of Ireland's largest indigenous industries. The details of the scheme will be set out in the Finance Bill. Sporting Bodies Sport plays a major role in all aspects of Irish life, both commercial and social. In recognition of this, there are specific income tax and capital gains tax exemptions already in the tax code for sporting bodies. I propose to include in the 2007 Finance Bill a similar exemption from stamp duty, where such sporting bodies purchase land for the purpose of promoting sports. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT Environmental Measures The environment is a concern for us all. But this concern is not addressed merely by announcing policies. It is a matter of practical measures, targets, and actions that have a real effect. It is also a matter of achieving a balanced impact on society. Ireland's economic success of recent years has brought with it environmental pressures through increased consumption levels, waste and energy demands. However, we have been working to minimise the impact of these pressures and enhance the quality of our environment. The recent Stern review in the UK highlighted that climate change is one of the most pressing global economic and environmental challenges we face. Ireland supports the international effort to address this challenge and is playing its part in the co-ordinated global response. We will meet our Kyoto target, mainly through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in our own economy, but also through contributing to the cost of projects to reduce emissions elsewhere in the world. The Government has indicated its intention to purchase up to 18 million tonnes of carbon allowances in respect of the Kyoto commitment period, 2008 to 2012. I provided an initial EUR 20 million in last year's budget and just recently the Dáil approved the investment of this money in emission reduction projects in the emerging economies in eastern Europe. I am now indicating that a further EUR 270 million will be provided to fund a programme of purchases up to 2013 and this will be reflected in the Government's medium-term investment programme to be set out in the forthcoming National Development Plan. This provision will be kept under review. The purchase of carbon allowances is just one part of the overall strategy. We will shortly complete an updated version of the National Climate Change Strategy. In more general terms, on the environment we have made progress on many fronts including: Enhancing public transport facilities under Transport 21; Setting an ambitious target of 30 per cent electricity generation from renewable sources; Making rapid improvements in drinking water quality; Significantly increasing high-quality waste water treatment capacity, resulting in 90 per cent compliance with EU standards this year from 25 per cent in 2000. As a result, pollutant loads to our waters have been reduced by 45,000 metric tonnes per year; Increasing municipal waste recycling rates from 9 per cent in 1998 to over 34 per cent and rising; Introducing a major excise relief scheme for biofuels, costing in excess of EUR 200 million over five years, and The Nitrates Action Programme will resolve the problem of water pollution from the over-use of phosphates and nitrates and will also reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We have allocated EUR 328 million in 2007 for the Rural Environment Protection Scheme. This includes provision for a new REPS 4 scheme, which will go to Brussels shortly for approval as part of Ireland's Rural Development Programme for the period 2007-2013. The new scheme will include additional biodiversity elements and new supplementary measures designed to deliver further benefits to water quality and the wider environment. Here again, we have the opportunity to translate our concern for the environment into practical action, in partnership with farmers. I am allocating an additional EUR 10 million to the Local Government Fund in 2007 in order to alleviate the pressure on certain local authorities most affected by the additional operational costs associated with new water services infrastructure. We depend on cleaner technologies to minimise our environmental footprint. Furthermore, eco-industries are big business. They employ more than two million people in the EU and are one of the fastest growing sectors in the union. Environmental protection and economic progress can go hand in hand. There are a number of measures I would now like to mention in the fiscal area which I am bringing forward. Environmental Taxation In the case of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), I intend to change the current rating system to relate it more closely to environmental policy objectives, in this case reducing carbon dioxide emissions. I intend that there should be some reward in the VRT system for choosing lower-emission vehicles, and that those choosing higher-emission vehicles should pay more. For that reason, I am setting out a range of options in the Budget booklet for making such a move. My department will carry out a public consultation process on these proposals before coming back to Government. Any changes will have effect from a target date of January 1st, 2008. At the same time, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will consult on his proposals for a complementary rebalancing of annual motor tax. This would provide a further incentive through the motor tax system for the motoring public to drive cleaner cars and would impose some additional cost in respect of cars with higher carbon dioxide emission levels. This would apply to vehicles registered on or after January 1st, 2008. Underpinning both of these initiatives will be a new mandatory labelling system for cars based on CO2 emission levels. Linking consumption taxes to environmental goals requires us to discuss the details of such moves thoroughly with stakeholders if we want to get it right. Energy In my last budget, I announced an excise relief scheme for biofuels. The relief is worth over EUR 200 million over five years. This initiative helps reduce our dependence on conventional fossil fuels, lowers CO2 emissions and stimulates new activity in the agriculture sector. In addition, the Government has also introduced grant schemes for new energy technologies at both the domestic and the commercial levels, amounting to EUR 65 million in the 2006-2010 period. Building on the renewable energy package, I introduced last year, I am making a number of further changes today. The Greener Homes Scheme has had a very positive response from the public. The scheme provides grants for the installation of new energy technologies such as biomass burners, heat pumps and solar panels. There have been about 10,000 applications so far. I am increasing the planned spend in this area by EUR 20 million between now and the end of 2009. In the commercial area, we introduced a bioheat scheme for grant-aiding, for example, wood pellet burners. I am extending this scheme to cover the installation of other technologies such as solar panels. I am also extending it to buildings in the non-commercial sector such as community centres, and sports facilities so that they will also be able to avail of the grants. The planned additional spending for the next year is EUR 4 million, partly funded by a reallocation of resources within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Better energy efficiency and demand management and initiatives pay significant dividends for business as well as households. I am providing additional funding to Sustainable Energy Ireland of EUR 3 million in 2007 to develop pilot programmes to support small and medium enterprises in assessing their energy usage and measures to enhance energy efficiency. Impacts of the pilot scheme will be reviewed during 2007. In regard to renewable energy, a scheme of tax relief is in place in the form of a deduction from a company's profits for corporate investment in renewable energy products in the solar, wind, hydro or biomass technology categories. This scheme was due to end this year. I propose to continue this corporation tax incentive for investment in renewable energy projects for a further five years, subject to EU approval. Agriculture - Energy Crops I am conscious that we are trying to establish a national biofuels supply chain, almost from scratch, and I think it is appropriate that we offer assistance at the various stages from crop establishment onwards. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will shortly announce, subject to any necessary EU approval, grant aid for the production of energy crops in three stages from establishment to harvesting. First, establishment grants will be introduced for willow and miscanthus where costs of establishment are very high and there is a wait of several years before harvesting can begin. Secondly, there will be a national top-up of EUR 80 per hectare, in addition to the existing EU premium of EUR 45 per hectare. And finally, there will be grant aid for the purchase of the expensive, specialised harvesting machinery needed. The cost of these three measures will rise to EUR 6 million in 2009. Excise on Kerosene and LPG As I announced in last year's budget statement, I am abolishing the excise on kerosene and LPG used for home heating from January 1st, 2007. This will reduce the incentive to source these fuels in Northern Ireland where no excise is applied. This measure will cost EUR 24 million in a full year. SUPPORTING FARMING AND THE RURAL ECONOMY A competitive farming sector is the key to developing a sustainable rural community. It is important that, as farmers are increasingly freed from the constraints of production quota and price supports, they are given the necessary assistance to enable them to invest and innovate and by so doing to be in an increasingly globalised market for farming produce. It is also important that such assistance is prioritised to young farmers and to those farmers who have risen to the challenges posed by changes arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and WTO negotiations. The package of rural development measures recently agreed with the farming organisations as part of Towards 2016 has been widely welcomed. It means that Government support for farming will more than double in the next rural development period compared to the present one. This is a time of great change in farming. New schemes of aid for restructuring in the food processing sector, while not directly involving farmers, provide an essential underpinning to adapting our agriculture and food sector to the new realities in EU and world farming. Increases of 15 per cent in forestry premiums and 17 per cent in REPS payments, as well as substantial support for on-farm investment to help meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive, reflect our growing concerns about the environment and our awareness of the important role that farmers now play in protecting our environment. In line with the changes announced in my previous two budgets and arising from the conclusion of the latest social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, I am renewing and extending a series of farm tax reliefs in the areas of income tax and capital taxes, at a cost of EUR 14 million in a full year. The two farm stock reliefs are being renewed. The general stock relief allows 25 per cent of any increase in stock values in a year to be allowed as a trading expense. For young trained farmers, the relief is set at 100 per cent. The stamp duty relief for farm consolidation, where two farmers exchange land, will now apply where only one farmer meets the consolidation criteria. The amount of the tax exemption for long-term leases of farmland is being increased to EUR 20,000 per annum for leases of 10 years or more duration. An exemption from capital gains tax applies to disposals of farmland outside the immediate family on retirement. The present threshold for the exemption is EUR 500,000 and this is being increased to EUR 750,000 from January 1st, 2007. In addition, where farmland that has been owned and worked by a farmer for over 10 years is leased for less than five years, and is subsequently disposed of to the person leasing the land, the present retirement relief will also apply. The last three changes are aimed in particular at encouraging the transfer of farm assets to younger and more progressive farmers. The various measures are detailed in the summary",0,,,,,,
4,The Irish Times,07/09/2018,"'Adverse shock' to economy inevitable, says council; Financial watchdog urges Government to run a small surplus in Budget 2019"," An ""adverse shock"" to the Irish economy from Brexit, Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies or changes to the international tax environment is now inevitable, the Government's financial watchdog has warned. In a pre-budget statement the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) also cautioned that while efforts to stabilise the public finances since the financial crisis have been successful, improvements in the Government's underlying budgetary position have stalled since 2015. This is despite a strong recovery in the economic cycle. As a result, it suggested an ""earlier-than-planned move"" to running a small budgetary surplus may be warranted, particularly if growth and tax exceed expectations this year. The council's warning echoes comments this week by Central Bank governor Philip Lane, who called for more financial resources to be set aside as a buffer against future economic shocks. Having targeted a budget surplus in 2018, the Government is still running budget deficits (spending more than it raises in revenue) despite having one of the highest debt burdens in the OECD. It is now not expected to achieve a surplus until 2020.  Ifac chairman Seamus Coffey told The Irish Times that almost all small open economies in Europe, with the exception of the Republic, were running budget surpluses, and ""those countries don't have the strength of growth that we have or the surge in corporation tax"".  Potential clouds  ""If they're managing budgetary surpluses it's something we should be able to achieve too, particularly given the potential clouds on the horizon,"" Mr Coffey said, while noting that running a surplus would not preclude the Government from increasing spending on health or housing provided it raised revenue elsewhere.  On Brexit, the council said the ""size and nature of potential impacts"" from various scenarios were highly uncertain, and may not fully capture the extent of the Republic's and the UK's closely integrated supply chains. Mr Coffey said the impact of Brexit on the State had been modelled by the Department of Finance and others on the basis that it was a ""normal shock"" with a standard trading partner, but the UK was not a standard trading partner. He also pointed out that the Irish economic sectors most likely to be affected were the largest employers. Corporation tax  The council also warned that the highly concentrated nature of Irish corporation tax receipts means that substantial reductions in revenue could arise if even one large firm were to relocate its operations as a result of changes internationally, such as Donald Trump's reforms in the US.  About 40 per cent of receipts from the business tax, which generated a record EUR 8.2 billion last year, come from just 10 firms, leaving the State exposed to changes in the international tax environment. Ifac said that any unexpected increases in tax revenues or lower interest costs that arise this year or in 2019 should not be used to fund budgetary measures beyond those currently planned, and should be used to build financial ""buffers"" to cushion the economy against future downturns. It urged the Government to stick to its plan for a budget-day package for new measures of about EUR 800 million, which was in line with the economy's sustainable, long- term growth rate. ""There is no case for additional stimulus in 2019 beyond this.""  It said if the Government wanted to introduce additional spending measures ""these should be funded by additional tax increases or through reallocations of existing spending"".

5,The Irish Times,15/10/2008,'An opportunity for us all to pull together and play our part',"The Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan's Budget address Introduction A Cheann Comhairle, We find ourselves in one of the most difficult and uncertain times in living memory. Turmoil in the financial markets and steep increases in commodity prices have put enormous pressures on economies throughout the world. Here at home, we face the most challenging fiscal and economic position in a generation. This Budget sets out a plan to deal with this most unfavourable set of circumstances. The aim is to restore order and stability in the public finances, to increase productivity and competitiveness and to protect those who are most vulnerable in our country. This Budget seeks to secure the gains we have made in the last 15 years. Those gains have been substantial:  two million at work;  real improvements in living standards;  a more generous welfare system and  the biggest public investment programme in the history of the State. All these advances were made in the context of sound public finances and record levels of economic growth. The economic context has changed very dramatically and with great rapidity. We are confronted with severe budgetary pressures and negative economic growth. We face difficult choices. In making those choices, we will be guided by the principles of fairness, sustainability and affordability. By the decision to bring the Budget forward by two months, the Government has seized the initiative and provided political leadership in this time of changed economic realities. Today, I am setting out targets for the next three years. In that timeframe, we must take the necessary steps to bring order to the public finances. This will instil confidence in those at home and abroad, who want to invest in our economy. Fifty years ago, Seán Lemass set his generation the task of consolidating the economic foundations of our political independence. Our economic achievements, particularly over the last 20 years, have fulfilled his vision. The historical task facing us here today is to consolidate and build on that economic success. We will do this through sustainable, progressive and balanced policies that will create a fairer, more productive and competitive Ireland. Changed economic realities In his budget speech last December, my predecessor, now Taoiseach, referred to the significant uncertainty in the international economic environment as well as the slowdown in our construction industry. But nobody foresaw the speed with which the global and the domestic downturn would gather pace. In the past few months, the world financial system has been turned upside down. Household names in global finance have been rescued by governments and blue-chip companies have either failed or been subsumed into other institutions. A fortnight ago, when the stability of our own banking sector came under threat, the Government took bold and decisive action. On the advice of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, we put in place a guarantee arrangement to safeguard the financial system in Ireland. We did so to protect our economy and all who work in it and we are grateful for the support of the House in that endeavour. As a small, open economy, we are especially vulnerable to economic shocks beyond our shores. The international credit crisis has compounded and deepened the downturn in the construction sector and led to a fall off in consumer confidence. The rapidity and severity of this downturn has taken even the most pessimistic of commentators by surprise. The result is a sharp rise in unemployment and a steep decline in revenue, with businesses experiencing the kind of economic difficulties we have not seen in this country for over 20 years, although we are now in a better position to address those difficulties. The most recent data show that economic activity contracted in the first two quarters of this year. My department expects that GNP will decline by over 1&frac12; per cent this year, the first decline since the early 1980s. Throughout the world, economic forecasts have been revised downwards. The prospects in our main trading partners remain poor. In this context, the forecast of my department is that:  GNP will contract next year by 1 per cent, with GDP contracting by about &frac34; per cent;  unemployment will continue to rise, averaging 7.3 per cent for the year as a whole and  inflation will ease to 2.5 per cent on average for the year. We must remind ourselves that, even in this global downturn, Ireland continues to attract a disproportionate amount of all foreign direct investment into the EU. Scarcely a week goes by without an announcement of new investment in cutting-edge companies and new, high-value jobs for our graduates. The IDA is optimistic about the prospects in the year ahead. The Government is determined to retain and enhance Ireland's reputation as a pro-enterprise economy and as an attractive location for foreign direct investment. The most important action we can take in this regard is to stabilise our public finances. Order and stability in public finances Fiscal responsibility has been the cornerstone of our economic success. Fiscal responsibility has ensured:  a modest national debt burden;  a strengthened ability to deal with the financial and economic crisis now shaking the global economy and  a credible tax regime which incentivises work and investment. While the strength of the economy in the past decade has given us some room for manoeuvre, we cannot put our reputation for fiscal responsibility in jeopardy. We must take the right decisions now to put the budgetary position on a path to stability in the interests of everybody who lives and works in this country. A soft option of ignoring the budgetary challenge might prove popular in the short term. The soft option would have grave consequences for the future of this country. The soft option would risk all the economic and social advances we have secured in recent years. In framing this Budget, the Government faced a deficit of the order of about 8 per cent of GDP on the general Government balance unless decisive action was taken. As the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditureshows, we have reprioritised our spending focus as a Government. The opening position this afternoon is a reduction in the deficit to 7 per cent of GDP. This is a significant adjustment. Our approach has been to reduce public expenditure as much as possible on the current side and as much as is sensible on the capital side. The changes I am announcing in this Budget build on these decisions. This Budget will adjust the incidence and focus of taxation to those better able to contribute. This Budget will provide a social welfare package of EUR 515 million. As a result of these budgetary adjustments, the deficit will be about 6&frac12; per cent of GDP in 2009. I believe this is the maximum reduction that we can achieve in 2009. Our intention is to reduce it further. Our spending will be concentrated on our schools, our health services and on the protection of the elderly and the most vulnerable. We will continue to invest in our public services but, in a time of scarcer resources, the value for money principle becomes all the more imperative. A substantial increase in borrowing is unavoidable if we are to minimise the impact of the tighter fiscal position on the economy. Accordingly, the 2009 budgetary targets are as follows:  an increase in gross voted spending of 1.8 per cent;  a current Budget deficit of just over EUR 4.7 billion;  a capital Budget deficit of just under EUR 8.7 billion;  a General Government Deficit of just over EUR 12 billion or 6.5 per cent of GDP and  a debt to GDP ratio of 43 per cent. It is my intention to secure a progressive reduction in the deficit as a percentage of GDP in 2010 and 2011. The time for corrective action is now. By moving to restore stability, we will ensure that the Irish economy stands ready to benefit from the next global upturn. We are a small nation facing a major challenge in these uncertain times. We must all pull together if we are to return to more prosperous times. In July, the Government announced that Ministers and other senior public servants would forego pending pay increases recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration. Today, I wish to tell the House that members of the Government and Ministers of State will surrender 10 per cent of their current total pay. Officers at secretary general level in Government departments have volunteered to make a corresponding surrender in respect of their pay. Other public servants in leadership and senior positions may wish to consider whether it is appropriate for them to make a similar move in current circumstances. The Government has also decided to introduce an income levy at the rate of 1 per cent on all incomes up to EUR 1,925 per week or just over EUR 100,000 per annum and at the rate of 2 per cent on the balance of all income above that level. We realise the solidarity it demands of all taxpayers. But there is too much at stake: we all have too much to lose by not taking action now. This levy will allow all income earners to contribute in a proportionate manner to the restoration of order and stability to the public finances. This will enable Ireland to return as soon as possible to a natural level of economic growth. The levy will be kept under review in the light of economic conditions. I am conducting a review of the National Pension Reserve Fund in the context of recent economic and fiscal developments. It is my intention to complete this review before the end of the year. Any changes requiring legislation will be brought forward in due course. Current Government spending General policy In the past 10 years we have seen a huge increase in the public services financed by taxation. Day-to-day expenditure has risen by 200 per cent between 1998 and 2008. Spending on health has risen by 293 per cent. Education has increased by 174 per cent and social welfare by 200 per cent. Successive ministers ensured that the public received higher quality and more extensive public services. However, public spending can only increase in line with available resources. We must continue on a path of bringing spending into line with resources. There is no option. But in so doing, the Government is determined to:  safeguard key public services;  protect the vulnerable;  re-focus spending to enhance our productive capacity;  regain export competitiveness; l re-skill our labour force;  retain the substantial gains already made and  continue our work in building a fairer Ireland. This means doing more with existing resources, paring down administration to focus squarely on delivery of services to the public and prioritising our spending goals. That is why my predecessor as minister for finance announced an efficiency review of all public service spending in last year's budget. In July of this year, I implemented the findings of that initiative and other specific measures agreed by Government with the intention of achieving overall savings of EUR 440 million this year and EUR 1 billion in 2009 as a first step towards addressing the emerging difficult fiscal position. These savings included a 3 per cent cut in the public service payroll, a halving of expenditure on areas like advertising, public relations and consultancy and major savings from procurement reform. This initiative was just the beginning of the process, but it did send a strong signal of our firm intention to tackle the emerging fiscal difficulties. I am pleased to report that those savings have been achieved and that the payroll reduction intended to deliver EUR 190 million will in fact yield savings of EUR 260 million. The savings achieved have already been used to relieve pressures in areas such as:  health, where additional provision had to be set aside to meet the costs of a new consultants' contract and  education, where the full year salary costs of about 2,000 extra teachers and special needs assistants taken on this year had to be provided. Despite the challenging fiscal context, the Government will make significant allocations to social welfare, education and health. The Government has agreed that gross current spending in 2009 will grow by no more than 3.6 per cent. Within this overall figure,  spending on social welfare will grow by 8.4 per cent to EUR 19.6 billion;  Education will see an increase of 2.7 per cent to EUR 8.7 billion and  spending on health will increase by 2.1 per cent to EUR 15.8 billion. To accommodate these increases, gross current spending in other areas will require substantial reductions. The individual allocations for each vote for current spending are set out in the Budget documentation published today together with the main policy changes they require. Welfare/protecting the vulnerable Social welfare rate increases We are determined to protect the most vulnerable in our society and we will redirect resources to that end. Pensions I am happy to announce that the full personal rate of the State pension will be increased by EUR 7 per week for all pensioners. This will bring the State (contributory) pension to EUR 230.30 per week and the State (non-contributory) pension to EUR 219 per week. The qualified adult allowance rate for those of pension age will increase by EUR 6.30 to EUR 206.30 per week. Energy Costs We recognise the difficulties caused by fuel price increases to those on low fixed incomes. Accordingly, the duration of the fuel allowance is being increased by two weeks from next April, while the rate of payment is being increased by EUR 2 per week, to EUR 20 per week, with effect from January 1st. The aggregate period for the payment of fuel allowance will be increased from 30 to 32 weeks from April 2009. People of working age The personal rates of all working age payments, including both the carer's benefit and the carer's allowance, are being increased by EUR 6.50 per week from January 1st. This will bring the lowest full adult social welfare rate to EUR 204.30 per week. The minimum rate of maternity and adoptive benefit is being increased by EUR 8.50 to EUR 230.30 per week. Children We are also increasing the qualified child rate by EUR 2 to EUR 26 per week, and increasing the family income supplement thresholds by EUR 10 per week per child. The full-year cost of all these measures is EUR 515 million. Targeting resources Government policy is to target resources at those in greatest need. Universal entitlements irrespective of means do not target those in greatest need. I believe in some cases there is a need to differentiate between those who have and those who have not. I am proposing in the Budget this year to initiate action in this direction in some areas and to promote a wider debate in others. The Government has decided to abolish the automatic entitlement to a medical card for those over 70 who are above the eligibility criteria. Support will be available to this group to help them meet their healthcare costs. An annual cash grant of EUR 400 per person will be paid to those over 70 who do not qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card subject to an income threshold. The Minister for Health will give full details of this new arrangement which will come into force on January 1st, 2009. I fully expect that the Commission on Taxation will examine options relating to the tax treatment of universal child benefit payments. I look forward to giving careful consideration to any progressive proposals that they may make in this area. At this stage, the Government has decided to limit the entitlement to child benefit and to early childcare supplement. Child benefit payment will cease for 18-year-olds from January 2010 and will be halved for that group to EUR 83 per month from January 1st next. However, welfare recipients - including those on family income supplement - will be compensated through appropriate adjustments to their support payments. Early childcare supplement will cease at five-and-a-half years of age. The full details of these saving measures and the offsetting factors to assist welfare recipients are set out in the Summary of Budget Measures. The Minister for Education and Science has announced that he is undertaking a review on the appropriate student contribution to the substantial cost of third level education. Health services The OECD estimates that spending in Ireland on pension and healthcare may rise from about 8 per cent of GDP at present to about 18 per cent by 2030. We cannot sustain such a huge increase without basic changes in how we achieve our common goals. I am determined to secure savings on health-sector payroll and staffing numbers to provide for a greater concentration of available resources on the actual delivery of key primary and acute healthcare services. I want to see improvements in the operation of frontline services and an appropriate rebalancing of costs to provide a more sustainable basis for funding into the future. I will be working with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children to this end. The Government has agreed that the HSE will begin an innovative proposal to fast-track the rollout of new GP practice units in collaboration with the private sector, while retaining full HSE control of the units. The Minister will give further details of this initiative. Education Investment in Education is essential for our future prosperity. I have provided for an increase of EUR 308 million in the total expenditure provision for education in 2009. EUR 230 million of this increase is for current expenditure, to provide for the additional costs across the system as a result of increasing student numbers due to demographic factors. The challenges facing the education system will be demanding in the years ahead. I have done the utmost to protect this sector in the prevailing circumstances. We have provided the maximum possible additional funds to this important area. Further details of the necessary changes are set out in the Budget documentation and full details will be provided by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. Public service reform Public service pay and staff numbers The Task Force on the Public Service established by the Taoiseach has been preparing an action plan for the public service and its recommendations will be considered by the Government in November. In regard to public-service pay and numbers, we must do more with less. Pay rates are a function of agreed negotiations. Our public servants - teachers, doctors and nurses often of the highest calibre - enjoy very favourable pay and working conditions by international standards. As economic conditions worsen, those enjoying protected status need to contribute in a broader sense to the greater good of the wider economy. Payroll costs are a function of staff numbers. One of the most limiting factors I have found in my short time as a Minister is the lack of flexibility in re-allocating staff resources to the areas of greatest need. This has to change. We can no longer afford the increases in numbers we have seen in the past decade. Where there are clear staff surpluses in certain areas, or where policy priorities change, staff numbers must be correspondingly reduced or re-assigned. Since the establishment of the HSE, the number of whole-time equivalent staff has increased by 12 per cent. The number of administrative staff alone has increased by some 1,900. The Government has therefore decided that a targeted voluntary early retirement scheme will be introduced for the HSE. Discussions are under way on the development of such a scheme. This will initially be targeted at surplus middle management and administrative staff, but may be extended to other surplus staff. Indeed, I believe it is essential to extend such schemes, in a targeted manner, to other areas of the public service where surplus staff are identified. In this context, the Government has decided to conduct a focused review of public-sector numbers in all branches of Government to assess whether the resources are being fully deployed in an efficient and effective manner and what economies can be made. This decision will be implemented in November when the report of the Task Force on the Public Service is received. Our approach to public spending requires a systematic change in the way we do business. It is not just a one-year phenomenon. It will have to be pursued and consolidated each year. We need to look at public spending on the basis of priorities set by Government. There can be no separate agendas or public bodies seeking to protect their turf. All State organs must work collectively to secure the public good. State agency rationalisation The Government has decided to reduce the number of State bodies and agencies by 41, and to streamline certain other functions. It has also been decided to reduce the number of Army barracks to bring it more into line with operational requirements of the Defence Forces and to permit economies of scale. The details of this first round of rationalisation are set out in the summary of Budget measures. My colleagues will provide additional information and details about each of the proposals in the days ahead. These proposals are only a first step. I will, in consultation with my colleagues, be examining the scope for further rationalisation of agencies. Decentralisation The Government has reviewed the decentralisation programme in the light of the changed economic circumstances. The timeframe in which the programme can be implemented has to be revised. The Government has identified priority elements which will proceed as planned. In excess of 2,500 public-service posts have already moved to new locations outside of Dublin. The priority elements, coupled with the progress already made, will bring a total of 6,000 public-service jobs to 40 locations around the country. We are deferring decisions on the timing of the implementation of the balance of the programme pending a review in 2011 in the light of budgetary developments. Full details of the projects which will continue to be progressed at this time and those which are being deferred are outlined in the summary Budget material. Public investment General Over the last decade, our rate of investment in public capital projects has been over 5 per cent of GNP - double the rate of most other EU member states. In our new financial position, we have to be much more targeted in our investments. We need to concentrate on capital projects that add significantly to our productive capacity and promote employment. We have to secure maximum value for money and to consider less costly spending alternatives where possible. Our plans remain ambitious, but we will have to be more patient in achieving them. Gross capital spending next year will amount to over 5 per cent of projected GNP in 2009, or EUR 8.2 billion in absolute terms. We will seek to maintain this rate of investment in 2010 and 2011. If the quantity of investment is less than planned, we are determined that its quality will more than compensate in value to the wider economy. The Government capital investment programme in 2009 will support core capital investment priorities such as:  the improvements in public transport, including work on extending Luas services to the Point and to Cherrywood, completion of the Cork to Midleton commuter line and general capacity improvements;  the continuing work on the major inter-urban roads, which are all on schedule for completion in 2010;  the ongoing work on the Convention Centre in Dublin, which is scheduled for completion in 2010 and  the continuing substantial investment in water services, which will receive an additional EUR 90 million, or 19 per cent, in 2009. These projects will help provide the foundations for future economic expansion and sustainable job creation. Direct Government capital investment will be complemented by the extensive capital investment programmes of the commercial State bodies such as the highly visible progress being made by Dublin Airport Authority on Terminal Two in Dublin airport and the investment by the State energy companies in energy infrastructure. Support for enterprise and jobs I am also maintaining our very significant investment in promoting the knowledge economy and enterprise development with a total of almost EUR 500 million in exchequer capital expenditure in 2009. Of this total, I have provided over EUR 300 million for the continued implementation of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to drive world class research and in-company research and development with a view to commercialising new ideas and knowhow for the longer term benefit of the economy. We have allocated EUR 179 million to Science Foundation Ireland in 2009, up from EUR 172 million this year, while Enterprise Science Technology Innovation will receive a 2.5 per cent year-on-year increase, bringing it to EUR 127 million in 2009. Ireland must continue to compete aggressively for overseas investment while supporting the indigenous sector. Enterprise Ireland and the IDA will be well placed in the coming year to ensure that export-led growth continues to underpin economic renewal. The Government will continue to promote research and development, innovation and commercialisation by private enterprise. School building This year we are investing EUR 810 million in capital projects for education. Next year I am providing EUR 889 million - an increase of EUR 79 million. Continued strong investment in our primary and post-primary school infrastructure remains a key priority for the Government. This year, we have delivered 12,000 new primary school places, a record number in any one year. Next year, EUR 581 million, or two-thirds of the total education capital budget, will be devoted to the school-building programme. This substantial investment will provide additional school places, in response to the increased population. It will allow for the modernisation of the existing school infrastructure. Higher education plays a critical role in fostering economic development and promoting social cohesion. Capital investment in the sector is being increased to EUR 265 million in 2009, an increase of over EUR 80 million on last year. The Minister for Education and Science will be providing further details in due course. Housing The Government has invested significantly in housing in recent years. For 2009, the Government is allocating over EUR 1.65 billion in exchequer funding for a range of housing programmes. In view of the changed conditions in the housing market, we have decided to reform some schemes. First, we will extend the existing local authority mortgage scheme by increasing the maximum loan available to borrowers. This extension will assist purchasers who wish to become homeowners but who are at this time unable to obtain loan finance. This will be a targeted and temporary initiative. Funding will be provided by the Housing Finance Agency and it will be operated by a small number of local authorities acting on a regional basis. Second, we have decided to introduce a single Government equity initiative to replace a range of existing schemes which have developed in recent years. Under this initiative, the Government will assist those seeking affordable housing by taking an equity share. This proposal will simplify the delivery of affordable homes. The full details of these changes will be announced by my ministerial colleagues with responsibility for housing. Climate change policy Climate change is a critical issue for this Government. Based on the latest available data our greenhouse gas emissions were an estimated 70 million tonnes. We are committed to reducing our emissions to an annual average of 63 million tonnes over the period 2008-2012. The EPA has projected that, based on measures already taken and those already planned, the annual average emissions will now be higher than previously estimated. In the Budget last year, we introduced significant changes to begin the process of moving to a lower carbon-intensive economy. This year, we intend to build on these steps. We must learn to use energy more efficiently. The Government can play a role in improving energy efficiency in our homes. To that end, we are providing additional funding for a number of measures. We are allocating EUR 20 million for the Home Energy Saving Scheme in 2009, an increase of EUR 15 million on 2008. This will provide grants of up to 30 per cent of the cost of retro-fitting homes. This scheme will increase energy efficiency and lead to CO2 savings. This scheme complements the Warmer Homes Scheme which provides insulation and energy advice to households in receipt of various social welfare benefits. The exchequer will provide EUR 5 million for this scheme in 2009 and this will be supplemented by funds from industry. We are also introducing a new scheme to examine the potential for energy savings in local authority housing stock through the retro-fitting of older heating systems with new green energies. There are a number of taxation measures in this area which I will deal with shortly. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will deal with climate change policy in more detail in his Carbon Budget which he will present to the House tomorrow. Taxation in general We have been successful in building and maintaining strong economic growth for more than a decade. While a range of factors have contributed to this success, the ability of the tax system to adapt and respond to the changing needs and pressures of a globalised economy has played a significant part. As we go forward, our tax system will need to evolve and change in order to align with ever more changing political, economic, environmental and fiscal conditions. For example, globalisation and ageing are challenges that require us to think about the way we raise tax in the future. Ageing increases pensions and health-related expenditures, while globalisation means tax bases are more mobile - an unhealthy combination of increasing costs and revenue risk. The Commission on Taxation will inform our strategic thinking about the nature, incidence and burden of taxation for the next 10 to 20 years. We have a low tax burden by European standards. As a country, we have made a choice to reward work and enterprise. But it must be recognised that we demand ever more ambitious public services. We have an ageing population and at the same time more modest rates of economic growth in the future are anticipated. This means that less money will be available to meet public expenditure demands. This has implications for our tax system in the long run. In the next year, close to EUR 2 billion in tax revenue must be raised to keep within the fiscal targets set out earlier. If the current economic circumstances deteriorate, it may be necessary to make some equally difficult tax choices next year. Principles of taxation EUR 2 billion is a very substantial amount of money to seek in any one year, but circumstances are such that there is no option. In raising this sum, the Government has been guided by three essential principles:  first, the imposition must be fair and equitable and at a higher rate for those on higher incomes;  second, the levies involved must be straightforward and readily collectible and  third, we must seek to protect sustainable production, employment and the economy in order to keep Ireland competitive in the global marketplace. The Government is concerned that some of the more expensive tax reliefs, especially for the better off, should be scaled back and the resources used as appropriate to protect those taxpayers who are most vulnerable in these times. It is fair and reasonable that those who profited most from the recent good economic times should shoulder a commensurate burden as conditions worsen. Main tax measures Earlier, I indicated that the Government has decided to introduce an income levy at the rate of 1 per cent on all incomes up to just over EUR 100,000 per annum and at the rate of 2 per cent on the balance of all income above that level. Apart from this, the main tax measures are as follows. VAT/Excise I am increasing the standard rate of VAT by &frac12; per cent to 21&frac12; per cent from December 1st. There will be no change in the zero rate which applies to food, children's clothes and footwear, oral medicines and several other products. The 13&frac12; per cent rate which applies to new houses, labour-intensive services, gas, electricity and home heating fuel, will also remain unchanged. Excises on cigarettes will go up by EUR 0.50 per packet of 20. I am incre",1,fiscal,,,,,
6,Irish Independent,20/07/2018,'Beast from the East' blamed as economy shrank in first quarter,"THE Irish economy shrank in the first quarter of the year in stark contrast to the popular image of booming growth. Amid a backdrop of Brexit and global uncertainty, Irish GDP decreased 0.6pc in the period, the Central Statistics Office said. And personal consumption of goods and services, described by the CSO as ""an important measure of domestic economic activity"", was also down in the period with a reduction of 0.3pc. However, many economists blamed the heavy snow for dampening activity, and said that the bigger picture was of a fast-growing economy. Also, GDP is not seen as a particularly reliable indicator of Irish growth - because it includes activity by multinationals which does not always reflect what is happening on the ground. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said he was not ""at this point"" concerned about the numbers but he was ""not taking anything for granted"". ""If I look at the trends that we've had in tax collection for this year, it all points to the growth targets that we had for this year being fully delivered,"" he said. The minister added that income tax receipts in particular were pointing towards growth expectations being met. But despite the positive reception of the figures, analysts have also warned about the potential for external events - like Brexit or the trade disputes between the US and other entities - to have a negative impact on the Irish economy. In a new report on the eurozone issued yesterday, international rescue fund the IMF said Ireland would be the country hit hardest by Brexit, whether there is a standard free trade agreement between the EU and the UK, or a hard Brexit. It flagged a recent study which said Ireland was the only country in the EU facing Brexit exposure levels similar to UK regions. Mr Donohoe said yesterday that the reason the Government was planning to increase capital expenditure was to guard against the impact of Brexit. ""While we do face great uncertainty and difficulty dealing with all of this, it would clearly be vastly higher if the jobs market had not improved to the extent that it had,"" he added. Mr Donohoe reiterated that a ""very, very hard"" Brexit could see the loss of 40,000 jobs. Reacting to the decline in GDP, economics professor Seamus Coffey said it was difficult to draw anything from the numbers for one quarter alone. ""I think the more important numbers we got are the annual numbers that show the economy performing very strongly in 2017. ""That likely continued into 2018 even though the quarterly GDP figures do show a quarter-on-quarter drop,"" said the University College Cork professor who is also the chair of budget watchdog the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC). Professor Neil Gibson, chief economist at the Irish arm of accounting giant EY, said a strong fourth quarter of 2017 made a more difficult comparison at the start of this year. ""Given the volatility in the measure it should not trigger any concern over Irish economic performance. When set alongside the labour market data, tax receipts and survey evidence, the picture is still one of a fast-growing economy. The fall in the level of consumer spending is important to track, but this is always a feature of quarter one data,"" he said. The economy also shrunk in the first quarter last year, as well as in 2012 and 2013. Both Prof Gibson and Merrion Capital chief economist Alan McQuaid said the heavy snow probably played a part in the dip seen in the first quarter. Q&A: Should I be worried or is everything rosy? What caused this shrinkage? Storm Emma and Beast from the East are bound to have had an impact on the figures, as flagged by a number of economists yesterday. The other thing to bear in mind is that the first quarter of the year comes right after Christmas, so you would expect people to engage in a bit of belttightening. The CSO does adjust the figures to try to take out variations caused by seasonal events. But looking back over the past five years, it's notable that most of the quarter-on-quarter shrinkages that have occurred have been in the first quarter. Should I be worried? By these figures on their own, probably not. Economists spoken to by this newspaper yesterday said the picture painted as a whole was pretty rosy, with first-quarter GDP 9.1pc ahead of where it was in the first quarter last year. It's worth bearing in mind that GDP is an unreliable indicator of what the Irish economy is really doing. That's because it includes activities by multinationals which don't always reflect what is really happening on the ground. Dermot O'Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers, thinks an indicator he calls core domestic demand is a better reflection. He puts the economy's rate of growth at more like 5pc. So everything is rosy then? Not exactly. We remain very exposed to external events - and there's plenty of things out there which could cause a downward turn. Brexit is one, President Trump's trade disputes are another, as is his overhaul of the US tax regime to try to keep more American companies at home. At least one of those is bound to bite in some fashion over the months and years ahead. Gavin McLoughlin Graphic   Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe yesterday said he was not concerned about the numbers but he was not taking anything for granted.

7,Irish Independent,05/03/2020,'Boris bounce' to get higher as investment central to his first budget; OPINION,"BORIS JOHNSON led the UK's Conservative Party to its biggest victory in a national election since the days of Margaret Thatcher by persuading voters in former industrial heartlands to vote Tory for the first time. Johnson promised to ""get Brexit done"" after years of political gridlock and duly delivered on January 31, when Britain formally left the EU. But if he is to retain support in some of the poorest parts of the country, he must now address the grievances of those who feel economically marginalised. As the face of the campaign to leave the EU, Johnson skilfully harnessed anger over almost a decade of cuts to public services and erosion of living standards to build support for Brexit. Now he has promised to ""level up"" struggling regions, leaving no doubt Britain is about to open the spending taps. The only question is by how much. The answer will be contained in the boxy red briefcase finance minister Rishi Sunak will carry into Parliament on March 11, when he presents the administration's first budget. Britain is headed for the biggest fiscal stimulus since the early 2000s, when the Labour Party was in power. The expectation is that its budget deficit is set to increase significantly from the £44bn ((EURO)50bn) or so estimated for the current fiscal year. Investors appear sanguine about the prospect, with yields on government bonds close to record lows. For now, Johnson is basking in a ""Boris bounce"". His election win removed the crippling uncertainty over Brexit, buoying confidence among businesses and consumers. If Johnson gets it right, the budget could buttress the economy at a challenging time, as the spreading coronavirus roils global markets and Britain begins the enormous task of negotiating a trade deal with the EU. If talks fail, the country will once again face a disruptive rupture with its largest trading partner. Politically, the budget could also help bolster Johnson's power. It is early days, but he has a huge 80-seat majority in the Commons, and Labour is still reeling from its worst election result since 1935. The Conservatives inherited a budget deficit equal to 10pc of gross domestic product, the highest in British peacetime, when they took office in 2010 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The shortfall is now just under 2pc. But the squeeze, amounting to more than £100bn of spending cuts and tax increases over the course of a decade, has been brutal. The National Health Service and education were protected, but few other areas escaped. Johnson's budget is expected to target areas such as the north-east and midlands with billions for infrastructure, on top of money already pledged for public services such as schools, hospitals, and policing. Johnson inevitably invites comparisons with Donald Trump. Both rode waves of popular discontent and stand outside the fiscally conservative traditions of their own parties. The fiscal boost being prepared in the UK could exceed that in the US in 2018, which the International Monetary Fund estimates at around 1.3pc of GDP. But there are key differences. The Trump stimulus cut taxes more than it increased spending, and the effect was immediate but short-lived. Officials had hoped businesses would use their tax savings to increase investment, but so far this hasn't been the case. Johnson's budget, with its emphasis on capital spending, may take longer to feed through. Infrastructure projects take time to come onstream, and some proposals could fall by the wayside. However, investment ultimately delivers a greater economic impact than tax cuts, not least because wealthier individuals often save rather than spend their tax windfalls. Growth in Britain is expected to slow this year but rebound in 2021 and 2022, with robust government spending and investment. Johnson is hoping the momentum extends as far as the next general election in 2024, when voters will decide whether the new prime minister has lived up to his promises. Bloomberg Johnson's budget is expected to target areas such as the north-east and midlands with billions for infrastructure, on top of money already pledged for public services",1,political,,,,,
8,The Irish Times,02/04/2012,"'By 2016, we will prove to be the best small country in the world'","This is an edited version of the speech delivered by Taoiseach Enda Kenny at the Fine Gael Ardfheis. JUST OVER A year ago, the Irish people turned to Fine Gael and the Labour Party at a time of national crisis. We told the people then that it was time to get Ireland working again and that our plan was designed to make that happen. The Irish people gave us their support and their trust in historic numbers. I thank you for your trust. Thank you for your belief, and for your patience, and for your sacrifice. You gave us a mandate and a responsibility to clear away the air of fear and uncertainty. To get our country moving in the right direction again. Therefore, as we gather at this ardfheis, our purpose cannot be one of celebration. We will not celebrate until Ireland has reason to celebrate. Tonight, unemployment remains too high. Too many families are struggling to make ends meet. Too many worry about losing their homes. Too many of our children are still moving away. Our purpose now must be to redouble our efforts, to work even harder to deliver our plan. This Government has made a solid start, but we have a long way to go. Fine Gael and Labour are providing Ireland with a strong and stable government. Our first priority was to stabilise the economy. That meant a tough budget in which we had to make very difficult choices. The public finances are coming under control, and the budget deficit will be down to 3 per cent of GDP by 2015. We have downsized and recapitalised the banking system. Investor confidence is starting to return. Deposits are flowing back into our banks and several multi-national companies have announced investments to create further jobs, and others intend to follow. Exports are performing strongly due to our improved competitiveness. Ireland s international standing is being restored. Over the past year, the Tánaiste and I, along with the other members of the Government, have worked hard to convince international political and business leaders that Ireland now has a serious government with a serious plan. Crucial to that mission has been proving our determination to tackle the economic problems we inherited. Our commitments under the EU-IMF agreement are being delivered in full and on time. The interest rates on these loans have been reduced, saving us EUR 10 billion. The interest rates on Irish government bonds have fallen steadily. We have made a start on jobs. Our first budget saw no increase in income tax. Because taxing work damages jobs. Our first jobs initiative helped create 6,000 jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors. Already, 20,000 men and women have taken up training places on schemes including JobBridge and Springboard. We have made it much easier for foreign investors to visit and create jobs in Ireland. We have also made a start on reforming the political system itself. We cut ministerial pay and transport costs. The entitlements of former taoisigh have been withdrawn. Work is continuing on legislation to reduce the size of the Dáil, and to prepare for a referendum for the abolition of the Seanad. I believe that more women should become involved in Irish politics. To encourage more women into politics we are linking State funding of political parties to the level of female participation in elections. Parties, including our own, will be penalised if they do not fulfil these conditions. We are continuing to reform the wider public sector. We are reducing the size and cost of the public service, and radically cutting the number of State agencies. The shameful and corrupt practices revealed in the Moriarty and Mahon tribunal reports must never be allowed to happen again. That s why this Government is taking firm action to break the link between business and political funding. Our new laws on political funding will ban corporate donations over EUR 200 to a political party unless they are registered and declared. We will create a register of lobbyists and enact new laws to give protection to those who discover and report unethical behaviour. While the steps we have taken in the first year have brought stability, we recognise that some of the pledges we made have not been delivered. We had intended to legislate to end upward-only rent reviews, but this has proven to be impossible because of constitutional difficulties. We kept our promise to increase mortgage interest relief for people who bought their homes at the height of the property boom, but mortgage arrears remain a serious problem for far too many families. We have made some progress in reducing the penal burden on the Irish people of the previous government s bailout of the banks. But despite these improvements, this burden remains too heavy. Let me be clear. I will not throw away the progress we have made in the last year by reneging on our international commitments. Ireland will NOT default. But we are determined to ease this burden on our people. An essential first step and the Government s immediate priority will come at the end of May when the Irish people vote on the European Stability Treaty. Throughout my recent visits to the United States, and to China this week, the consistent message from both political and business leaders is that they see Ireland s place as a fully committed member of the euro zone as a crucial element of Ireland s attractiveness as a location for investment. I cannot overstate it. In this referendum, we have a brilliant opportunity to say to the world that Ireland believes in the future of the euro, that Ireland is central to the future of the euro zone, that Ireland is four-square with Europe, as together we build a system that will bring responsible budgeting to euro governments and euro nations across the entire euro zone. This commitment is an investment in our children s future, and in our country s future. Never again will a government be able to behave recklessly and arrogantly with the people s money. In recent months alone, numerous multi-national companies have shown their confidence in Ireland by committing to new investments here. I want to continue and grow this strong flow of inward investment in the future . . . for our future. I want Ireland to have the same access as other countries to the insurance policy of the ESM a critical reassurance for investors. We can do this, we can achieve this . . . by voting Yes. Yes to Europe. Yes to jobs. Yes to Ireland. Yes on May 31st. As you know, my message while abroad recently has been strong and clear Ireland is open for business. I recently signed economic co-operation agreements with China and the United Kingdom, both of which offer significant potential for the future. We aim to create 100,000 extra jobs by 2016. The plan contains 270 separate actions to remove the barriers to job creation. Actions to cut the cost of red-tape by a quarter. Actions to cut the different employment-rights bodies from five to two. Banks must become part of the solution to the jobs crisis by meeting their agreed lending targets. We will also support traditional sectors of the economy, such as the plan to double food exports by 2020. Action will be taken to ignite new sectors of the economy such as cloud computing, digital gaming and data content storage. People on the Live Register must be put at the top of the queue to fill new jobs as they arise. In place of Fás, there will be a one-stop-shop for jobseekers where welfare claims will be processed thoroughly and quickly. This new person-centred system will identify and help those most at risk of being unemployed long-term. With all the difficult consequences of that. This Government wants work to pay. That is why in the last budget we delivered on our commitment not to increase taxes on income and work. Reforms to the jobseekers schemes are being introduced to ensure that people in part-time employment are encouraged to take up full-time employment whenever possible. I m frustrated that we haven t been able to move as fast as we wanted to, to tackle the mortgage crisis. So, I ve appointed a temporary Cabinet Committee, which I chair, to drive action. These steps are to protect our families and to keep our children in the most powerful and precious place they will ever have in their lives: home. This is a great country with unlimited potential. We are now regarded the world over as being a country on the way back. We have the best young generation on the planet. Our challenge is to harness all these qualities together and nothing will stop us. We ve overcome hardship and adversity in the past. We ve overcome poverty and deprivation in the past. We ve beaten all these difficulties. I don t have all the answers but I do know this: a government that works hard, that brings honesty, clarity and decisiveness in its service of the people will not fail. It is my privilege to lead such a government and I am proud to do so. And I look forward to achieving my ambition that, by 2016, we will prove to be the best small country in the world to do business, the best country in which to raise a family, and the best country in which to grow old with dignity and respect. My government will work with you to fulfil these ambitions in the interest of our future, our country and our children.",0,,,,,,
9,The Irish Times,06/02/2016,"'Fiscal space', the final foggy frontier; Parties are vying to plan the spending of money the economy may not even earn","The election campaign has opened with copious argument and no little bluster over the allocation of money which may become available in coming years for tax cuts and spending increases. In many ways, it's a false debate. The money in question is described as ""fiscal space"", which is an estimate of the sum that might become available to the next government if it complies with stringent budget rules set out in Irish and EU law.  Distaste for this expression is as considerable as the confusion over its meaning. Indeed, Tánaiste Joan Burton has been moved to describe ""fiscal space"" as a ""new kind of F-word"". The irony is that the notion is supposed to be a positive one, appealing for voters, in that it reflects potential to ease the tax burden and boost spending on cash-starved services.  But clarity is absent. To one extent or another, parties are working off Department of Finance assessments as to the amount of largesse which may become available in the next five years if all goes to plan. Still, many of the most crucial considerations are lost in rhetoric.  For one thing, all ""fiscal space"" numbers are but forecasts of the amount of money that might be in play years from now and no more than that.  Argument still surrounds the validity of figures deployed by particular parties but there is nothing to stop them setting out whatever ""fiscal space"" they wish. Far more important than the amount of ""fiscal space"" per se is the credibility and quality of the policies designed to free up the money in question.  This is absolutely crucial. If budget rules are not kept, for example, ""fiscal space"" money can't be spent without breaking domestic or EU law. Financial markets would be likely to take a very dim view of any such legal breach, leading to an increase in the cost of servicing the national debt.  There is more. All ""fiscal space"" forecasts are predicated on the achievement of economic growth in Ireland and the outside world. While any party can publish a plan to set aside a specific amount of ""fiscal space"" for particular tax or spending measures, the new money would become available only if the economy actually performs at a level sufficient to free up resources.  This depends both on economic conditions and on the effectiveness (and credibility) of government policy. The money simply would not be available if growth stalled due to domestic or international developments.  Risk factor  This is a huge risk factor in all economic plans, all the more so in plans which are supposed to be delivered over the course of years amid volatility in the global economy.  For example, if things go awry in the first year of the economic plan set in train by the next government then its plans for the second, third, fourth and fifth years would be upset. It follows that all assumptions within ""fiscal space"" forecasts are subject to a multitude of forces.  This means the most crucial ""fiscal space"" projections are the most immediate ones - for Budget 2017 - as developments for that period are the least prone to future uncertainties. It is the nature of economic forecasting that reliability declines the further into the future the forecast goes - and the same goes for ""fiscal space"" estimates.  In a sense, the only ""live"" target for ""fiscal space"" right now is the target for the very next budget. Such assumptions, however, are subject to whatever happens in coming months. ",0,,,,,,usa
10,The Irish Times,26/03/2003,'Growth will remain slow'Central Bank governor says Iraq war has added to weakness in global prospects,"The governor of the Central Bank, Mr John Hurley, has warned that growth will remain slow in the euro zone even after current geopolitical tensions are dissolved. Mr Hurley said it was not yet possible to assess conclusively the implications of the US-led war on Iraq for the euro zone but acknowledged that it had contributed to a weakening in global economic growth prospects. Addressing a conference hosted by Finance Dublin, he predicted that the Irish economy would grow by less than 2 per cent this year in GNP terms, adding that there was ""downside risk"" to the forecast. 03032600126 ""With business and consumer confidence indicators quite weak, it is unlikely that there will be much of a recovery in domestic spending in the short term,"" Mr Hurley said. He added that the external environment called for ""prudent policies"" on public expenditure, which he believed must be brought back to a ""sustainable level"". ""It should be contained to the 7 per cent planned for this year. This will help to limit domestic inflationary pressures. It would also limit the damage to our competitiveness in the event of a sharp appreciation of the euro,"" Mr Hurley said. A ""concerted effort"" will be required if Irish inflation is to be brought closer to levels recorded in other euro-zone states, according to the governor. He said he welcomed the anti-inflation measures contained within the proposed national partnership agreement. ""The excess inflation over that of our euro-area partners is largely a services sector phenomenon,"" Mr Hurley said. He also referred to the bank's ""continuing concerns"" on residential and commercial property lending, noting that economic uncertainty had not dented borrowers' enthusiasm for taking on mortgage debt. The governor indicated the Central Bank would expand on the issue of mortgage lending in its Spring Bulletin, which is due for release today. Noting that the global economy was passing through a period of ""exceptional uncertainty"", Mr Hurley said the European Central Bank remained ""ready to act"" if developments in Iraq required the injection of additional liquidity. He said the economic impact of the war would depend on the extent and duration of the conflict. His comments were echoed yesterday by Austria's central bank governor, Mr Klaus Liebscher, who was addressing a banking seminar in Prague. ""In times of severe tension, it is of the utmost importance that policymakers do not lose sight of their responsibility, so as to reduce uncertainty and strengthen confidence,"" he said.",1,geopolitics,,,,,
11,The Irish Times,07/07/2018,"'If the people want him, he'll serve'; Higgins to announce his candidacy for the presidency next week","For months, President Michael D Higgins has kept his closest friends uncertain. They believed he would seek a second term in Áras an Uachtaráin. They hoped he would do so. But they did not know when he would make it known. ""I've been saying it to him for a long time, and he has just nodded sagely along without saying anything,"" said an acquaintance of regular entreaties made to the President to run again.  A firmer indication came a fortnight ago, however. ""He just said very quietly to me: second week in July."" However, the details of how exactly he will declare his hand are still uncertain.  It will be a busy week for the 77-year-old head of state. Initially it was planned to hold an event in the Áras itself, but that has given way to a likely declaration made away from the trappings of the office.  He will have to fit it around the visit of newly-weds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle next Wednesday. But, according to numerous sources, Higgins is keen to deal with the issue now.  Unsure  Even though people close to him were unsure, Higgins has, it is now understood, long planned to declare his hand in mid-July, near the end of the Dáil's political season.  The announcement itself will not be a surprise. But his explanation of why he wants a second term - after saying during the 2011 campaign that he would serve only one - will be of interest, along with what he intends to do with it. It is stressed by those close to him that next week - if he adheres to his current plan - will not be a campaign launch, but rather a ""bare bones"" notification of his intentions.  ""The main thing about next week will be the announcement,"" said one figure close to the President. Then again, as another remarked, when has Michael D Higgins ever declined to elaborate on a position or line of argument?  An explanation of the President's U-turn on his initial one-term promise is seen in simple terms.  It is argued that, in 2011, when he was suffering from a knee injury, he was conscious of charges of being too old for the job.  If he wins the next presidential election - with a contest now likely - Higgins will be 84 when he stands down in 2025. ""He now feels he is in a position to make a substantial contribution,"" said one source. ""His health is better now."" Another in regular contact with Higgins said he would ""probably just explain it by saying he wasn't sure seven years ago how he would physically be, but he has never been more active"".  ""If the people want him, he'll serve."" Yet another said there was nothing ""Machiavellian"" about the 2011 promise. Indeed, Higgins is consistently told by members of the public that he should stand again.  Plan of action ""He has strong views of what he wants to do,"" it is added. The arguments  the President will make for why he should have another term are emerging.  He will seek to capitalise on his widely praised stewardship of the 1916 centenary commemorations by arguing for continuity in the Áras during the next phase, which will mark the War of Independence and the Civil War. The centenaries of the Soloheadbeg ambush and the sitting of the first Dáil take place in January, and Higgins believes his family history will help him steer the State through what could be a contentious period of reflection. The President's father and his uncles fought in the IRA during the War of Independence. In the Civil War, his father, John, took the anti-Treaty side while his uncle Peter fought for the pro-Treaty side. John fell into poverty after being shunned by his employers after the Civil War, while Peter became an officer in the Army. Peter raised two of John's children, including the President.  This history, coupled with his handling of recent commemorations, represent perhaps the most powerful argument for a second term, say his supporters.  Another theme is expected to include the future of work, such as the creep of zero-hour contracts and precarious working arrangements, as well as a decline in union participation and the wider effect that has on societal bonds. He has spoken recently about the future of Europe and how the European Union will develop for citizens - the ""European Street"", in the Michael D vernacular - in the coming years, with migration as a backdrop. Alliance building with other non-executive heads of State, such as the Greek, Portuguese and Italian presidents, will be presented as arguments for multilateralism, as will the benefits of the United Nations sustainable development goals, agreed at a UN summit in New York in 2015 at which Higgins made a number of speeches.  Other key themes for a second term have been trailed at his recent summer garden parties in the Áras, such as that held last week to ""celebrate sustainable communities"". Shortages  There, Higgins spoke of the decline of traditional rural communities and increasing ""urban strain"". He touched on the loss of services - such as post offices and pubs - in rural Ireland and congestion and housing shortages in cities, as well as the increasing isolation of many in an era of when the ""transactions of daily life"" now take place on ""social technology"".  Taken together, Higgins is positioning his second term towards social issues and away from the emphasis on the political economy that marked the start of his first term.  While outspoken, he acted, at times, as a pressure-release valve for the political establishment during the years of austerity, when he criticised the wider economic model of the EU without directly attacking government policy. Strayed  ""There was a general feeling it was Michael D being Michael D,"" said one figure involved in the 2011-2016 Fine Gael-Labour coalition. ""There was a voice saying certain things that people may want to say, but there is a constraint being in government. It was better to have that in the system than not.""  Even when it was felt he might have strayed beyond the boundaries of his office, it was thought best not to object.  ""You'd just be playing into his hands,"" said another, who argued Higgins, as a popular president, would have become a political martyr if a government introducing spending cuts and tax increases had chosen to take him on.  But there were times when views from the Áras caused anger on Merrion Street. An example is when a ""a tacit signal came from the Park"" that gender recognition legislation would not be looked kindly upon - understood to be an implied message that it could be referred to the Council of State - if were passed through the Dáil and Seanad before the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum were held.  Doing so would have presented difficulties for the legal status of marriages where one person was transitioning from one sex to another. A successful referendum result would remove such problems. ""Some people felt he was just trying to help the government,"" said a source. ""Another school of thought was: 'That's f***ing outrageous. He is trying to influence whether we push on with legislation'.""  Former taoiseach Enda Kenny knew Higgins of old, and knew how to handle him, although some of his statements upset others in Fine Gael. Leo Varadkar is said to value the wiser counsel of an experienced operator.  But Higgins is unlikely to push the limits of the presidency any further in a second term, say his friends.  ""He is not going to create a constitutional crisis,"" said one. ""He is very conscious of that boundary."" The question of how he will campaign has not been settled. The only previous example of an incumbent contesting an election for a second term is an 83-year-old Éamon de Valera in 1966. Fine Gael's Tom O'Higgins, who came within 10,000 votes of winning, ran a vigorous national campaign, while de Valera largely relied on the stature of his office. Campaign  In a different era, Higgins will have to decide how to mix his role as head of state with the rough and tumble of a campaign.  ""He certainly won't be shying away from campaigning, but he is mindful that he is head of state,"" said one ally of the President. ""I don't think there will be posters. I don't think he'll be going around the country."" Another said his role as President will remain his ""primary duty"", adding: ""It won't be like a taoiseach, in that once the election is called, he is into the fray."" Participation in interviews and debates is likely, but anything further will depend on who Higgins's rivals are. The summer months will see aspiring candidates attempt to muscle their way on to the field by securing the required support of 20 Oireachtas members or four county councils.  Sinn Féin will continue to grapple with the prospect of standing a candidate, too.  Higgins, as the sitting President, can nominate himself. The question of whether he will do so is likely to be answered next week.  His old comrades in Labour will back him, as will Fianna Fáil, and Varadkar is also expected to throw Fine Gael's weight behind Higgins The question of whether Higgins is unbeatable - as is the received political wisdom - will have to wait until autumn.",1,political,,,,,ireland
12,The Irish Times,15/01/2011,'Ireland's meltdown is the outcome of the policies of its elected politicians',"A senior European Central Bank official speaks to ARTHUR BEESLEYin Frankfurt about the factors that brought about the collapse in the Irish economy and whether any other course of action might have resulted in a better outcome IN A LARGE corner office on the 34th floor of Frankfurt s Eurotower, his foot resting on a coffee table, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi is quietly defending the European Central Bank s role in Ireland s bailout by the EU and the IMF. He rejects outright the contention that the ECB pushed the Government into the rescue zone, defends the interest rate on the bailout loans and warns that default is not an option for Irish banks or the Irish State.  We and the governments of the other countries have helped Ireland because we think that Ireland is solvent. If the Irish people think that Ireland cannot remain solvent, they should know the major disruptive effects that this could produce on the Irish economy, as they would be the first to suffer, he says. A lean Italian in his mid-50s, Bini Smaghi is a ranking member of the ECB executive board and was a key figure behind the scenes in the drama that saw Ireland seek an EU-IMF bailout two months ago. He is the first senior European official to publicly describe in detail, from the perspective of an EU institution, the sequence of events that led Ireland over the edge. He argues that it s not necessarily a negative thing to have taken external aid, but reveals that the bank repeatedly pressed the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, and his finance minister, Brian Lenihan, to do more to avoid that fate. Although the rescue deal will inflict years of austerity on the beleaguered Irish people, Bini Smaghi argues that the measures themselves will not destroy the economy. Ireland s meltdown is the outcome of policies made by politicians the people elected, he says. As the bubble inflated, the Government, taxpayers and regulators believed it was in their interest to keep the party going. While recognising that cutbacks and tax hikes are severe, he says the only way out is for taxpayers to foot the bill.  WHEN THERE are people who say that the Irish taxpayers are suffering from the problems created by the banking system, I would remind that for many years the Irish taxpayers benefited from that system, he says.  Democracies have to be accountable and consistent with their own choices. I don t think anybody outside Ireland should tell Ireland what to do, but you should not complain if now you have to increase taxes as a result of the choice of economic model the Irish people made.  This was in essence an Irish decision, he insists.  I think it was a choice of the Irish. It was the choice of the successive governments, and their voters, to try to adopt a growth model very similar to the British one, with an overly competitive financial system, underestimating the risks associated with this kind of model. Many others were not aware of the risks.  For many months last year, there was nothing but praise from Frankfurt for the austerity policies championed by Cowen and Lenihan. But conditions worsened appreciably in the wake of the Greek bailout as the rising cost of rescuing Ireland s ailing banks came into view. By the time the Government sought aid, a succession of top ECB central bankers had declared publicly that they wanted clarity over Ireland s position. Alarming reports that the bank wanted Dublin to accept a rescue package were not denied. Frankfurt simply declined to comment. But Bini Smaghi says it s totally wrong to say the ECB forced the Government s hand. The driving force was the collapse of investor confidence and the decision was entirely the Government s own.  If anybody forced the Government it was the markets. As the markets were getting away from Ireland, the ECB could not replace one to one all the euros which were going out. We clearly mentioned it to the Irish authorities.  Feeding off each other at that time were unsustainable public finances with a debt to GDP ratio in excess of 10 per cent and a worsening situation in the banks relying on the credibility of Government guarantees. Bini Smaghi pinpoints a credit rating downgrade last August by Standard Poor s as a crucial moment, another being bank stress tests the previous month in which the nationalised Anglo Irish Bank did not feature. Whereas Cowen and his ministers had responded swiftly during 2009 as fiscal conditions worsened, Bini Smaghi says there was no comparable action to reassure markets when the heat came on last year. Ireland was listing from the summer, its position worsening all the time as investors took fright.  Markets waited and waited and since they saw no policy reactions they started to lose confidence in the course of the summer. Remember there was a downgrade in August but there was no policy reaction, no announcement that a tough budget was in preparation and no announcement of the measures. The loss of confidence also affected the banking system and this created a spiral which led to the crisis and in the end the request for financial assistance.  IS BINI Smaghi saying that a decision to pre-announce very severe measures for the 2011 Budget might have prevented the descent into bailout?  It s difficult to recreate history, but certainly in 2009 when the Government announced bold measures, this had a very strong impact on the markets. This kind of boldness was not repeated in 2010.  On the contrary, the impression was that actions were delayed while uncertainties about what increased.  He won t say if that was a matter of political mismanagement or incompetence. However, he says the ECB told Cowen and Lenihan at successive European summits and finance ministers meetings and at meetings with Irish central bank governor Patrick Honohan that they should bring forward the Budget.  We took all the opportunities to tell the Irish Government that they had to take bold actions very quickly, he says. Yet they didn t?  The response was that the budget would be presented in time, in line with the Irish parliamentary procedure, early December. But the markets did not wait so long.  Is he saying, therefore, that the failure to take action meant that there was no scope to wait until December?  Well, when you lose the confidence of the markets, you can t just wait to follow the normal procedures. In 2009, for instance, the Irish Government announced tough measures much before the Budget, and this was very convincing for the markets.  By Budget day, of course, the EU-IMF deal was done and the adjustment target had risen to EUR 6 billion from the EUR 4 billion foreseen earlier in the year. The more you wait, the more expensive it is, that s the lesson of this crisis. If governments are not ahead of the curve they will have to adopt even tougher measures, which then are difficult for the citizens to accept.  Many observers say all hope had been lost once Brian Lenihan declared on September 30th that the bank rescue would cost EUR 50 billion, a multiple of prior estimates and a figure so large it seemed fanciful in the extreme to suggest it was manageable. Nevertheless, Bini Smaghi argues that this was not strictly so.  Under the hypothesis that confidence would come back, the numbers were probably right. But in order to restore confidence the Irish authorities should have taken a series of measures not only in budgetary terms but also in terms of restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking system.  Important here was an EU-mandated bank stress test in July, whose assessment was confined to Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. Bini Smaghi says it would have been credible to leave Anglo out of the this process only if the restructuring solution for the bank had been identified at that time.  When the stress tests show capital shortcomings, the remedies have to be put rapidly in place. So unless you budget the money for the needed recapitalisations, markets tend to think that something else may happen and they run away.  What is more, Bini Smaghi says weakness in the Irish exercise damaged the standing of parallel stress tests on large banks throughout Europe, which at the time were cast as an important element of the battle to contain the wider debt crisis.  Ultimately the assumptions that were made to stress the banks, in particular in terms of house prices, were just not conservative enough, he says.  The reality turned out to be worse than the assumptions of the stress tests. And unfortunately the fact that the Irish stress test turned out not to be credible affected the credibility of all the other stress tests. This is why we need a new round of stress tests with more peer review and control on what national authorities are doing.  This he attributes to weakness on the Irish side.  Judging from our side, the Irish supervisor underestimated the risks on the Irish banks balance sheets and the stress tests turned out not to be rigorous enough.  Pressure on the banks intensified in September when they were unable to meet huge refinancing needs on private markets.  We were seeing that the banks particularly in September when they were not able to refinance themselves were increasingly resorting to the liquidity provided by the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland. The amount of the exposure with the ECB was in the order of tens of billions and going up, he says  The share was a multiple more than 10 times of the share of Ireland s GDP in the euro area ... However, the perspective that the ECB would replace entirely the market was not acceptable.  Bini Smaghi says Ireland s banks remain reliant on emergency ECB funding to a similar extent. This is hardly sustainable. The difference now, however, is that the EU authorities now know where they are going as a result of the bailout deal. The banking system in future will be smaller.  Not all banks have a business model for the future so the regulator has to be given the powers to rapidly restructure the banking system. I don t know how many banks there will be in the future in Ireland, probably fewer.  AS FOR the terms of the bailout, an expression Bini Smaghi will not himself use, he has no sympathy for the argument that the interest bill is too high.  This is IMF rules basically, he says, dismissing the suggestion that the IMF charges less to other countries. Any difference with other IMF programmes is in the order of decimals, he argues.  This first is in an internationally agreed mechanism. Second, the Irish Government is borrowing at a cost now much lower than the market price. So the funds received from the rest of Europe are much cheaper than the ones Ireland would pay if it borrowed directly from the markets.  Of course some would say the lower the interest rate the better, but there must also be an incentive to avoid asking for this facility too easily. And there must be an incentive to repay it quickly. So that s the principle for the IMF surcharge mechanism. But will the interest rate roughly 5.7 per cent on average curtail the recovery of the Irish economy?  There is no reason why this should happen, if I look at the growth potential of the Irish economy. I think what is important is that the Irish adjustment programme is implemented rigorously and swiftly and allows to regain credibility in the market.  This will enable Ireland to go back to the market quickly. But the interest rate on the support programme has been defined on the basis of standard practices, which are applied to all countries around the world which apply to the IMF. I don t know if anybody can get a better deal.  Given the scale of Ireland s economic challenge, Bini Smaghi says the question of reducing the rate is not really a major issue.  It s not one percentage point more or less which will change the nature of the problem, which is that Ireland has to go through a major fiscal adjustment, has to do it swiftly and regain credibility in the markets. And the faster it goes, the lower will be the interest rates that the market will charge when Ireland will borrow again from the markets.  STILL, is it feasible to reduce the rate? I think we cannot have tailor-made solutions for individual countries. If we apply a rule, it has to be the same for all countries. So I don t exclude that one day the rule may be changed, we have to learn from experience, but I don t think that this should be done for just one country. It should be done to improve the system for all. He dismisses the notion that austerity will ruin Ireland s economy. To some extent the growth of the Irish economy over the past decade has been built on a model by which taxes were kept very low. This has led to very strong growth, but may also be unsustainable over time.  We are now back to reality to find out that a more sustainable growth requires higher taxes. I don t think it means, as you say, that fiscal adjustment will lead to a destruction of the Irish economy, but maybe a change in model and an adjustment to a more sustainable economic model. But is the burden of adjustment on taxpayers simply too high?  It probably looks high looking backwards but it s back to reality. The pre-crisis growth model which benefited from substantial tax revenues from an overinflated banking system was not sustainable and it now requires an adjustment, he says.  SUCH AN adjustment is not smooth. The Irish taxpayer is the automatic stabiliser of the Irish economic model. It benefits in good times, and suffers in bad times. That s part of the model chosen by the Irish people.  That s why the Irish debt to GDP ratio went from 140 to 20 per cent and now it s back up to 100.  You have to think whether you want to continue to have this kind of model which relies extensively on volatile corporate taxation income. When volatility occurs, it hurts negatively the individual Irish taxpayer. This kind of a model can apply very sharp shocks to taxation for the Irish taxpayer. In a similar way, he expresses scant regard for the argument that there is an inherent injustice in the failure to force bailout cost on senior bank bondholders.  Again, the banks have been the basis of the growth and prosperity of Ireland. Unless you want to change model, and make all the banks broke, you have to ensure a smooth transition which requires a recapitalisation and support of the banking system through public funds.  If banks collapse, the impact on the economy and on the people will be even stronger. People who have deposits cannot get their money back, your own savings are affected.  This is an Argentine-type scenario. I would not advise any country to go through that. In order to avoid that, you have to keep in place what you have and ensure a smooth transition. He therefore excludes any possibility of a haircut for senior bank bondholders and says that would fatally compromise the effort to regain investor confidence.  If you want to put that into question, you put into question everything and the markets will also question the trust in the Irish state. If the Irish state says, support us, trust us, we will repay you , and after a while you say sorry, we won t repay you , then there s no way to regain the confidence not only of the markets but also of the rest of the people of Europe who have supported Ireland.  As I have said, Ireland is now borrowing from the rest of the euro area at a rate which is the one that the markets would charge.  Similarly, he rules out any question of Ireland making use of new European provisions which will compel private sovereign debt investors to take losses on debt issued after 2013 in the event of future bailouts.  The agreement of the European Council for the future European Mechanism is that private sector involvement in the form of restructuring will take place only in very extreme cases, when the country is not solvent, he says.  Look at those countries which defaulted, like Argentina, Pakistan, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, Cote d Ivoire. Look carefully what happened in all these countries.  The poorest people in these countries are those who suffered most.  Do the Irish people want to go through the same experience?  WARNINGS IGNORED HOW THE IRISH GOVERNMENT FAILED TO ACT DECISIVELY Here are some of the main observations on Ireland made by Mr Bini Smaghi: We took all the opportunities to tell the Irish Government that they had to take bold actions very quickly . . . In private conversations, Mr Trichet mentioned this several times on the margins of the European council or the euro group. We continued to finance and increase our exposure to the Irish government and banks, while at the same time we encouraged the Irish authorities to take swift corrective actions. It s difficult to recreate history, but certainly in 2009 when the Government announced bold measures, this had a very strong impact on the markets. This kind of boldness was not repeated in 2010. On the contrary, the impression was that actions were delayed while uncertainties . . . increased. It would be dramatic for Ireland if just by changing government you renege on the promises that Ireland as a sovereign has made. This kind of a model can apply very sharp shocks to taxation for the Irish taxpayer. But that s to some extent the choice that the Irish people have made Look at those countries which defaulted, like Argentina, Pakistan, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, Cote d Ivoire.

13,The Irish Times,15/09/2015,Neutral' budget seems right for 2016,"Between the mid-1970s and 2007 the budget for the coming year was presented to the Dáil in December, immediately before the new financial year started.  In 2008 a decision was taken to move it forward to October to fit in with the EU budgetary calendar. However, it proved a very bad year to make this move - September 2008 saw the closure of Lehman's, the eruption of our own banking crisis, and the bank guarantee. Unemployment rocketed, tax revenue fell, and a huge hole opened up in the public finances.  The budget introduced in October 2008 didn't tackle the scale of the problems, and two further budgets had to be introduced in early 2009. Thankfully ,the pace of deterioration in 2008 was highly unusual. Under more normal circumstances, the economy evolves sufficiently slowly so that the information available at the end of September, on which the budget is based, is a good guide to the end-year outturn.  This year the available information suggests that the budgetary outturn will be well ahead of earlier government expectations, with a deficit of 2 per cent of GDP or less. Even with the uncertainty about China, the momentum in the Irish economy means that fairly rapid growth is likely to continue into 2016. This is the basis on which to assess what the budgetary strategy should be for 2016.  As has been the practice in recent years, the Department of Finance will probably err on the side of caution in choosing the economic forecast that will underpin the budget. However, whatever about caution in the economic forecasts, there are a lot of pressures on the Government to be generous in Budget 2016, with tax cuts and expenditure increases being widely canvassed. However, as the Fiscal Council has argued, given the continuing high level of debt, prudence is still appropriate. With the economy growing, tax revenue is also rising rapidly and expenditure on welfare is falling as the numbers of unemployed decline. The accelerated growth in the economy, and the fact that the current account of the balance of payments is broadly in balance, suggests it would be inappropriate to provide a stimulus to the economy. With unemployment still high, and low inflation, a ""neutral"" budgetary stance seems the right choice for 2016. While it may be easy to recommend a neutral budget, it is a more complex task to translate this into actual budgetary measures.  Unchanged  A policy of economic neutrality means keeping the average rate of tax broadly unchanged. With some inflation, albeit very low, this would imply raising flat-rate excise taxes by the rate of inflation, and raising income tax credits and bands in line with rising wage rates. Although wage growth remains low, this inflation-proofing suggests spending a few hundred million on what are referred to in the budget as ""reductions"" in income tax or the universal social charge (USC).  Similarly on the expenditure side, neutrality would imply raising welfare rates in line with the rate of inflation and also raising public sector pay rates in line with private sector pay rates.  Once again this would translate into what the budget terms an increase in expenditure of a few hundred million. When these tax and expenditure measures are taken together, a neutral budget in economic terms would actually translate into a budget that ""gave away"" around EUR 1 billion.  As the Government appears to be currently planning measures costing between EUR 1.2- EUR 1.5 billion, this would not be very different from the neutral budget that I would consider appropriate.  On the assumption of continuing growth in the economy this would also imply that government borrowing would fall below 1 per cent of GDP next year. The growth in the economy is producing other desirable changes in the economy which will further reduce the government debt this year and next.  As a consequence of the banking collapse, the taxpayer ended up spending around EUR 65 billion on propping up the banks. However, as a result of the economic turnaround and the banks returning to financial health, the State is beginning to see some of this huge sum returning.  Already the government accounts show receipts this year of EUR 2.1 billion from Bank of Ireland and PTSB. Between now and next summer, the public finances should see a repayment by AIB of between EUR 2 billion and EUR 4 billion. That is before factoring in any proceeds from selling any more of the State's ordinary shares in the banks. Because of accounting conventions, most, if not all, of these receipts will not be considered as reducing government borrowing. However, they will all serve to reduce the national debt.  Repayments  With the prospect of a low level of borrowing next year, combined with expected repayments from the banks and a run down in the continuing very high level of cash reserves, the gross debt to GDP ratio is likely to fall from around 100 per cent of GDP at the end of this year to below 90 per cent of GDP next year (see graph, left).  Looking beyond 2016, extreme caution is necessary. A benign scenario could see the State move into surplus in 2017, a gradual move to full employment, and a further large reduction in the debt arising from the sale of the State's stake in the banks.  However, there are many dangers on the horizon which could puncture the recovery, leaving the economy still very exposed due to its indebtedness. In particular, an economic slowdown, especially if accompanied by a big rise in interest rates, would have a severe impact on the still indebted Irish economy.",1,trade,2008 crisis,,,,usa
14,Irish Independent,22/06/2016,'Nobody has any idea how long Government will last',"FINANCE Minister Michael Noonan has said ""nobody has any idea"" how long the new Government will last. As he reaffirmed plans to abolish the much-hated Universal Social Charges by 2021, Mr Noonan said he was proceeding on the basis the Government will survive at least three years. ""Nobody has any idea how long this Government will last. The agreement with Fianna Fáil is that we will review the position after passing the third budget so I'm planning on working towards three budgets. ""Everybody knows it's a minority Government. Everybody knows it's the first time since the foundation of the State that we've tried to govern with a minority Government,"" he said. ""I'm not in the prediction business. All I'll say is that as long as we're here, we're going to manage the situation prudently."" Asked whether, like Taoiseach Enda Kenny, he intends to continue in office until the next election, Mr Noonan replied: ""I've signed on for Government so we'll see what happens."" He said that unlike his early years as minister, the Department of Finance now has money to do ""better for health, better for education, better for law and order, better for childcare"". The country's budgets will be balanced from 2018 and after that (EURO)1bn will be put into a 'Rainy Day Fund' every year. ""We're redirecting policy after coming through the correction phase. After getting the economy running strongly we're going to use the fruits of growth now to repair the services that were damaged. ""That's why there's greater emphasis now on spending and investment than there was,"" Mr Noonan said at the launch of the 'Summer Economic Statement'. Asked how long he expects the Government will last, he replied: ""How long the journey will last is a matter of predication. We're not going to be put off by the uncertainty of the prospects ahead. We're not going to be a 'do nothing government'. We're going to assume that it's going to last and we'll make decisions on that basis."" Despite this, he indicated that the Fine Gael-led Government intends to make the USC disappear from payslips by 2022. Workers with a salary of around (EURO)70,000 upwards will be subjected to a ""solidarity levy"" to ensure low and middle-income earners gain most, he said. Mr Noonan said the actual detail of USC cuts would have to be discussed, but it will be the ""main tax target"" in next October's Budget. ""It's a programme that will go on for four or five years and will eventually result in the elimination of a tax that was introduced as an emergency tax,"" he said. He noted that political parties varied on what constitutes a high-earner but he hopes to find a consensus. A budget will not be able to pass through the Dáil unless Fine Gael reaches agreement with Fianna Fáil. The economic statement also recommits to introducing a PRSI scheme for the selfemployed and increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for the self-employed to match the PAYE tax credit by 2018. The existing PAYE tax credit for high earners will be removed ""to further enhance the progressivity of the income tax system"", it says. And extra revenue is to be raised ""by increasing taxation on measures that promote healthier lifestyles"". Reacting to the tax package, Fianna Fáil's finance spokesman Michael McGrath said: ""It is our view that the (EURO)330m available for tax measures in 2017 should be targeted to benefit low and middle-income earners. ""Given the impact of non-indexation of tax bands and credits as proposed in the document this effectively amounts to a neutral tax package."" However, the Labour Party's Joan Burton described the tax measures as having a ""built-in bonus for the better-off"". She urged Mr Noonan to start any solidarity levy introduced to claw back USC cuts at (EURO)70,000.",0,,,,,,

16,Irish Independent,27/05/2020,'Severe austerity won't be needed' - State is urged to spend big during recovery,"THE Government will need to spend billions of euro over several years to support the economy but there is no need for a return to austerity, according to the State's budget watchdog. In its latest budget assessment, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) says that even though the public finances will be stretched by Covid-19 spending, there is no need for a return to the ""severe austerity"" of the post-crash era. For years, it has warned about overspending by government, however it now says a ""sizeable fiscal stimulus"" will be needed to help the economy recover. It estimates that in the year to April, the economy contracted by a fifth as businesses closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus and more than half a million people lost their jobs, pushing unemployment to a record high. ""Actions so far to tackle the immediate economic crisis have been appropriate and those supports should remain in place as long as needed, although the measures may need to evolve over time,"" Sebastian Barnes, who is the council's acting head, told journalists in a video call. ""During the recovery phase, a sizeable fiscal stimulus will be needed to help support activity,"" he said. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe have repeatedly warned that some of the pandemic payments will need to be reined in and that rapid action will be needed on the deficit to avoid austerity. So far, the Government has budgeted around (EURO)7bn in extra spending on health, wage supports and support for companies, with an additional (EURO)7bn available in loans and grants. The budget deficit this year is set to hit 14pc of gross domestic product after two years in surplus. The IFAC believes that budget spending will need to remain high as the economy moves out of the immediate shock, and although it could not give a precise figure for the extra spending needed, it pencilled in (EURO)10bn as an example to show that the stimulus would need to be substantial. The budget watchdog expects the economy to start moving into a recovery phase in 2021 and 2022 when it will still need budget support from Government coffers and then into a 'new normal' phase between 2023 and 2025, when the process of consolidating the budget could start. Given the uncertainties over a potential second wave of infections as the lockdown is eased and the uncertain outlook for the economy, Mr Barnes said it was impossible to chart a precise path for Government finances. ""It is important that support continues as long as it is needed and it would be counterproductive, I think, to draw it back prematurely,"" he said. By 2021, the ratio of government debt to the economy's output could be approaching crisis-era levels at 160pc of modified gross national income, a measure used by statisticians to estimate the size of the Irish economy. The budget will still be in deficit of 3pc of gross domestic product by 2025, the IFAC projects. Despite the colossal deficit, the pace of budget consolidation will only need to run at roughly half the annual rate of the post-crash as the Irish economy will be growing once again and ultra-low interest rates mean that, despite a rise in debt, the bill for government debt will actually fall.

17,Irish Independent,15/10/2014,'Squeezed middle' was focus says Noonan 'Squeezed middle' was focus says Noonan; Howlin reveals public sector pay talks will begin next year,"FINANCE Minister Michael Noonan has rejected claims he has introduced a 'giveaway Budget' aimed at buying the next General Election. In an interview with the Irish Independent, Mr Noonan defended his Budget, saying it was ""very prudent"" and aimed at helping lower and middle income earners. ""This is a very prudent Budget. The intention of the tax relief in the Budget is first of all to free up the labour force and, over the course of the three-year programme, it will contribute to the creation of 15,000 jobs,"" he said. Mr Noonan said he wanted to focus in on the ""squeezed middle"" in order to increase consumer spending across the country. ""The marginal rate of tax is very, very high. I wanted to focus on middle-income groups, people who we have been calling the coping classes, the squeezed middle, you have heard all these phrases,"" he said. But, Mr Noonan said that he deliberately increased the Universal Social Charge (USC) for earners over (EURO)70,000 to avoid high earners benefiting from ""extravagant gains"". He said: ""If I just took a per cent off the marginal rate, once you got into very high incomes over (EURO)100,000 the gains would be very extravagant. ""So I have dealt with that by putting a cap at (EURO)70,000, so that the relief given by the reduction income tax over (EURO)70,000 is taken away by the increase in USC. But those earning more than (EURO)70,000 will still get the same relief as everyone else on the portion of their income under (EURO)70,000."" Mr Noonan said he wanted workers in towns and villages across the country to use the small amount of additional money to boost trade in the shops and businesses. ""We are conscious that a lot of towns and villages around the country have very little spending power now. So if you give a little money to taxpayers, it will help retail and help the economies all around the country,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence will go up and there will be more spending power. So they were the two main purposes of the Budget, to increase confidence, to increase consumer spending and increase jobs."" Mr Noonan also said the ongoing international controversy surrounding the ""double Irish"" tax arrangement had damaged the country's reputation. ""There is no doubt our reputation was taking a hit, but worse than that it was creating uncertainty. The objective was to get certainty back in to the Irish offering,"" he said. ""The policy I announced today has been endorsed very strongly by the American Chamber of Commerce, IBEC and the IDA. We now have certainty and Ireland is continuing to lead out front in terms of foreign direct investment,"" he said. He restated that the country's 12.5pc corporation tax rate is ""non-negotiable"" and is here to stay. Public Expenditure Minister Brendan Howlin defended the (EURO)190m package of reliefs being given to welfare recipients and old-age pensioners. He stood over his decision to restore the ""modest"" Christmas bonuses to old-age pensioners and those out of work, worth a quarter of their weekly payment. Mr Howlin also said that he intends to ""unwind"" the financial emergency legislation next year in the context of opening discussions with public sector unions as he ended the moratorium on recruitment.

18,The Irish Times,17/09/2009,'The banks should be grateful for the continued support and forbearance extended by the citizens',"DÁIL DEBATE:This is an edited version of the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 second stage speech by the Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan IN THE history of this State, few subjects have been debated more intensively and more passionately than the Government s proposal to establish a National Asset Management Agency. Since I published the draft legislation on July 30th last, there has been a fast and furious debate on the airwaves, in the print media, on websites, at public gatherings, at a lengthy committee meeting of these Houses two weeks ago and, I am sure, in every household around the country. This is as it should be. It is impossible to overstate the fundamental importance of the resolution of our banking crisis to our economic recovery. A clear understanding of why our banking system got into this crisis is also of the utmost importance. We must learn lessons from this crisis and we must and will take the necessary steps to ensure that we never make the same mistakes again. I accept the good intentions of most contributors to the debate. Some of the commentary was ill- informed; some of it, from those who know better, was mischievous, but many constructive suggestions and amendments have been put forward and the Government has taken the best of them on board. I want to stress that I am open to further constructive amendments from the members of this House which will improve the legislation and protect the citizens of the State. Much of the debate has centred on the risk involved in Nama. Let us be clear: the resolution of the banks difficulties involves risk; risk that the private sector will not take. That is why this Government, like governments all over the world, has had to step in. But there is another risk that is less prominent in the debate. That is the risk to the taxpayer of paralysis and delay. If we do not act now to free our banks of their higher risk loans, we will not be in a position to benefit from the economic recovery that appears to be emerging in the United States and in Europe. Without a healthy and functioning banking system our businesses and service providers will not be able to grow and develop their products for our main markets. If we do not stand ready to take advantage of a global upturn, as an open, free- market economy dependent on foreign direct investment and international capital flows, we will lose market share and we will lose jobs. That is the very real risk confronting our country. So, the time for debate comes to an end. The Government has a duty to act. Our proposal to establish an asset management agency has received the backing of the IMF and the ECB. It is also clear that the proposal has credibility in the financial markets. Since its announcement, the cost of borrowing by the State has fallen by 1.5 per cent for 10- year money tangible evidence that the Government s strategy is already working. A Cheann Comhairle, the citizens of this country are understandably angry about the state of the banks. They are bitterly disappointed by the failure of our regulatory system. They are appalled by the details of the reprehensible behaviour of some in the financial system and in the property sector in whom they placed their trust and they are also angry with the Government. Many ask why we are putting money into the banks while they endure the brunt of the difficult budgetary decisions which we must take. There is now unfortunately a breakdown of trust in the entire system. But the public also knows we need the banks. The public understands we cannot have economic recovery unless we fix our banking system. It is not just about bank guarantees, recapitalisation and asset management solutions for impaired assets. It is something much more fundamental and tangible. People need to be reassured that their deposits are safe. They need to believe that senior management and directors in the banks are responsible, trustworthy and accountable for their actions. This will not happen overnight. It will require much hard work by all of us. This Government is determined to refashion the financial and banking system and to address and correct all regulatory and governance shortcomings. We will give a clear direction to the banks about what is expected of them. And let me be absolutely clear as I stand here today on behalf of the people of Ireland: the banks should be extremely grateful for the continued support and forbearance extended by the citizens. In return, the Government expects the banks to play more than their part in the economic recovery of the State by providing appropriately risk- adjusted credit to businesses to protect and create jobs. Our citizens deserve nothing less. The Bill before you today has been drawn up on the basis of the expert advice and counsel available to the Government from the NTMA, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank as well as our financial and legal advisers. Everything we do here must and will be done in accordance with EU state-aid rules. This Bill is the centrepiece of the Government s plan to resolve the problems that have beset our financial and credit system. Before dealing with the details of how Nama will work, I want to set out the context in which the decision to establish the agency has been taken. Just under a year ago, the banks in this country were on the brink of financial collapse. The wellbeing of our nation and our people was under threat. The State guarantee introduced overnight on September 29th, 2008, pulled us back from the brink. As a result, our banks and financial institutions were once again able to raise from international markets the funds they needed to ensure that their customers, whether big or small, young or old, could go about their daily business in the knowledge that their deposits were secure. Stress on their capital and funding positions understandably damaged the ability of banks to provide the vital flow of new and existing lending to the economy. To address this problem, and to further stabilise the system, the Government moved to recapitalise AIB and Bank of Ireland. As details of shameful behaviour on the part of some senior executives in Anglo Irish Bank began to emerge, that bank was taken into State ownership to prevent it from destabilising the rest of the banking system and the economy. As we know, these events are now the subject of a number of investigations which I hope will conclude sooner rather than later. Suffice it to say that the damage done by certain individuals to the reputation of this country will take some time and much hard work to repair. Throughout the last year, our membership of the European Union, and the euro zone in particular, has played a vital role in our response to the current financial crisis. The European Central Bank stood behind this country during its time of greatest need and let nobody forget that when it comes to the Lisbon referendum on October 2nd. It is important to remember that the Government s support for our banks has not been unconditional. Financial benefits have accrued to the State from the fees related to the guarantee which will amount to EUR 1 billion. The State also holds warrants for a 25 per cent shareholding in AIB and Bank of Ireland which have gained significant value since the investment. Operational restrictions have been imposed on the banks. Executive pay has been limited. New rules have been imposed on the banks in their dealings with business customers and residential mortgage holders. Nor has State support saved the banks from losses in this crisis. Shareholders, many of them ordinary citizens saving for their future, have suffered from enormous falls in share values and banks have taken large losses on their loan books. Subordinated bondholders have also been hit, with a large amount of subordinated debt being bought back by the banks in recent months at a significant discount. The outcome of these transactions was a loss representing approximately EUR 4 billion to these bondholders and a material contribution to the capital required for the institutions that otherwise would probably have had to come from the State. I want to reiterate that in all our actions over the past year, our sole concern has been the best interests of the wider economy. The simple fact is that credit remains the lifeblood of any economy. It allows business to source funding for productive developments and to foster creativity and innovation so that we can become a more competitive, export-orientated economy. It allows individuals to access mortgage funding and finance the purchase of consumer goods. The only way to restore the flow of credit is through a cleaned up banking system. That, a Cheann Comhairle, is precisely why the Government has decided to set up the National Asset Management Agency. Nama will facilitate the speedy removal of higher risk, property- related assets which are clogging up the banks balance sheets and greatly hampering their ability to lend to credit-worthy individuals and households and thereby support economic activity. This general approach to dealing with distressed assets has been supported and recommended by banking experts across the globe. The model has been successfully implemented in a number of countries in the past where similar issues with problem loans have arisen. Countries such as Germany and the UK are also introducing asset- relief schemes. Indeed, the European Commission has issued state-aid guidance in this area specifically to assist member states that have chosen to take steps to establish asset-relief schemes. International agencies such as the IMF and the ECB have commented favourably on the approach. In other words, this is a proven policy response that has been successful elsewhere and will be successful in Ireland. As we rebuild our banking infrastructure, we must reform our oversight mechanisms so that our regulatory and supervisory system ensures we have a banking system that is fit for purpose; a system that supports economic recovery; and a system that will prevent the economy from being undermined by rogue and undisciplined actions within the sector. Turning to how Nama will operate, individual institutions must apply and be accepted as participating institutions. The Nama Bill includes fair and objective criteria for the selection of the institutions that would participate in Nama consistent with the EU state-aid guidelines. As I made clear at the discussion with the Joint Oireachtas Finance Committee on the draft Nama Bill on August 31st, under the legislation any credit institution in Ireland can apply for participation in Nama and each application will be assessed strictly in an objective and non-discriminatory manner in accordance with the statutory criteria included in the Bill and EU state-aid requirements. With this in mind, I will be proposing a committee-stage amendment to section 60 of the Bill to increase from 30 to 60 days the period of time that credit institutions have to apply for designation as participating institutions in Nama to facilitate the application process for credit institutions. The figures I am presenting today relate to five institutions:  Allied Irish Bank; Anglo Irish Bank; Bank of Ireland; The Educational Building Society; Irish Nationwide Building Society.  These are the institutions in which we have had the opportunity over the last year to carry out the necessary due diligence, analysis and stress testing. The agency will buy the land and development property loans and certain associated loans from the banks at prices well under the current book value. It will then manage these loans out over time to achieve the best possible financial return for the taxpayer. Nama will start with the largest systemic exposures across the institutions and it is expected that by the middle of next year most of the loans will be transferred. Nama will leave behind smaller, cleaner and better-funded banks that can focus their resources on their core function of lending to the productive economy. It is likely that some institutions will require additional capital in order to absorb the losses arising from the transfer of their impaired assets to Nama and in order to maintain appropriate levels of capital. It is the Government preference that private market solutions are found and implemented. The banks and building societies will be expected to increase the equity component of their capital base as the Nama asset transfers are implemented. To the extent that sufficient capital cannot be raised independently or generated internally, the Government remains committed to providing such banks and building societies with an appropriate level of capital to continue to meet their requirements. This will be done in a manner consistent with EU state-aid rules and the credit needs of the Irish economy. I should also state that any recapitalisation of a credit institution in such circumstances must be followed by restructuring in a manner which complies with EU state-aid requirements. It is expected that Nama will purchase loans with a book value of approximately EUR 77 billion. The approximate breakdown is as follows: Allied Irish Bank, EUR 24 billion; Anglo Irish Bank, EUR 28 billion; Bank of Ireland, EUR 16 billion; EBS EUR 1 billion; INBS EUR 8 billion. Further details of the loan books of the institutions are contained in the supplementary documentation. It is projected that 36 per cent of the assets will be land, 28 per cent development property and 36 per cent in associated commercial loans. The estimate is that 40 per cent of these loans are cash-flow producing. The cash flow produced will be sufficient to cover interest payments on the Nama bonds and operating costs. The geographical breakdown of the assets is about two-thirds in Ireland, one fifth in Great Britain, 6 per cent in Northern Ireland and most of the remainder in the USA and Europe. The price to be paid for these assets will be a lot less than their EUR 77 billion book value. The valuation formula has regard to EU guidance taking into account both current market conditions and long-term economic returns. This strikes a balance between reflecting the long-term potential of these assets while minimising any potential risk that Nama will make a loss. The legislation sets out a comprehensive methodology on how assets will be valued and I am publishing today draft valuation regulations which provide further detail on the valuation process. This valuation framework must accord with EU state-aid guidance and is subject to EU approval. Application of the valuation methodology is a complicated and extensive process and it must be remembered that each loan must be valued individually in accordance with the methodology. In that context, any estimate of the price to be paid for the assets is provisional in nature. From our estimates, it is expected that Nama would pay approximately EUR 54 billion in relation to the EUR 77 billion of loans. This is an estimated aggregate discount of 30 per cent. Loan quality, geographic distribution and type of loan will all vary from institution to institution. These figures cannot be applied to extrapolate to individual portfolios or loans. It is essential to the Nama process that final decisions on these kinds of numbers will be made only after an exhaustive bottom-up valuation process. The valuation process will be designed to meet the standard that will be expected by the EU Commission. The estimated market value is EUR 47 billion. Deputies should consult the accompanying documentation to see how this figure was calculated. This is an estimate based on certain assumptions and information about the property market including a fall in average property values in the State of about 50 per cent since the peak in 2007. This average masks a very large degree of variation in property value movements depending on factors such as location, the nature of the property and so forth. The fall in property values has pushed up property yields. Yields are now above their long-term average and this suggests that values are bottoming out. In fact, the gap between yields and interest rates is much higher than at any time since the mid- 1990s. Further details are available in the supplementary documentation. Using the adjustment factors set out in the legislation, the current estimate of the allowance for long-term economic value is EUR 7 billion. I know there are reasons to argue over whether there should be any allowance made for long-term economic value. But we are here to help the economy and people by putting our financial system back on track. We cannot do that by forcing banks to sell assets at below what would be rational prices for them. We will not pay too much for these assets, but paying too little has its own consequences for our economy and this is not the time to expand our risks. But this limited allowance for long-term economic value will be de-risked. The Bill provides for part of the consideration for the assets transferred to be in the form of subordinated bonds, which put the banks at risk if Nama were to lose money, which is not our expectation without giving them an upside in relation to its gains. In addition, we intend to introduce a levy if, on the winding up of Nama, there were to be a deficit. Finally, I should note that the State owns 100 per cent of Anglo Irish and currently has substantial economic interest in the two largest banks. Those who argue that I am transferring value to shareholders must agree that this is very much reduced by the fact that the State is in itself a shareholder for a substantial part of the system. The proportion of the total consideration which will be in the form of subordinated debt and therefore at risk to the bank and linked to the performance of Nama will be around 5 per cent. Let me repeat this point. The protections for the taxpayer of the risk-sharing mechanisms, and if necessary a levy, will ensure that any unjust enrichment of private shareholders by paying an allowance over current market value can be recouped. But if Nama makes money this will accrue to the taxpayer. Taking the subordinated debt into account, it is estimated that Nama will have to achieve less than a 10 per cent uplift over the current market values on its assets over 10 years to break even. Let s put that figure in perspective. Assuming that Nama were to dispose of the majority of its assets in the second half of the decade, this uplift in property values would be achieved even if values kept pace with general consumer price inflation. In that case, real (that is, inflation-adjusted) property prices in 10 years time would still be 45 per cent below their values of late 2006. To be clear there is no assumption in our work that peak property prices must and will be repeated. The governor of the Central Bank, John Hurley, and the incoming governor, Prof Patrick Honohan, have stated to me, and I quote: Having regard to the uncertainty in property price movements, the proposed add-on of 15-18 per cent to the estimated current market price does not seem out of proportion with the range of potential upward price movements, especially when a risk-sharing element is included.  The amount a borrower owes will not change because of the transfer of a loan to Nama. The agency will have a statutory duty to maximise the taxpayers return and will therefore be expected to use all of its means to this end. The Bill also provides the agency with a wide range of powers it needs to pursue borrowers and enforce security; in some cases this will mean that borrowers personal assets will have to be assumed by Nama. I am also conscious of the need to avoid a repeat of the current position in the market for development land. A requirement has been included in the Bill obliging Nama to have regard for the need to avoid undue concentrations or distortions in the market for development land. I also intend to issue guidelines governing the agency s interaction with borrowers in the completion of properties acquired by Nama. The banking system has let us down. However, it can revive and serve our economy in a proper manner, but the existing structures cannot remain the same. Already a number of banks are developing restructuring plans to tight deadlines to meet EU requirements arising from recapitalisation options. Any institution participating in Nama will be required to restructure its operations and I will be insisting that this is a real process leading to a reformed and reinvigorated banking system. It is too early to outline a definitive shape for the new system and there has to be scope for subsidiaries of external banks to play their full part. This will be a focus of my work over the coming weeks. I referred earlier to the importance of the bank guarantee scheme in stabilising the banking system following its introduction last year. In June last, I introduced changes to the scheme as part of the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which allowed for the extension to the Government guarantee contained in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008 beyond the current expiry date of September 29th, 2010. As I announced in the supplementary budget on April 7th last, the guarantee will be amended to facilitate access for Irish financial institutions to longer-term debt. I propose to adjust the current guarantee but retain all of the most important features. The details of this will be published on my department s website this afternoon. The new scheme will be somewhat more targeted. It will allow for greater longer-term debt issuance under the guarantee, moving it more towards the European model. The revised guarantee scheme will represent the necessary first step in the exit strategy for the State from the blanket guarantee offered in September 2008. However, it is clear that the stability provided by the guarantee remains important and for that reason it will remain extensive and retain the blanket guarantee for deposits. A key feature of the modified guarantee scheme is that it allows the covered institutions to access un-guaranteed funding. Over the last month, certain Irish institutions have started taking the first steps towards issuing un-guaranteed term debt and we welcome this positive trend. EU state-aid approval for the scheme is at an advanced stage. A formal market notice will be issued later this month once approval of the European Commission has been secured and I anticipate that I will bring the necessary statutory instrument to commence the scheme before the House in early October. The liquidity advantages provided by Nama, together with the continuing support of the guarantee scheme, will underpin the stability of funding for the Irish financial system. The House will be aware that market participants pay keen attention to our debates on financial matters. For the avoidance of doubt in the market, all liabilities covered under the existing guarantee on liabilities, known as the CIFS scheme, will remain fully guaranteed until September 29th, 2010. The Central Bank of Ireland is taking its position at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight. Prof Patrick Honohan will succeed John Hurley as governor later this month. A new head of financial supervision will be recruited shortly. New resources and additional expert staff will widen skill sets and expand and enhance the capacity for the reformed institution. I expect the draft legislation providing for the reform of the regulatory system to be published before the end of the year. As part of the reform package for financial regulation and longer- term planning, I am examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions. I want to ensure that the State has in place a range of tools to protect deposit holders and ensure that we can deal effectively with problem institutions and at the same time maintain the confidence of the international markets. I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals in this area in the new year. Everybody in this House is aware of the effect of the crisis conditions of the last year is having on the availability of credit to businesses and households. The flow of credit is essential to the proper functioning of the economy and all of the Government s actions to stabilise the banks have been undertaken in order to ensure that the financial system continues to fulfil its essential functions in providing credit for businesses and individuals. The establishment of Nama and the removal of identified risky assets from the balance sheets of participating institutions should in itself improve credit supply. Some have argued for alternative approaches. As I discussed earlier, the risks to the taxpayer of overpaying for assets by paying an allowance for long- term economic value can be mitigated by risk-sharing mechanisms and the levy. I wonder if those who argue that Nama should ignore the fact that the market is currently distressed and pay the institutions current market value realise the cost implications of what they are proposing. Nama will force the banks to take the losses on their riskiest loans, earlier than may otherwise be the case and leave the banks cleaned up and better able to get on with their future business. This asset management approach protects taxpayers. Cleaning banks balance sheets of their riskiest class of assets allows banks management to refocus the banks operations towards lending to small and medium-sized firms and away from property speculation. The announcement of the decision to set up Nama has already triggered some improvement in confidence in our economy which has lead to a reduction in the cost of borrowing for the State. One of the key amendments in the schedules [to the Bill] is in respect of the Taxes Acts and has the effect of restricting the amount of a participating institution s taxable trading income which can be reduced by losses carried forward, including losses arising from the Nama process. I also propose to bring forward a number of committee-stage amendments. The main proposed amendment is that windfall gains on rezoned land will be subject to capital gains tax at the rate of 80 per cent. Since this crisis began a year ago, the sole objective of the Government s actions has been the common good. The common good of this country requires, first and foremost, a return to economic growth. Economic recovery is dependent on three key factors. The first is getting the public finances back in order: that work is well under way and will be debated in this House when I bring forward the budget in December. The second is restoring our competitiveness by reducing our cost base. The final key ingredient is a healthy banking system that will serve the needs of the wider economy. Let nobody underestimate the scale of the task before us. Our banking system during the boom years was driven at reckless speeds and, when it hit the wall last September, the damage was huge. Our banking system needed radical surgery. The Government had to act and we did. Our critics say we should have done things differently. They are entitled to their views, but nobody can deny that this Government took brave and decisive steps when they were needed. We took these actions because we care about the economy and the welfare of the citizens of this country. A Cheann Comhairle, I commend this Bill to the House.",1,fiscal,2008crisis,,,,usa
19,The Irish Times,05/03/1993,'The shortest-lived political honeymoon in decades'Satisfaction with Government and Party leaders: Party Support and Budget Reaction,"THE Fianna Fail/Labour Party Government has experienced the shortest- lived political honeymoon in decades and the performance of the Tanaiste and leader of the Labour Party, Mr Dick Spring, has so disappointed the electorate that his satisfaction rating has halved within two months, according to the latest Irish Times/MRBI opinion poll. The failure of the Coalition parties to confront the unemployment crisis in the Budget was singled out as the most important reason for the catastrophic fall in the Government's popularity, with 32 per cent of the electorate specifying unemployment, no adequate provision for jobs and the Digital closure as reasons for their dissatisfaction. High interest rates and taxes, along with the I per cent levy in the Budget, were also significant sources of grievance.while the appointment of friends and relatives to jobs by Labour Ministers was quoted by 6 per cent of the electorate as the primary sources of irritation. The messages in the opinion poll are clear: more is expected of the Government in the creation of employment if it is to recover the confidence of the electorate; and the increasing level of undecided and disillusioned voters - particularly in Dublin - is almost certain to create the foundations on which the next government will be formed. 93030500023MARRET.RAW In effect, the electorate has returned to the uncertain opinions it held early in November, within weeks of the general election, and before the late surge which allowed the Labour Party to double the level of its Dail representation. The formidable task now facing Mr Spring and his party is to convince the electorate, by way of a consistent series of actions and successes, that its initial reaction is not the correct one. Failure to do that will not alone expose the party's flank to the attentions of Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats, and Democratic Left, but it will once again open up the possibility of a majority Fianna Fail government. With such volatility in the economic and political areas,it would be foolish to reach a judgment on the long-term prospects for the Government or of the Labour Party on the basis of its first six weeks. But these are important indications of trends which, if perpetuated, could significantly shorten the lifespan of this Government - in spite of its huge Dail majority, Public dissatisfaction and economic uncertainties conspire to provide a fertile ground for the Opposition parties, but a lack of public confidence in the effectiveness of the political process poses dangers as well as opportunities. This is evident in the failure of disillusioned Labour Party voters to transfer their allegiance to alternative parties. Instead they have opted for the ""don't know category which now amounts to 19 per cent of the electorate. One of the most immediate threats to the Government lies in the failure by the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds to convince Fianna Fail Fail voters of' the benefits of the arrangement with the Labour Party. Forty-two per cent of Fianna Fail supporters dissapprove of the arrangement, with only 52 per cent in favour. Such ambivalence within the party could be used to great advantage in any challenge to Mr Reynolds's leadership or, alternatively, it would make any midterm, voluntary, transfer of power quite difficult to orchestrate. MR SPRING does not share in those difficulties, in spite of the precipitous decline in his satisfaction rating. Only 22 per cent of Labour Party supporters are dissatisfied with the arrangement with Fianna Fail and 68 per cent support it. As for his personal position, Mr Spring still commands 72 per cent support within the party and Mr Reynolds is also comfortably placed within Fianna Fail, with 61 per cent support. The poll findings are likely to generate friction between Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats. So far, there has been a degree of co-operation between the parties in the Dail but this will come under strain as they compete for the votes shed by Labour, Those votes already show a tendency to float towards the smaller party. Dr Garret 'FitzGerald first captured this volatile vote in the late 1970s; it was lost to the Progressive Democrats in the mid-1980s; won by Labour in the last election and it is now, once again, up for grabs. A proportion of (his vote has catapulted support for the Progressive Democrats from 5 to 9 per cent within two months and while the size of the transfer is small, the indicated trend is of crucial importance so soon into the lifetime of this Government. The Progressive Democrats' share of the middle-class vote has risen from 8 to 17 per cent since the election and now rivals that of Labour, at 18 per cent. In that regard the public perception of the performance of the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Mr O'Malley, is also positive and his satisfaction rating has risen from 38 to 47 per cent, moving him into the position vacated by Mr Spring. In contrast, public satisfaction with the Fine Gael leader, Mr John Bruton, remained practically unchanged, dipping front 31 to 30 per cent. His lacklustre rating is mirrored by the party's showing, where support levels have dropped from 25 to 23 per cent since the election. The opinion poll was conducted before yesterday's frontbench reshuffle and the earlier appointment of Ms Nora Owens as deputy leader of Fine Gael. But these changes may not, of themselves, provide the desperately needed impetus that the party needs to fulfill its aspirations of becoming the major party in a future coalition government. The inevitable conclusion is that the leadership of Mr Bruton will come under increasing threat in the months ahead and for so long as he commands a bare satisfaction majority of 51 per cent within Fine Gael.",1,political,,,,,ireland
20,The Irish Times,06/12/2007,'They are the right reforms . . . for the right reasons',"BUDGET SPEECH BY BRIAN COWEN: Today, I present my fourth Budget and this Government's first one against a challenging economic backdrop. Our economy has experienced extraordinary growth for more than a decade. At home and abroad our success has been lauded. That success is down to the commitment and drive of our people. Recent governments have succeeded in managing the growth of the economy so that it has been sustained for much longer than anticipated.   The global economy is beset by uncertainties, financial markets are highly volatile and the construction sector domestically is experiencing a slowdown. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the fundamentals of the economy are still good - a point often lost by some. Next year will see our economy growing at a relatively modest pace. In this changed environment of more moderate growth, this Government will manage the resources available so that growth will be sustained into the future. Today's Budget is important in that context. As Minister for Finance, I must place one economic objective ahead of any other - that we do things now that will position our country for sustainable development over the years ahead. This objective does not conflict with our commitment to make Ireland more environmentally friendly. CONTEXT AND AIMS Since becoming Minister for Finance, I have reformed the way the budgetary process is operated to enable better transparency and to improve accountability and scrutiny by the Oireachtas and its relevant Committees. For example, Annual Output Statements were provided by Ministers earlier this year to accompany their Estimates of expenditure and I published the Pre-Budget Outlook in October. That outlook showed that delivering all that we did this year would mean increasing current expenditure by EUR 2.3 billion in 2008 to almost EUR 51 billion. Today, I am announcing all new spending and taxation measures in a single unified Budget. This reform allows us to focus on the totality of what Government is spending with taxpayers' money. By making spending and revenue decisions in a more transparent manner within the overall economic and budgetary parameters, we will ensure that Ireland maintains a sound and sensible fiscal policy, fully in line with the provisions of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact. What this means is that the rate of increase on public current expenditure in 2008 has to moderate to take account of the resources available but, even so, I am still providing almost EUR 53 billion, which is a net increase of over EUR 1.7 billion. This includes almost EUR 960 million for welfare supports in 2008, which is just over half of the total additional spending announced today. I am also providing over EUR 8.6 billion in 2008 for investment on the capital side. When I compare that with the resources available to me, I am planning for a general Government deficit of 0.9 per cent in 2008, which is the appropriate response at this time. This is the context in which my Budget is set. This Budget is focused on the future challenges and addresses them now in a way which is sustainable. Investment in a sustainable future is this Government's top priority. I have consistently stressed the importance of the National Development Plan in the realisation of this goal. In the past, Governments have reacted to economic slowdown by stalling capital investment. I will not do so. On the contrary, I am providing over EUR 8.6 billion for capital investment in 2008. In the proposals I am announcing today, I will also: protect the incomes of the vulnerable; promote our environmental goals; support ordinary working people; help home-buyers; and boost our economy, while adapting to the reality of more moderate growth into the future. I will do all this while, at the same time, ensuring that the budgetary outlook remains positive and builds on the improvements in our fiscal position to date. ECONOMIC AND FISCAL BACKGROUND AND TARGETS 2007 Economy The pattern of very strong growth, mainly as a result of buoyant domestic demand, has eased as this year has progressed but growth still continues at a rate that is the envy of many other countries. For 2007 as a whole my Department expects GDP growth of around 4&frac34; per cent is now likely. We estimate that an additional 72,000 jobs will have been created this year and that unemployment will still be amongst the lowest in the EU. This Budget is being framed against the background of significant uncertainty in the international economic environment. Since the summer, global financial markets have experienced considerable volatility, and while the impact of such developments on the world economy appears to have been contained so far, we must acknowledge that downside risks remain. Another issue is the significant appreciation of the euro against the dollar. This partly reflects financial market developments as well as growing concerns regarding the outlook for the US economy. This is of particular concern to us given the importance of the US, both as an export destination and as a source of inward foreign direct investment. Ireland, of course, has deep international links and we are not immune from such developments. As I've said before, retaining flexibility and continuing to improve our productivity is the route to enhancing the competitiveness of our economy. The measures which I will outline in this Budget will help to achieve these goals. In light of all of these adverse international developments, many of my colleagues elsewhere in Europe are revising down their growth forecasts. In these circumstances, our short-term economic prospects are still impressive. 2008 Economy Nevertheless for 2008, it is fair to say that the prospects are for somewhat more modest growth than we have become accustomed to. This reflects developments in the international economy that I have just mentioned as well as domestic developments. In relation to the latter, the main factor weighing on overall growth is the prospect of somewhat lower output in the new house building sector. Against this background, my Department is forecasting that: GDP will increase by 3 per cent in real terms; 24,000 new jobs will be created with the total number at work increasing by a little over 1 per cent; inflation will ease and the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices will average 2.4 per cent. This economic outlook, while still reasonably impressive, means that it is more vital then ever that we retain our flexibility, act responsibly and continue to raise our productivity. If we do this it will protect and enhance our competitiveness and employment levels. Responsible Management Responsible management of the public finances has been one of the prime drivers of our economic success. Our national debt is now around 25 per cent of GDP, one of the smallest in the developed world. It is right and appropriate that we should run budget surpluses when the economy is performing very well. It is equally right and appropriate that we borrow when the growth outlook is less favourable. However, the move into deficit must involve productive borrowing, borrowing which will strengthen our economy for the long term. Accordingly, for next year, I have set the following fiscal targets: growth in total spending of 8.6 per cent to maintain and improve the provision of services and to invest in the future; gross current spending growth of 8.2 per cent; capital spending growth of the order of 12 per cent; a general Government deficit of 0.9 per cent of GDP which is fully consistent with our EU obligations, and a debt to GDP ratio of just under 26 per cent. These targets are realistic and achievable and are a reflection of the underlying health and strength of our economy. SPENDING POLICY Public Spending Priorities and Value for Money We must maintain the basic correspondence between spending and resources if we are to avoid piling up debt for the future and if we are to continue to afford the massive capital investment that is vital for all our futures. Obviously the pattern of income and spending can vary from year to year but the overall trend line must be correlated with the resources available. We must get back to lower single digit increases in current spending as quickly and as prudently as possible, particularly in view of my determination to maintain capital investment as set out in the National Development Plan. A measured deceleration is required, not a sudden slamming of brakes, especially when we are entering a period of below trend growth by Irish standards. My priorities are clear and straight forward: to protect the weaker in society through maintaining a high level of social spending; to deliver better and more effective public services; to seek value for money at all levels of public spending, and to continue to invest heavily in public infrastructure. Our priorities for current spending remain Health, Education and Social Welfare which account for almost 80 per cent of total current spending. At the core of all this spending must be the search for quality of service and value for money. As the Pre-Budget Estimates showed, we need nearly 5 per cent more in 2008 compared to 2007 just to stay where we are. This requires all Departments to continue to monitor closely and examine carefully how efficiently and effectively resources are being utilised in the provision of all public services and this is what I intend to do using appropriate value for money initiatives. The Government has agreed to an efficiency review of all administrative spending across the whole public service. I have set out in the Summary of Budget Measures my intentions as to how the review should proceed. INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE National Development Plan The National Development Plan is an ambitious programme of investment in the future. Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before in our history. It will transform our country socially and economically and I am determined to roll it out as planned and thereby secure our future. The National Development Plan is my top priority. Postponing or delaying it would be a major policy error. It would damage activity next year and impair our quality of life in future. The new Multi-Annual Capital Envelope for each vote group, which is published today in the Budget documentation, provides for total capital expenditure to be maintained at an average of 6 per cent of GNP during the next five years. All Departments have had their capital allocations increased from the Pre-Budget Estimates levels by over one billion euro in total. The main elements of our capital investment programme for 2008 will concentrate on transport, education, housing and environmental services with significant spending in other areas such as health, agriculture and enterprise also. I am allocating EUR 2.7 billion for investment in rail and bus services, national and secondary roads, regional airports and ports. Of this, nearly EUR 1.7 billion will be invested in our national roads network, thus continuing this Government's unprecedented levels of investment in this key piece of infrastructure. We are building high class roads, which are absolutely integral to economic activity and long-term economic and social prosperity. During the coming year, this massive investment will deliver significantly on the M50 upgrade as targeted, resulting in four-lanes between the N4 and Ballymount and a transformed and fully functional Red Cow junction. The West-Link Bridge will also have four lanes by the end of next year and we will have barrier-free tolling too. Elsewhere around the country, 29km of dual carriageway will open between Kilbeggan and Athlone, 37km of dual carriageway will open between Cashel and Mitchelstown, and 19km of dual carriageway will open to bypass Carlow town. All these are key components of the major interurban routes between Dublin and our main regional cities and the National Roads Authority is working to ensure that they are delivered on time and on budget. Through a combination of Exchequer and Local Government funding over EUR 600 million will also be provided for regional and local roads. This will continue the commitment which the Government has shown over the last decade to the renewal of this vital network. I am also investing almost EUR 1 billion in our public transport system. This significant level of investment means that right across the country we will continue to make real improvements. Key projects such as the Cork to Midleton commuter rail line and phase one of the Western Rail Corridor, which will link Ennis to Athenry, are through planning and the year ahead will see them readied for service in 2009. Construction is also due to begin on phase 1 of the Navan rail line, linking Dublin to Dunboyne. Irish Rail will also continue to introduce its fleet of 183 railcars into service across the intercity network. In Dublin too we will build on the great success of the Luas by adding much needed additional capacity on existing lines. By the summer, the capacity on the Tallaght line will be up 40 per cent and construction work will also continue on the line extensions to the Docklands and Cherrywood in south Dublin. Water Services Infrastructure Huge effort and resources have been devoted in recent years in the upgrading of our water services infrastructure. The EUR 4.7 billion for water services in the NDP, of which EUR 471 million is allocated for 2008, is an unprecedented commitment to the provision of the infrastructure needed to support development and economic growth while, at the same time, ensuring environmental sustainability. We have made huge strides over the past few years in expanding the scale and coverage of water and sanitary services infrastructure across the country. Virtually all major cities and towns now have modern wastewater infrastructure in place and we are pushing ahead with the remaining schemes at top speed. In national terms, some of the more significant achievements include: increased compliance with the requirements of the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive from 25 per cent in 2000 to some 92 per cent at present; the completion of over 350 schemes, including exceptionally large wastewater projects in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk. Other large water projects in the 2008 programme of works include those at Ballymore Eustace, Limerick City, Donegal Bay, Lower Liffey Valley, Portlaoise, Waterford and Dungarvan, Castlebar and Roscommon. Education Infrastructure Total expenditure on education in 2008 will be EUR 9.3 billion including EUR 828 million for capital investment. Over the last three years alone, over EUR 2 billion has been invested in educational infrastructure. With this funding we have delivered 28 new schools, with construction underway at a further 16 new schools. We have delivered 77 large-scale refurbishments or extensions of existing schools, with construction in progress at a further 44 schools. This is in addition to over 1,300 small scale projects delivered in 2006 and over 1,500 in 2007. Construction work this year alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils. Given that there are 4,000 schools and that 9,000 building projects have been funded in these schools since 2000, the Government is proud that the existing building stock has been substantially renewed. However, the next challenge, and I believe the first priority for educational expenditure in 2008, must be to provide additional new accommodation to cater for the 13,000 additional children who will be seeking a school place next year. This rate of increase in enrolments poses a major challenge for the education system. Accordingly, I am allocating an additional EUR 95 million in capital funding for the Primary School Building Programme in 2008. This will bring to EUR 594 million the total budget that will be available for infrastructural investment in schools next year. Other capital funding for education includes EUR 184 million for infrastructural investment at third level and EUR 50 million for various smaller programmes. The Government is firmly committed to addressing housing needs and through targeted measures, providing an appropriate accommodation solution for lower income groups and people with special housing needs. I am making available a total housing package of some EUR 1.7 billion in Exchequer resources, which together with non-Exchequer financing will bring the overall housing package to some EUR 2.5 billion. This will support the delivery of the ambitious Towards 2016 commitments entered into with the social partners, with some 9,000 new social housing units to be commenced or acquired in 2008 and the provision of 5,500 new affordable homes. Further households will be assisted through the continued roll-out of the rental accommodation scheme and support for homeless services. All in all, our aim is to address the housing needs of some 20,000 households in 2008. The funding being provided for housing will support the important quality improvements in social housing, particularly through regeneration programmes successfully underway for example in Ballymun and Fatima Mansions and now being developed in other urban centres. I am particularly impressed by the work of John Fitzgerald and the Limerick regeneration agencies and I am pleased that today's package will support their initial work in developing a new vision for the socially disadvantaged areas of Limerick. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Carbon Report There is growing and incontrovertible evidence of the challenge to us all posed by global warming. The Stern Review together with the recent reports from the UN's Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change illustrates the seriousness of the issue if things do not change. That is why we must act now. That action will require changes in the lifestyles we all lead and the choices we make on whether to consume or conserve resources. This should not be seen as a defensive strategy but as a forward looking, pro-active response to this challenge. The Programme for Government undertook that I would give a carbon report in this Budget. This is the first such report. Our current greenhouse gas emissions amount to some 70 million tonnes based on latest data. We will have to reduce that over the period 2008 to 2012 to an annual average of 63 million tonnes to meet our Kyoto commitments. An even greater effort will be needed to achieve up to a 30 per cent cut envisaged by the EU for 2020. All sections of the economy contribute to carbon emissions. Transport, for example, represents about 20 per cent of emissions. This has been growing quickly due to increasing car use. Energy accounts for 22 per cent, Industry around 17 per cent and Agriculture 28 per cent. Every element in our nation has a part to play. Some have already made significant strides and some are in a position to take more effective action than others. All must contribute as best they can to the necessary reductions. The Programme for Government also states that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will follow the carbon report in the Budget with a report providing more detail on the progress being made towards meeting our targets for emission reductions. Minister Gormley will give further information about this report tomorrow. The Programme for Government commits the Government to seek an all-party approach on climate change targets but in advance of such agreement to target a reduction of 3 per cent per year on average in our greenhouse gas emissions. The target requires everybody to play a part. The Government too has a role to play. We have put climate change at the heart of decision making by setting up the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security. In previous years I announced tax and spending changes in this area. For example, in 2006, I introduced the favourable tax treatment of bio-fuels. Last year I provided for new grants for growing and harvesting bio-fuels crops and increased funding for an expanded range of energy conservation grants. This year I am announcing a number of additional spending and tax measures to continue to support the Government's efforts to meet our greenhouse gas emissions targets. Environmental Taxation - VRT As I announced in last year's Budget Statement, a public consultation process was carried out by my Department in relation to rebalancing VRT to take greater account of CO2 emission levels. There has been broad support for a fundamental reorientation and rebalancing of VRT. I am bringing forward today a series of changes that constitute the most fundamental reform of VRT since its inception in 1993. The revised VRT system will be enacted in the Finance Bill and will be introduced with effect from 1 July 2008. The main features of the new scheme are: The VRT rate applicable to cars registered on or after July 1st 2008 will be determined by the CO2 emission rating of the car and will no longer be related to engine size; A seven band CO2 emissions system - A to G - will apply. It will be underpinned by a new CO2 Emissions Labelling System for cars, on the lines of the energy efficiency labels for white goods, to be introduced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; Seven VRT rates, ranging from 14 per cent to 36 per cent, depending on the car's CO2 emission level, will continue to be applied to the open market selling price of the car. Let me be clear - this measure is not about penalising people for their reasonable lifestyle choices - it is about providing them with opportunities and incentives. By explicitly linking VRT rates to carbon emissions on the basis of a new and highly transparent labelling system, we are providing individuals and families with the opportunity to make choices to help the environment and with financial incentives to do so. Of course, the higher emitting cars will pay more, but by making sensible and informed decisions, many families could see their VRT bills reduced. Since this measure is not aimed at raising money but rather to assist the environment, the intention is that it will be broadly revenue neutral. I will continue to give recognition to the efforts of vehicle manufacturers to promote new technologies. Existing incentives for certain hybrid electric and flexible fuel cars are being extended to July 1st, 2008. Thereafter and in addition to the benefit of the new CO2 based VRT system, I will be providing for a further top-up relief up to EUR 2,500 on the VRT payable on such cars. In an effort to foster the use of electric cars and electric mopeds I am also introducing an exemption from VRT. This exemption will apply from January 1st, 2008. Further information on the new VRT system and related changes to the car capital allowances scheme are set out in the Summary of Budget Measures and in Annex D. Motor Tax Motor tax is an essential contributor to Local Government funding. Motor tax has not been changed since 2004. Since then the CPI has risen by around 15 per cent. It is proposed to increase the existing motor tax rates by 9.5 per cent for cars below 2.5 litres and 11 per cent for larger cars from February 1st, 2008. Details are contained in the Summary of Budget Measures. To complement the changes in the VRT system, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also intends to bring forward proposals that will link motor tax to CO2 emissions for new cars from July 1st, 2008. These measures will allow consumers to act in an environmentally responsible way. Other Environmental Tax Measures The Programme for Government has as an objective the introduction of a carbon tax in the lifetime of this Government, on a revenue neutral basis. This will be part of the terms of reference of the forthcoming Commission on Taxation. I intend to establish the Commission very shortly and it will begin its work early in the new year. I also intend to reduce VAT on certain seeds and bulbs for biofuels, and to amend the Business Expansion Scheme so that recycling companies can have easier access to the Business Expansion Scheme. Details of these measures are set out in the Summary of Budget Measures. In the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill, I will be examining, along with my colleague, Eamon Ryan, TD, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the feasibility of providing businesses with targeted incentives to support the installation of certain energy efficient equipment also. Increased Spending on Energy Conservation and Research Our energy use has grown by 70 per cent in the last 15 years and we are especially reliant on imported Gas and Oil to meet our energy needs. Energy security and climate change are challenges that face all countries and which shape our energy policies. It is important, therefore, that we balance our objectives of keeping energy costs down, ensuring security of supply and keeping our greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum. The White Paper - Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, 2007 to 2020, which was published earlier this year, sets out the Government's strategy for achieving these aims. The Government, through the resources provided in the National Development Plan and through the resources of the State's commercial energy companies, as well as through policy measures, is committed to meeting the strategy set out in the White Paper. The key goals of the White Paper include energy security, energy diversity and energy reliability. To help achieve these goals, there will be expenditure of EUR 8.5 billion in the Energy Programme of the National Development Plan. The State Energy Companies will invest over EUR 7 billion of this, mainly in the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks, in new and modernised power generation and in wind energy projects. Next year these companies will be investing approximately EUR 1.7 billion in these areas. The Government has created gas and electricity markets that are fully open to competition. From November 1st this year, there is an all-island electricity market, facilitated by the North-South electricity interconnector and other existing and planned interconnectors. Exchequer investment in energy has increased significantly in recent years- in 2008 at EUR 86 million, it will be over twice the level that it was in 2005. This reflects the increased importance that the Government attaches to the energy sector. The NDP provides almost 150 million for Energy Research. In this Budget, I am allocating EUR 13.2 million for this purpose, an increase of EUR 7 million on 2007. The additional allocation for 2008 will go in particular towards measures to develop renewable energy from ocean sources. It is an area where we as a country could make a very significant contribution if the research is successful. If the research looks promising, I will consider making considerably more resources available in future years. The best way to reduce our dependence on imported oil and gas is, of course, through energy conservation. In this Budget, I am allocating an additional EUR 13 million to Energy Conservation. Of this, EUR 5 million will fund a pilot programme of home insulation. In addition, there will be funding for a variety of measures which include the building energy rating scheme and a variety of technologies whose application will ensure that we use energy more efficiently. Supporting Farming and the Rural Economy This Government is firmly committed to the rural economy. We plan to build on our investment in rural life. Farming plays a major role in conserving our environment. It is already contributing significantly through more effective nitrates control and waste management. Thankfully, the economic prospects for farming have improved with increasing producer prices and increased food exports. There are some problem areas such as sugar where special supports are needed. I will be announcing tax changes in a moment to make those supports more effective. The Farm Waste Management Scheme was put in place to help farmers adjust to the new environmental conditions and standards required by the EU Nitrates Directives and to support the competitiveness of Irish agriculture. In response to the very strong take-up of this scheme, I am now providing for a further increase of EUR 35 million in the 2008 provision, to bring total grant aid next year to almost EUR 150 million. In addition, the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme - REPS 4 - will continue to underpin the Government's commitment to protection of the rural landscape, increased biodiversity, and improved water quality. In 2008, I am allocating EUR 370 million to REPS 4 to cover grants for approximately 60,000 farmers. Farm Taxation I am making a number of changes in the farm taxation area arising from reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the recent growth in the adoption of innovative farm business structures. The payments to farmers under the EU Sugar Beet Compensation package include an element for Diversification Aid. I am providing that the income from these Diversification Aid payments will be spread over 6 years for the purpose of calculating income tax liability. This measure follows on the Finance Act 2007 provision which has already provided for similar treatment of the restructuring element of the package. It will cost approximately EUR 9 million in 2008. The Finance Bill will include a provision to avert a claw-back of income tax, when a farmer who has opted to avail of the special income tax averaging arrangements, subsequently enters a milk production partnership. I am aware that, on occasions, the break-up of a farm partnership may be necessary because of changing personal circumstances. In order to facilitate developments of this nature, I intend to introduce a new relief from Capital Gains Tax on the dissolution of farm partnerships. The relief will run for a period of 5 years and full details will be contained in the Finance Bill. This measure is estimated to cost around EUR 5 million in 2008 and a full year. The farmers' flat rate addition for VAT is being retained at 5.2 per cent for 2008. The house will recall that in last year's Finance Act, I extended Stamp Duty relief for farm consolidation. I am pleased to say that I have recently signed the order to commence this relief following the receipt of the necessary EU State Aid approval. I believe that this will provide significant assistance to the farming community in improving the viability of holdings through consolidation. Fishing Industry The fishing industry in Ireland is facing major challenges at present. Earlier this year, the Cawley report provided a blueprint for the future of the fishing industry. It confirmed the need for restructuring of the industry including a significant reduction in the number of boats in the white fishing fleet. My colleague, Ms Mary Coughlan TD, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, successfully secured EU State Aid approval for a decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels. Given the importance of the fishing industry, and the role it plays in our coastal communities, I am allocating EUR 21 million for this scheme to begin next year. I can indicate today that the tax code will be amended to assist in maximising the take-up of the decommissioning payments. Full details will be provided in the Finance Bill. PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE Social Welfare As the economy begins a period of below-trend growth, our first priority as a Government is to ensure that the poor and the vulnerable within our society are protected. This Budget provides significant resources to allow us to address the needs of those most disadvantaged. This approach has enabled us, as a society, to deliver significant improvements for people on low incomes in recent years and this continues to be the best way to deliver future social welfare enhancements in a sustainable way. The Government is committed to working closely with the Social Partners to achieve even more. We have already met the important thresholds that we set ourselves some time ago. We are determined to consolidate these substantial achievements and to continue to make progress. In line with this overall approach, the improvements in social welfare benefits and child care payments that I am providing for today will amount to an additional EUR 957 million in 2008 and EUR 980 million in a full year. This is over half of the increase in total current spending compared to the Pre-Budget Outlook. Pensions The Government is very conscious of the need to p",1,fiscal,budget,,,,ireland
21,The Irish Times,16/04/2012,'This is a time for effort and endurance. Persistence and patience. For serious application to the job',"This is an abridged version of the keynote speech given on Saturday by Labour Party leader and Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore: IRELAND IS a great country, and we are going to recover. There will again be good jobs and opportunities. This country will be the best place to raise a family, to work, to live and to age with dignity. Our Republic will be fair, and just, and renewed. We will pull out of these tough times. A little over a year ago, the people of this country asked the Labour Party and Fine Gael to form a new national government. Every day since then, we have worked the long hours to honour that trust. Two parties, two traditions. But with one single-minded goal. Recovery. An Ireland that is prosperous and fair. An Ireland which will provide work, a decent living and a secure future for our children. On the day that the Taoiseach Enda Kenny and I led our two teams into Government Buildings, we were handed the biggest heap of debt ever to land on the lap of a new Government. But worse than that, the bad debts of the banks had been saddled onto the State and the taxpayer. The country was being run at a massive loss spending EUR 10 for every EUR 7 being taken in. The difference was being borrowed, but because Fianna Fáil could no longer get anyone to lend to us, they had handed over our economic sovereignty to the IMF and the ECB. This good country, which had been built up by the hard work of the Irish people, was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and ruin. There were times in those first few weeks, when I feared that we would topple over the cliff, and that it might take generations to recover. That we might go the way of some banana republic. But we have now succeeded in pulling it back from the edge, stabilising our economy and our finances, restoring our international reputation and laying the foundations for recovery. And tonight, 13 months into the five-year life of this National Government, I am confident our strategy is working. I will not exaggerate our achievements, nor will I underestimate what is yet to be done. Neither will I ignore what has been left undone, or done badly, but in difficult times we can report progress. The economy is growing again. Small growth, but the first growth we have seen for almost four years. We are increasing our exports and trade; attracting in new investment and jobs; opening up new markets, such as China. We have renegotiated the EU-IMF deal; got the interest rate reduced and replaced the crippling Anglo Promissory note this year with a long-term bond. We had to bring in a difficult budget but, unlike previous times, there was no increase in income tax for working people, no cut in basic social welfare rates, and we were able to provide EUR 2 billion for new schools and money to start the shift to universal health care. And we restored the national minimum wage. But that is only a start. We have so much more to do. Because there are so many households in mortgage distress; workers who cannot get a job to match their qualifications or skills; families whose children are emigrating; businesses that still cannot get credit from the banks. Resolving these problems is what recovery is all about. We are working hard at it, and we are working to a plan. We have to tackle the problem of distressed mortgages. The biggest fear any of us has is not losing our job it is losing our home. That s why we have brought forward a road map in the Keane report aimed at keeping people in their own home. And it is why we are including in a new Personal Insolvency Bill, radical new measures to strengthen the hand of householders when dealing with their banks. But I have to say I am deeply frustrated by how slow progress has been in this area. We all know that it is complicated, legally and financially. But we must do more to help families who feel that, for them, time is running out. Families who are making a genuine effort, but who are still falling behind with their mortgage. We have to manage the country s own debt problem. Don t Pay may sound good as a slogan, and look sharp on a placard. But it is neither smart, nor sensible, nor a solution. Because if you refuse to repay today you can hardly expect to borrow tomorrow. And right now, this State has to borrow to keep our schools, hospitals and public services going. Anyone who pretends otherwise is not being straight with people. We won t promise the impossible. But what we can do and what we are doing is the hardnosed business of renegotiating the cards on the table, to get a better deal for the taxpayer. We have already succeeded in getting the interest rate on our debt reduced, which will save us EUR 10 billion, and we have replaced this year s payment of the Anglo Promissory note with a long-term bond. And we will continue to fight Ireland s corner. Finally, we will reclaim our economic independence and say goodbye to the troika. Our objective is to be out of the EU-IMF programme within two years, to be able to sell Irish Government bonds on the financial markets, and to stand on our own two feet again. But to do that, we have to get our budget deficit down. This is not a matter of choice. It s simple maths. We simply cannot continue to borrow EUR 44 million every day in order to run the country. We will need two more difficult budgets. One of our biggest difficulties in recent times has been the uncertainty plaguing the euro. The euro is our currency. The money that we are paid in, the money that we spend when we have it, and the money that we save, when we can. Its value and its future affects us all. That is why it matters, personally, to each of us, that we pass the referendum to ratify the Stability Treaty. This treaty is about bringing stability to the euro. We do not claim it is the sole answer to Europe s economic problems, but it is a crucial part of the solution and it is necessary to restore confidence in the euro. The recent report of the Mahon tribunal is yet another sickening chronicle of corruption, bribery and lies at the highest levels of previous Fianna Fáil governments. A sordid saga of influence bought and sold; a poisonous creep of political corruption which infected our institutions and our psyche, bred cynicism, strangled idealism and corroded our democracy. I am proud that after 20 years of tribunals, no wrongdoing has ever attached to the Labour Party. The administration of justice must always be independent of the political system. That is only right. But we are all frustrated at the slow pace at which the wheels of justice sometimes turn. If our criminal justice system secures prosecutions, and the Criminal Assets Bureau seizes the proceeds of corruption, we may have some restitution. New laws to regulate political funding and lobbying and to protect whistleblowers will make it harder for corruption to rear its evil head again. At this very moment 100 years ago, the Titanic was only a few hours from its doom. 1912 was the year of the Ulster Volunteers and Covenant, the Home Rule Bill and the year in which James Connolly and Jim Larkin founded this Party, the Irish Labour Party. The people who set up this party, and the people who joined it, came from humble origins. They were people who possessed almost nothing, except the courage of their convictions. And what they wanted, was simple. Liberty. Freedom. The freedom to work. The freedom to have a home. The freedom to learn. Freedom for women. Freedom from poverty, hunger and disease. Freedom. And that is the cause to which we are called again. An Ireland where freedom and fairness are stitched into the fabric of our economy, and our politics. An Ireland where opportunity is the birthright of every child. And to achieve that, we have to work at it every day. Inch by inch. Bit by bit. No overnight remedy. But getting people back to work, nursing the economy back to recovery and building a better, fairer Ireland. This is a time for effort and endurance. Persistence and patience. For serious application to the job. A time for courage. The courage to see it through. For us all to draw on our rich Labour history, on our collective resources, on our solidarity and comradeship, and to work with and for our people. To face into the challenge. We shall overcome! We will succeed.",1,monetary,euro,,,,outside
22,Irish Independent,23/08/2019,"'Volatile' taxes and over-spending a risk to economy, warns watchdog","THE State's reliance on ""volatile and unexpected"" windfall corporation tax revenues and ""weak"" management of spending on major projects pose a significant risk to the economy, a report has warned. However, the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) has pinpointed the threat of a no-deal Brexit as the most pressing danger facing Ireland's economy. The State's collection of more than (EURO)10bn in windfall corporation tax receipts last year is ""masking an otherwise weak Exchequer balance"", according to the report from the PBO. ""The lack of a fiscal buffer and high level of government debt risk over-exposing the public finances to external shocks,"" the report explained. In its latest quarterly economic and fiscal commentary, the PBO said that given the international risks facing the Irish economy ""the public finances should be in stronger condition"". It also offers a scathing assessment of the Government's management of large spending projects, including the spiralling costs of the new National Children's Hospital and the National Broadband Plan. The hospital costs are expected to top (EURO)2bn and the National Broadband Plan could cost the State (EURO)3bn. ""Weak budget constraints and inaccurate forecasts are also facilitating substantial cost overruns on major capital projects, and represent a key risk to the public finances, particularly in relation to the National Broadband Plan and the National Children's Hospital,"" the report states. The report, seen by the Irish Independent, cites changes to international tax rules, overheating pressures and a global downturn as also posing significant risks to the economy over the medium term. It warns the expected slowdown in global growth will pose a real threat to the public finances given that 77pc of the State's corporation tax receipts come from foreign-owned multinationals and half of all these receipts come from just the top 10 taxpayers. ""The use of volatile and unexpected corporation tax receipts to fund recurring expenditure is a concern,"" the report said. While day-to-day spending habits have remained stable in the first half of this year, the PBO said there were indications the uncertainty over Brexit was having an impact on larger purchases. It highlighted issues with car sales, which were down 1.2pc in the first four months of the year, and suggested the threat of a no-deal Brexit could be responsible for the slowdown in house prices. The report said: ""The probability of a 'no-deal' Brexit in October has increased significantly in recent weeks and is now the most pressing risk facing the Irish economy. ""The ESRI forecasts that growth would be reduced in a disorderly no-deal scenario by 0.8pc in 2020. While growth will remain positive, the losses will be heavily concentrated in certain sectors and regions."" The report pointed to persistent expenditure overruns, particularly in the health budget, as having contributed to the ""deterioration in the general government balance"". It noted that spending in education had gone nearly (EURO)40m over-budget so far this year, while health spending was (EURO)20m over budget in the six months to the end of June. The PBO said foreign firms were continuing to outperform domestic firms in productivity and wages, and highlighted issues in the Irish labour market, including participation being ""below the pre-crisis peak, and particularly low for women and the low-skilled"". The PBO was set up to provide TDs, senators and the Government with impartial advice on budgetary policy following recommendations from a number of inquiries into the collapse of the banks over a decade ago.

23,Irish Independent,10/03/2016,"'We don't have natural resources other than the quality of our people'; The man at the coalface in Ireland's drive to attract jobs tells Colm Kelpie that Brexit could be an opportunity, global investors are 'agnostic' about our election results, and that other regions don't get a raw deal in comparison to Dublin","ATOP a cabinet at the back of Martin Shanahan's spacious office, stands a framed photo of three men. Shanahan, the IDA chief executive, is on the left of the photo, and on the right is Taoiseach Enda Kenny. Taking pride of place in the centre, is a smiling Tim Cook, the head of Apple. It's an apt image. The investor is centre stage. ""Somebody else framed it,"" Shanahan says, laughing, before turning further around in his seat to look for a separate photo. ""I've met with CEOs of various companies. There was another one [photo] there which was the CEO of Huawei. It's one of the nice things about this role. I get to meet global CEOs, whether it is Tim Cook or Omar Ishrak, the head of Medtronic, or Jack Ma, the head of Alibaba."" Employing around 5,000 in Ireland, Apple's a particularly important investor, and Shanahan is keen to stress that Cook has signalled Apple is here to stay, whatever verdict comes from Europe regarding its tax arrangements with Ireland. ""The company's been clear, there has been no state aid. The Government is clear, there's been no state aid,"" he says. ""The Government has also said if there is an adverse finding it would take the issue further. We are now close to two years waiting on a decision. Other cases that had been mooted around the same time have concluded. The Commission has said we want to investigate this and that is all that has happened to date. There have been no findings good, bad or indifferent. ""Tim Cook was here late last year... [and he] said regardless of the outcome of any investigation, that Apple was committed to Ireland."" Shanahan is part politician, part diplomat, and part salesman. In the latter role, he's flogging a product small in size, but big on reputation. It has a proven track record of reliability, is low maintenance, can withstand knocks, and comes at a good price. As the head of the state agency tasked with boosting foreign direct investment, Shanahan's primary role is to ensure a continued inward flow of foreign companies and employment growth. His job is a mix of wooing and charming international business chiefs, selling brand Ireland to prospective clients, keeping sweet those that are already here, and talking up what successive governments argue is a stable and pro-business climate. ""We don't have alternatives, we don't have natural resources other than the quality of our people and the fact that the grass grows greener than anywhere else,"" he quips. But surely stability has taken a knock thanks to the election's inconclusive result? Even Bloomberg mentioned ""political turmoil in Ireland and Spain"" on Friday as among the risk issues for the Eurozone. Shanahan doesn't agree. ""There is a government until there's a new government,"" he says, referring to the caretaker administration. ""Investors looking in, they have no reason to be particularly concerned at this point. The ISEQ has been stable, bond yields have been stable and since December, there's no perceptible change. That's reflective of the fact that people believe it's business as usual. There's been an election, a new government will be formed and we'll get on about our business. While there's a lot of interest domestically in the election... internationally we haven't seen a perceptible move."" Despite the domestic obsession with the make up of the next Dáil and the rise of Sinn Féin and Independents, Shanahan says global business chiefs - bar those companies perhaps already based here - don't really care that much. What does matter to them are the policies that will be put in place when a new government is eventually formed. ""To a large extent, they tend to be agnostic on the shape and hue. What they look at is, is there a perceptible change in what has been a very stable environment for business over decades in Ireland?"" The coming days will bring the first opportunity to test this theory, as the annual St Patrick's Day exodus takes place. Shanahan flies out tomorrow for a week-long series of US-based engagements that will see him travel to Austin, Texas, and Washington DC and New York. It will be the second year that the IDA has attended South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, the world's biggest technology culture conference and festival. Shanahan and his team on the ground will be tapping into the tech-savvy audience, ripe with startups, in a bid to lure some to this side of the Atlantic. ""We'll host some receptions, we'll have a dinner for some senior executives. Austin is fertile ground for startup technology as well as some very significant large technology clients that are based there and it's an opportunity for us to speak to a lot of people at the one time,"" he says. ""Ireland will be extremely visible."" The IDA have two people staffing its office in the recently opened Irish consulate in the Texas city, complementing its team across the US where it has operations in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York, and Mountain View and Irvine in California. After Austin he'll travel to Washington DC to take part in the various political events around the St Patrick's Day celebrations, and then on to New York for an extensive schedule of print and broadcast interviews with US-based media outlets. All the while he'll be ""promoting the Irish message"", ie, talking up the economy and the strength of the recovery. That story plays well with US clients. ""The investors that I speak to, and these are large companies, feel that Ireland took decisions early and pulled itself up by the bootstraps and got on with the job. Particularly in the US there is quite a lot of admiration for that."" And he'll be carving out extensive time to meet clients. As with any good salesman, pressing the flesh is of ultimate importance, and Shanahan places great stock on meeting investors, potential and existing. Companies with operations already in Ireland account for 70pc of investments, he reminds me, so they can't be overlooked. When he's travelling, he ensures his team sets up client meetings wherever he goes. ""Meeting clients, that's at the core of what we do. I will always check in with the senior leadership teams of our key clients, and typically we're in with the CEO, CIO, or CFO and we will always do that and do that regularly,"" he says. ""That's the process of maintaining a relationship and making sure we know what their plans are, making sure that they know what's happening in Ireland and trying to identify opportunities. That's a key part of the job."" And the St Patrick's Day events, although often criticised at home in the past, couldn't be more important for keeping Ireland on the radar, particularly in the US, Shanahan says. ""There are very few times in the year that Ireland registers on the international consciousness. It keeps Ireland to the forefront."" Ireland now accounts for almost a fifth of all new US investment flows into Europe, with FDI between the two countries strengthening significantly over the past decade. A report commissioned by the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland found that FDI into Ireland from the United States had amounted to $310bn by the end of 2014. Ireland's portion can be compared favourably to that of Germany and France, the Eurozone's biggest economies. The UK, however, is the hub of choice for FDI into the EU. But will that continue if the British vote to pull out of the European Union come June 23? Shanahan sees opportunities, both from companies in the UK that could potentially look to leave, and investments that may have been looking to Britain, but in the event of a Brexit, could look elsewhere. And he says companies are already sniffing around, scouting out the alternatives, with Ireland a strong contender. ""From an FDI perspective, I would say that there is uncertainty, and that causes those that are already based in the UK and servicing a European market or an EMEA market from the UK, to consider the 'what if' scenarios and 'what if they leave' and how they're going to react to that,"" he says. IDA's conversations with companies have ""increased and heightened"" because of the uncertainty around Brexit, he says. ""Certainly, even in the week prior to last week, I met with some financial services companies, and they are absolutely considering their 'what if' scenarios and if there is a leave vote, and companies have to do something to mitigate against that, some of that investment may come to Ireland."" Does that mean the IDA is seeing increased interest from companies looking at Ireland as a potential place to invest because of Brexit? ""Certainly. We're in discussions with companies about future investments and Brexit is part of that context, so yeah, absolutely."" One would therefore assume that the IDA is ramping up its efforts to attract either UK-based companies considering their future options, or potential investors who may have been considering establishing a UK base, but may be open to alternatives. Shanahan doesn't give a definitive answer. He hints and grins a lot, while stressing he isn't trying to be coy. He reveals the agency moved its European director from Germany to London last September, but he doesn't openly state it was as a result of the impending vote. ""We are keenly aware of the opportunity,"" he says simply. ""We are keenly aware of the Brexit context and all of our efforts reflect that. So we are extremely active in the UK market."" He says the agency has had a lot of interest from and discussions with financial services, and points out that the agency has had some significant wins in that sector, but adds they were unrelated to Brexit. ""When I say we are active all the time, we are, but the context has changed. We are clearly not blind to the context. There are more reasons for both investors who are located in the UK and potential investors coming into Europe to look at Ireland than there was before,"" he says. But he adds: ""Brexit alone, while it's a significant issue, it's not going to be a panacea or a tap."" The IDA courtship process can take a long time, sometimes even years. ""What you want to do, and what we try to do, is build up relations with companies and individuals. Individuals move and assume other senior positions in other companies, so having a relationship with those individuals is extremely important. That doesn't happen overnight, that's over a long period of time."" The agency takes understandable pride in its success. Set up in 1949 as part of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the body was initially tasked with stimulating, supporting and developing export-led business and enterprise in Ireland. In 1994, following a government review, the agency was broken up and the IDA we know now was instructed to focus exclusively on the promotion and development of high quality FDI into Ireland. More than 170,000 people here are employed in multinationals, the equivalent of close to one in ten workers. So what pushes an investment over the line? An intervention by Shanahan himself, or perhaps even the Taoiseach? Sometimes both, he says. ""The access to government and access to Taoiseach and ministers is very important. It demonstrates to our prospective clients the level of interest and focus there is in Ireland on developing enterprise."" Shanahan gives the often quoted answer that it's not just for tax reasons that companies locate here, but also for the skilled workforce and availability of labour. But housing costs, skills shortages and personal rates of taxation are, businesses here argue, fast becoming a deterrent. Shanahan says skills shortages are being experienced by other countries also, and not just Ireland. And he argues efforts are being made to deal with the shortage of quality housing. He's a little more exercised about tax rates. ""It certainly is an issue. I wouldn't say that it comes up regularly, but we're aware that it is an issue for potential and current investors. It limits the ability to attract top talent. Government has started the process of addressing the higher marginal rate, and from our perspective, it remains an issue. We would like to see movement on that."" But the IDA's task isn't just to secure investment. It must also ensure that that investment is balanced regionally, which isn't an easy task. Local communities understandably want a slice of the FDI pie, and part of Shanahan's job is to ensure the obvious attractiveness of the capital doesn't overshadow other parts of the country. Under its strategic plan out to 2019, the IDA said it was targeting a minimum of a 30pc to 40pc increase in the number of investments for each region outside of Dublin. Almost 19,000 jobs were created last year by IDA client companies, with over 9,000 jobs outside the capital. ""These [targets] are not going to be easily delivered. There is no question about that,"" Shanahan says. ""Coming from Abbeydorney in Co Kerry, I appreciate as much as anyone what lack of employment or loss of employment can do to a local area, therefore I would be extremely anxious that IDA does what it can in this regard. But it is extremely challenging."" Shanahan says the international trend is that, increasingly, FDI is going to major urban hubs. ""One has to bring an element of realism to the discussion also as to what is possible,"" he says. ""In some people's minds, it is a choice between Dublin or a regional location. That is simply not the case. ""Dublin, because of its size, because it's a capital city, because of its brand recognition and that it has a technology hub, it will attract investments which will never go to the regions, any region. ""It is an attractor in its own right."" To persuade companies to leave the capital, the agency is putting in place advanced offices and facilities around the country, with nine being rolled out to 2018. Technology parks are also being upgraded. And there are sweeteners in the IDA's armoury that can help, including grants for employment. ""Companies ultimately make the decision. Sometimes they come with fixed ideas about where they want to be and would have made up their mind before IDA has an opportunity to influence them. Sometimes they come with an open mind, they will go through different locations, but they may still decide that they need to be in Dublin or close to Dublin, or Cork,"" he says. ""We have at our disposal the ability to provide grant support. There are employment grants which we can use in regional locations, we have R&D and training supports which we can provide anyway, and we have capital supports. The main differentiator is employment."" Shanahan takes comfort in the fact that site visits across the regions are up, as are employment numbers. But he accepts it's a tough ask. It's a punishing job for Shanahan, who was appointed to the (EURO)168,000-a-year job in June 2014. Prior to that, he was head of Forfás, and before that, worked in the tourism industry via Fáilte Ireland. He's on the road one in every three weeks, visiting the agency's 19 offices around the world. While he's jetting off to the US tomorrow, he came back from the States just under a fortnight ago, where he held client meetings in Boston and caught up with the IDA's North American team in Chicago. ""I was primarily meeting with existing clients and prospective clients. Some of them are at the point where they're making decisions and I would have gone to meet them with project executives on the ground to try and help that process along and get them across the line in terms of their decision making."" The US, while by the far the most important, isn't the only investor market. Later in the year he's in Asia. He was in China ""three or four times"" last year, and just before Christmas travelled to Japan, Korea and Singapore. Moscow is in the diary for a few months from now. ""I have a very understanding partner, thankfully. I travel a lot and typically have to travel on weekends. It eats into a lot of time. ""This is not 9-5. I could have a breakfast meeting, then a lunch and then a dinner with clients."" He had to hang around Logan Airport in Boston recently for five hours waiting for a connection. And yet, despite the repetitive globe hopping, he enjoys travelling. But he admits that's likely to fade with time. ""Last year I holidayed in Ireland.""

24,Irish Independent,21/02/2019,'We're heading for uncharted territory' as key Brexit talks stall; Varadkar issues warning as Juncker and May meeting fails to yield breakthrough,"NOBODY can predict ""how matters will play out"" if the UK crashes out of the European Union, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. As British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker failed to make any breakthrough in their latest meeting, Mr Varadkar said we are heading for ""uncharted territory"". The UK government now appears to have accepted that there is no technology currently available that could be used to avoid a Border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. The latest round of talks between Mrs May and Mr Juncker appeared more positive than their previous efforts - although no significant progress was made. Mrs May said afterwards that she is still seeking ""legally binding changes to the backstop to ensure it cannot be indefinite"". The EU has squarely refused London's demands to rewrite the backstop even though the prime minister claims it is the final stumbling block to her getting a deal through the House of Commons. A joint statement issued by Mrs May and Mr Juncker said they would explore ways of giving ""the appropriate legal assurance to both sides"". ""Both reconfirmed their commitment to avoiding a hard Border on the island of Ireland and to respect the integrity of the EU's internal market and of the United Kingdom."" Notably, they also talked about the role ""alternative arrangements could play in replacing the backstop in future"". Separately, European Council President Donald Tusk said the Brexit negotiations might be extended if the UK fails to work out a sensible deal. ""Together with Prime Minister May we have prepared a very good and secure deal for both sides and it turned out that the British rejected it and offered nothing in exchange,"" Mr Tusk said. ""Of course, if Britain fails to prepare some sensible option on time, then there is always a possibility to extend these negotiations in time. ""This would be better than a divorce without agreement,"" he said. In the Dáil, Mr Varadkar again insisted that the Government is not preparing to erect any infrastructure at the Border, but said Ireland would defend the EU's single market. ""If we end up in a no-deal scenario without an extension, it will create a difficult dilemma for Ireland, the United Kingdom and the EU,"" he said. ""The UK will be bound to implement World Trade Organisation rules and we will have a responsibility to protect the single market, which we want to do, given that it is our single market and given that our industrial and economic policy, employment and much more are based on our full membership of it,"" Mr Varadkar said. He added that ""above all"", the commitment of the Irish Government would be to the Good Friday Agreement. ""We would be in a situation where we would have to come to an agreement on regulatory alignment and customs, but that is what we already have. ""That is why our efforts are focused on securing the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop, which is the best and only way to give us an assurance that a hard Border will not emerge on our island, whatever else happens as a consequence of Brexit."" He said the resignations from Mrs May's party were a further sign of how unstable and ""hard to predict"" the situation is. ""All we can do is prepare for the different and most likely scenarios."" Retail Ireland yesterday predicted that a hard Brexit will have devastating consequences for the economy. Thomas Burke, director of Retail Ireland, said retailers will see an increase in operating costs as a result of checks at ports and supply chain disruption. ""In the current operating environment, these additional costs simply cannot be absorbed and will have to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. ""Our members continue to work hard to plan for all possible eventualities, but the ongoing uncertainty is damaging our industry and impacting our customers,"" he said. What's in the Brexit legislation - and why THE Government will publish 17 pieces of legislation tomorrow that are seen as necessary to mitigate against the worst effects of a disorderly Brexit. Nine Government departments have been working on the legislation which will be rolled into one 'omnibus bill' so that it can be rushed through the Dáil and Seanad. It is expected that the Bill will pass all stages in the Oireachtas by March 15, leaving plenty of time for President Michael D Higgins to sign it into law for March 29. Here is why the legislation matters: TRANSPORT Legislation is needed to provide a statutory basis for cross-Border rail (Dublin-Belfast Enterprise) and bus services. HEALTH The National Treatment Purchase Fund features as part of the omnibus. Under the legislation, the Health Minister and HSE will be permitted to cover the cost of healthcare provided in the UK. EDUCATION Legislation will allow for the continued payments of SUSI grants to students who are studying in the UK as well as the payment of grants to UK students in higher education institutes here. JUSTICE With the UK outside of EU law, it will be necessary to introduce measures to ensure that extradition arrangements are maintained between Ireland and the UK, and to facilitate ongoing immigration co-operation. SOCIAL PROTECTION Legislation in this area will provide for the continued payment of 21 social protection benefits, including payments such as pensions, illness benefits and child benefit. Workers whose UK-based employer becomes insolvent will also be protected under this legislation. CONSUMER PROTECTION Laws in this area are to be strengthened to ensure there is an adequate degree of protection for consumers who have already bought financial service products before the date of Brexit. ENERGY Measures are being taken to give the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities powers to deal with any unusual market activity on the all-island electricity network.

25,Irish Independent,09/10/2019,"'We've got your back,' Leo told farmers - but Budget shows that's a load of bull","EARLIER this year, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told farmers the Government had the back of the farming sector. ""Our farmers, fishermen and agri-food industry are at the forefront of my mind and the minds of all in this Government, because they and the rural economies associated with them are most likely to be adversely affected by Brexit,"" he told the Dáil in January. Roll on to yesterday's Budget and many in the sector will be questioning this declaration of support. There's no doubt that farmers will be disappointed by Budget 2020, and primarily for what it didn't deliver. This Budget comes at a time that is probably the most difficult period farming has been through and is facing. And the biggest point about the Budget for farmers is the 'wait and see' approach the Government is taking towards the sector and Brexit. As the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA) said, in a normal year, that Budget would be underwhelming, but where we are now - 22 days from the Brexit cliff - its lack of urgency and detail will be profoundly shocking. Brexit may still be in the future but for the agri-food sector it has been a reality for many months. The impact of uncertainty surrounding Brexit has had a direct hit on demand from UK buyers across the board - from food to machinery. And that uncertainty in the UK has had an impact on the primary producer more than anyone else. Farmers remain price-takers and any negative rumblings in the market are passed down the line to them. Remember, beef farmers spent weeks protesting this year as beef prices tumbled, and yet they were presented with a 'wait and see' Budget for farming. That approach won't help farmers who have felt the cold winds of Brexit for months. It's the here and now farmers are dealing with in their day-to-day lives, and this Budget has not delivered a here-and-now response. The Budget may present some strong promises in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but as Brexit continues to drag its heels, farmers could be waiting months, or years perhaps, for any clarity. Many won't survive months, never mind years, as beef prices remain stuck below the actual cost of production, and it will take more than promises to support this sector or provide alternative options. Dairy farming, too - traditionally the most viable sector - has seen prices fall this year, as Brexit threatens to shut down our main export market for cheddar cheese and, in the past few days, a Trump tax on butter that could severely affect Kerrygold sales in the US. Huge opportunities could exist for the sector if it is helped to diversify into a supplier of green energy, but that vision is lacking from our leaders. Farming is still the backbone of rural communities in Ireland, and investment in its future is necessary for those communities to survive. The Government was worried about how rural Ireland and the farming community, a traditionally staunch Fine Gael voting bloc, would react to this Budget. They'll find out when they go to the polls next, but should not be expecting many farmers to have their back after Budget 2020. Maybe they don't care any more about the farmer vote? The lack of urgency and detail will be profoundly shocking Graphic   Farmers' friend: Leo Varadkar claimed to support farmers but the Budget needed a here-andnow response to the Brexit threat.

26,The Irish Times,21/11/2020,"'You don't want to be running your economy and society for bond investors'; Ireland should prepare for a recession or crisis every decade, says NTMA chief executive Conor O'Kelly"," (NTMA), is under no illusions about his place in the EUR 85 trillion-plus global bond market.  ""It's normally a planes, trains and automobiles job for us in the NTMA. A small country like ours has no choice. We've got to hit the road to keep bond investors informed - otherwise they'd forget about us,"" says O'Kelly, chief executive of the agency for almost six years, noting that Ireland accounts for less than than 1 per cent of both the world's gross domestic product (GDP) and most global bond indices.  But 2020 has been no ordinary year. And like the rest of the financial world, and beyond, the NTMA has had to enter the realm of virtual presentations - and simulating debt auctions from traders' sitting rooms - during Covid-19 to keep investors buying Irish.  The target has also moved. The NTMA originally set out to borrow EUR 10 billion-EUR 14 billion this year, mainly to finance the repayment of maturing debt as the Government looked on track for a third broadly-based budget in a row. It was forced to double the target in April to help fund unprecedented wage subsidies and Covid-19 unemployment benefits, health spending and other supports to deal with the pandemic. ""I think it is the first real counter-cyclical fiscal response by the State in its history,"" says O'Kelly, 60, of the use of stimulus to counteract the severe economic shock. ""In the last crisis, we were putting our foot on the brakes. This time we have the foot on the accelerator. It's a different beast - and it's the same right across Europe."" Could the last Government have done more in recent years to set aside money to help deal with an economic set-back?  While then minister for finance Michael Noonan first revealed plans in early 2016 to set up a rainy day fund, it was late last year before it was formally established. Its initial EUR 1.5 billion pot was tapped last month to help fund the EUR 17.8 billion budget expansion for 2021.   Recognising realpolitik The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said in May that the Government had squandered an opportunity by not setting aside some of the up to EUR 6 billion of temporary ""windfall"" corporate taxes flowing into its coffers in recent years. Using the money has helped fund the likes of a widening of income tax bands, boosting of youth unemployment benefits, and putting off plans to increase property taxes that are used to part finance local authorities. O'Kelly disagrees. ""I think the Government did quite a lot. We were in pretty good shape coming into this crisis. [The Government] was running a surplus coming into this. It's really the trajectory of heading towards budget balance that that bond markets want to see. But they recognise realpolitik,"" says O'Kelly.  ""And you don't want to be running your economy and society for bond investors. That's not a good idea, either.""  Still, O'Kelly said that Ireland needs to be prepared for a recession and some sort of a crisis every decade.  ""The question in Ireland that we should be asking is: what sort of shape are we going to be in when it comes around? We're a small, open economy and we get buffeted. Looking at even the recent 40 to 50 years of economic history, it looks like once every 10 years, on average, we could get hit by something that we didn't think of."" ""I think it's worth remembering that in four or five years' time. And that'll be the reason that we want to get our house in order at some point in the future.""  The Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath have committed to outlining next spring how they plan to cut the budget deficit in the years ahead.  The main reason, of course, why bond markets haven't baulked at the runaway pandemic bills across Europe - either from national spending or the ground-breaking EUR 750 billion EU virus recovery stimulus plan - has been the European Central Bank (ECB).  Under the leadership of Christine Lagarde since late 2019, the ECB committed this year to buying up to EUR 1.35 trillion of bonds in the market as governments raise cash to fight the effect of Covid-19 on their economies and health systems. The bank has also provided ultra-cheap loans to banks to keep money flowing.  'Notoriously obtuse  ' ""The ECB are saying as specifically as they possibly can - and central bankers are usually notoriously obtuse - that they are here to underwrite the recovery, and to allow governments to pull hard on the fiscal lever,"" said O'Kelly, adding that the central bank's bond-buying drive is essentially matching the amount of debt that governments are raising across the euro zone.  ""The net requirement of investors to purchase this additional supply is almost non-existent."" This means that the normal market force of bond market investors - including pension and investment funds - demanding higher rates, or yields, to absorb a glut of bonds being sold has been short-circuited.  ""[The ECB] are also essentially saying to governments, 'We're going to give you plenty of time to get your house back in order afterwards'. And that time is more valuable to sovereigns and governments than actual interest rates on their own."" It's just as well, as the Republic's debt pile, which had come in from a peak of 123 per cent of GDP in 2013 to 57 per cent last year, is set to widen to almost 67 per cent in 2021, according to Government forecasts. That's even with multinationals - led by tech and pharma groups, who have done well in the pandemic - propping up the GDP figure. The debt ratio relative to the underlying domestic economy is projected to blow out from 95 per cent in 2019 to almost 115 per cent next year.  It's easy to get swamped by statistics discussing the NTMA. But some figures stand out. The ECB stimulus, on top of the bank's existing multitrillion-euro bond-buying programme over the past five years, means that the State's annual interest bill has fallen from a peak of EUR 7.5 billion in 2014 to less than EUR 4 billion currently as the average rate on national borrowings - currently at almost EUR 225 billion - has declined from more than 4 per cent to just 1.6 per cent.  The EUR 24 billion raised this year will cost EUR 50 million a year in interest payments - a rate of 0.02 per cent. Compare that to when the yields on Ireland's 10-year bonds peaked to more than 14 per cent during the global financial crisis.  O'Kelly declines to say how much the NTMA plans to raise in the bond markets in 2021, ahead of an official announcement next month. But the Government's Budget 2021 plan to run a EUR 20.5 billion deficit - based on no broadly-available coronavirus vaccine and a no-deal Brexit - provides a reference point.  As the stop-start talks over a future trade accord between the EU and UK enter a crucial stage this weekend, the Central Bank is forecasting that no-deal, resulting in a default to World Trading Organisation (WTO) tariffs on goods and other disruptions, would knock 2 percentage points off Irish GDP next year.  Even if an agreement is reached, there will be few winners from Brexit. Ireland won't be one of them. Still, there is little doubt that the presence of the ECB in the market in recent years has dissuaded ""bond market vigilante""-types from driving up Irish borrowing costs as they weigh the Brexit impact. News in the past few weeks that two pipeline Covid-19 vaccines, being developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, have proven more than 95 per cent effective in advanced clinical trials has prompted stock markets to price in a rapid economic recovery next year.  ""The money is talking and saying that by halfway through 2021, whether it's because of vaccines, or rapid testing, or medicine, or all of the above, that things will be in a better place - and that the economic impact of every future lockdown, if they happen . . . will be much less disruptive to economic activity,"" O'Kelly says.   Cash balances The NTMA chief signalled he has no plans to run down its cash reserves, which the Government projects will end the year at more than EUR 12 billion. ""I can't see Ireland ever running down those cash balances to, say, four or five [billion euro] or running just-in-time access the bond market system, which maybe some triple-A countries, like Germany, do. We're too vulnerable, too small and too dependent on overseas investors,"" he says.  The Republic enjoyed an eight-year stint among credit ratings agencies as an AAA-rated country in early days of the euro in the noughties, but was downgraded across the board during the financial crisis, to hit as low as ""junk"" status for a period at Moody's. It currently has a single-A rating among most of the agencies - putting it on a par with the likes of Poland, China and Iceland - though Standard & Poor's raised Ireland to AA a year ago for good behaviour.  Will the State ever rejoin the exclusive league of trip-A nations that currently includes countries such as Canada, Norway and, for two of the top three agencies, the US.  ""I don't think we're big enough or a powerful enough country to ever get to triple-A,"" says O'Kelly. ""But I'm much more interested in being triple-A with investors than I am with rating agencies. Our bonds trade closer to a double-A than a single-A. I think where we are now is a fantastic position for Ireland. When you think about where we have come from, it's a pretty extraordinary story."" O'Kelly's selection by Noonan for the NTMA gig in late 2014 surprised many in Dublin financial circles, as speculation had centred around figures like John Moran, former Department of Finance sectary general, and Brendan McDonagh, a long-standing official at the debt agency who had led Nama since its inception in 2009.  But O'Kelly spent much of his career in the bond or fixed-income markets. After graduating with a business degree from Trinity College Dublin in 1982, he left for Japan to learn the language for six months before undertaking a masters in Japanese commercial policy at Senshu University in Tokyo and joining Barclays local investment banking unit.  ""This was the early 1980s. You were going to get on a plane and go somewhere. It was just a question of where you were going. Youth unemployment would probably have been 40 per cent at that stage in Ireland. It wasn't as risky a move as it sounds. The opportunity cost was zero. And you've got to remember that Japan was an economic superpower at the time and when I came out of college the financial markets were just opening up.""  Management buyout   O'Kelly left Japan after five years to work for Barclays in London and, for a period, in New York. In 1995, he returned to Ireland to run the fixed-income desk at stockbroker NCB, which had been sold the year before by its founder, Dermot Desmond, to Ulster Bank. In 2003, O'Kelly, by then NCB's chief executive, led a management buyout of the country's then third-largest brokerage - a deal ultimately backed by the empire-building Sean Quinn taking an initial 20 per cent stake. South African finance house Investec's Irish unit, led by Michael Cullen, took over NCB in early 2012 in a deal worth about EUR 32 million, leaving O'Kelly with the official title of deputy chairman but little doubt that there could only be one boss. There was little to lose when he was asked to consider throwing his hat into the ring for the NTMA job to succeed crisis-era leader John Corrigan.  The NTMA's vastly-expanded remit since it was set up 30 years ago means that O'Kelly is also responsible for the likes of the State Claims Agency, the NewEra body that advises the Government on commercial semi-state bodies, Nama, and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), a successor to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Today's ultra-low interest rates environment may be helping the NTMA's borrowing efforts. But it has been a big reason why almost EUR 9.5 billion has been wiped off the value of ISIF's investments in the State's three surviving bailed-out banks over the past five years. The effects of Brexit uncertainty and the coronavirus have only added to the sector's woes, leaving the value of the combined three stakes at a little over EUR 3 billion.  Was the Government wrong in ignoring O'Kelly's calls in mid-2018 to sell down the bank holdings? He pauses before choosing his words carefully.  ""I don't really want to comment on that. But, let's say, that ship has sailed.""  For the foreseeable future, at least. ",1,geopolitics,brexit,,,,uk
27,Irish Independent,02/10/2013,"(EURO)6,000 a year - the hit taken by families; Families down (EURO)6,000 a year after tax hikes","FAMILIES are now paying an extra (EURO)6,000 a year into the State's coffers, with the tax on their incomes jumping more than 50pc over the five years of austerity. Massive cuts in child benefit, the introduction of the controversial universal social charge, the property tax and rising prices for everything from groceries to energy has put Middle Ireland under huge financial pressure. Families are now at least (EURO)6,000 worse off a year due to a string of tough Budgets, an analysis by accountancy firm Grant Thornton has found. When other changes are added in, the bill rises to (EURO)10,000 a year. The changes in taxes and cuts to child benefit alone have seen a typical family, with both parents earning (EURO)40,000, lose (EURO)6,130 a year. This works out at (EURO)511 a month less in spending for a family with two children and a (EURO)200,000 mortgage, which is making a modest pension contribution. Continued on Page 4 Continued from Page 1 Those couples on (EURO)40,000 each have seen the tax take rise by more than 50pc. Middle-income earners have paid a huge price to restore the country to financial stability, tax partner Peter Vale of Grant Thornton said. A one-income couple on (EURO)40,000 now ends up with (EURO)300 less a month than they did five years ago. This works out at almost (EURO)3,600 a year. Mr Vale said low and middleincome earners were paying the heaviest price for the (EURO)28bn in tax and expenditure cuts introduced since 2008. ""While five years of austerity were necessary to restore economic stability, it's clear that low to middle-income earners have paid a heavier price in terms of the percentage increase in taxes they pay."" He said it was no surprise that consumer spending remained weak and the strength of any economic recovery uncertain, with so much disposable income sucked out of the economy to shore up the Government's finances. Budget And he predicted more tax hits in this month's Budget. These are likely to include higher savings tax, changes to PRSI (pay related social insurance) and increases in excise duty. The Budget is also likely to see a reduction in tax reliefs for putting money into a pension and rises in capital gains taxes. It will be the seventh austerity Budget. Mr Vale said: ""It's also worth noting that the effective tax rate for well-off families has risen close to 40pc, with high-earning professionals likely seeing their disposable income down by a minimum of (EURO)10,000 since 2008."" Middle-income families have been hit by a string of harsh expenditure cuts and hikes in taxes and charges. These include: ? The introduction of the universal social charge costs a typical two-income family more than (EURO)4,000 a year. . ? Multiple cuts in child benefit have seen a two-child family get (EURO)864 less in these payments a year. . ? The combination cost of electricity and gas has seen families shelling out an extra (EURO)460 a year in the past two years, according to energy comparison site www.Bonkers.ie. . ? Family grocery bills are now close to (EURO)900 a year higher than two years ago, according to Consumers' Association research. ? Health insurance premiums have doubled since the start of the downturn, with the average family now paying (EURO)2,500 a year. . ? Fees and charges costing up to (EURO)120 a year have been reintroduced by the main banks. . ? Property tax is set to cost the average family (EURO)300 a year from January. . ? Householders have also been hit by the introduction of carbon taxes, excise duty rises, changes to PRSI, higher motor tax, student registration charges and the loss of the early childhood supplement. And taxpayers will again be forced to pay for the financial mess the country is in when Finance Minister Michael Noonan stands up to deliver his Budget a week next Tuesday. Mr Vale said: ""While there will be ongoing political debate about whether the total Budget package should be (EURO)3.1bn or a lower amount, the conclusion is still the same. ""Taxpayers will dig deeper into their pockets in 2014 than they have in any year since the crisis started."" Chairman of the Consumers' Association Michael Kilcoyne said ordinary people needed a break after enduring six austerity Budgets. ""The Government has succeeded in turning middleincome people into low-income people. There is no middle-class left outside the banks,"" Mr Kilcoyne said. The latest research on the impact of austerity on families came after the Irish Tax Institute said workers in this country already paid the high rate of income tax on far more of their income than other countries.

28,The Irish Times,04/12/2003,"10,300 civil servants to leave Dublin (Part 1)No longer will policy be made entirely in Dublin on the basis of a Dublin mindset, says McCreevy","Introduction This Budget comes at a turning point in our economic prospects, when international growth is on the mend. As such, it will set the strategic direction which this country will follow for the next few years. Ireland has come through the recent international economic downturn better than most. This is in no small part due to our sound budgetary policies. It is easy to forget the progress we have achieved - the defeat of unemployment as an economic scourge, the doubling of real income in the economy, the massive investment in infrastructure, and the substantial enhancement of social benefits for the welfare of all our people. Today many tend to take these achievements for granted. Even if we sometimes forget the progress we have made over recent years, other fair-minded and reputable international organisations have no difficulty in reminding us. The IMF report last August commended the Irish authorities for their ""exemplary track record of sound economic policies"". The IMF referred to our enviable achievements: - unemployment reduced from 16 per cent to 4 per cent; - huge gains in competitiveness; and 03120400179 - public debt reduced from over 100 per cent of GDP to 33 per cent. The IMF also praised not only our prudent fiscal management and our tax reforms but it also commended our sensible incomes policies and our investment in education. All of these policies have laid the foundation for a virtuous circle, reinforcing growth and strengthening the resilience of our economy. Budgetary and strategic objectives This Budget has the following basic objectives: - to foster employment and growth; - to continue a prudent approach to our public finances; - to invest more in infrastructure; and - to secure competitiveness by keeping inflation low, thereby giving us the resources to meet our commitments on social inclusion. The strategic elements of delivering on these objectives involve: - action to keep public spending within a sustainable growth range; - an initiative on capital investment; - action to sustain our public service pension capacity; - a balanced growth strategy for all areas of the State, which can be progressed through decentralisation. Economic outlook As I have reminded the House before, Ireland is part of a monetary union with a low inflation target. Competition worldwide is exerting downward pressure on prices and incomes. As an open economy we are more exposed than most and we face intensifying competition for international investment and the jobs that go with it. These facts mean that there is an urgency attaching to getting our costs and prices back into balance with the rest of the EU. In doing so, we must keep the rate of increase in public spending in line with how we expect revenues to grow. In 2004, I am providing for Exchequer borrowing of E2.8 billion. I believe that this is the appropriate level to set for Exchequer borrowing in the current circumstances. This is equivalent to over 50 per cent of our capital budget for the year. This time last year, I pointed to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. My caution was well placed, as the pick-up in the major world economies has been slower than expected. The current improvement in the international economy is a welcome development. However, there are still significant risks. For example, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to sharp falls in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro. On balance, the short-term prospects for the international economy have now improved. We need to ensure that we can capitalise on that improvement. At this point in time, GNP in 2004 is projected to grow at 3.0 per cent and GDP at 3.3 per cent. We also expect to see GNP growth rates increasing in 2005 and 2006 to about 4 per cent and 4-1/2 per cent, respectively. Employment is expected to grow next year by 23,000 with unemployment to average around 5 per cent. Taking account of the changes in this Budget, consumer price inflation should average 2-1/2 per cent in 2004, half the rate we experienced at the start of this year. Decentralisation of Government Departments and agencies It is important that the growth we expect should be regionally balanced. In this regard, I am today announcing details of decentralisation of Government Departments and agencies as promised in Budget 2000. For the first time ever, decentralisation will involve the transfer of complete Departments - including their ministers and senior management - to provincial locations. A total of eight Departments and the Office of Public Works will move their headquarters from Dublin to provincial locations, leaving seven Departments with their headquarters in Dublin. All Departments and Offices will be participating in the programme. Ministers with headquarters outside of Dublin will be provided with a centralised suite of offices, close to the Houses of the Oireachtas, for a small secretariat so they can conduct business while in Dublin and when the Dail is in session. The previous decentralisation programme involved the relocation of some 4,000 public service jobs. The programme I am announcing today is far more radical. In total, it will involve the relocation of 10,300 civil and public service jobs to 53 centres in 25 counties. Details of implementation Full details of the decentralisation programme are outlined in the Budget summary. The programme will be implemented through the transfer of staff on a voluntary basis. There will be no redundancies and, as on previous occasions, the payment of removal or relocation expenses will not arise. For the reasons outlined in the summary, decisions on location have yet to be made in relation to over 1,300 of the 10,300 jobs being decentralised. I also believe that the final total can be closer to 12,000 jobs and I intend to examine options in this regard once the new programme is well under way. The Government has also decided that, save in exceptional circumstances, any new agencies or bodies being established in future should be located in areas compatible with the new programme of decentralisation. I am establishing an implementation committee to drive forward implementation of the programme, with the chair of the committee reporting to a Cabinet sub-committee. I am also providing an additional E20 million capital in my Department's vote for 2004 to meet any up-front investment required. Benefits for all I believe that, over time, decentralisation will lead to a radical change of culture in terms of policy formation in this country. No longer will policy be made entirely in Dublin on the basis of a Dublin mindset. I am convinced that decentralisation offers considerable benefits for the Departments involved, the communities to which they will be relocated, the staff that will transfer and the country as a whole. The Government has sought to ensure that the units being transferred are large enough to provide career opportunities for staff either within their own Department or in another Department within a reasonable distance. Indeed, the radical nature of this programme means that capable civil servants who are interested in decentralisation can look forward with confidence to good career prospects outside Dublin in the future, something which has been much less a feature of decentralisation in the past. Decentralisation can bring very significant benefits for the staff involved. These benefits will include reduced commuting times and lower house prices outside Dublin. Discussions will be held with the public service unions on the programme. National Spatial Strategy The locations which have been selected take full account of the National Spatial Strategy, the existence of good transport links - by road, rail and/or air - and the location of existing decentralised offices. The aim has been to establish viable clusters of work units within a region, either in the form of self-contained locations or clusters of sites located geographically close to each other or to existing decentralised locations. This will help to avoid the pitfalls of fragmentation, and protect service delivery. Although Dublin remains vital to economic development, the Government's National Spatial Strategy recognised that Ireland also needs a more even spread of development. Unbalanced development is not sustainable in the longer term, economically, socially or environmentally. More balanced regional development will contribute to sustainable long-term economic growth to the benefit of all our citizens. Budgetary projections The 2004 Budgetary targets are as follows: - an increase in gross spending on public services of just under 7 per cent, bringing it to a total of E41,117 million; - a current Budget surplus of E2,989 million; - a capital Budget deficit of E5,795 million; - an Exchequer deficit of E2,806 million; - a general Government deficit of E1,635 million, or 1.1 per cent of GDP; and - a debt ratio of 33 per cent of GDP, the second lowest in the EU. Sustaining Progress One of the provisions agreed in Sustaining Progress was that the report of the independent Public Service Benchmarking Body would be implemented. The Government will honour that commitment. If we wish to deliver quality public services we have to pay the salaries necessary for their delivery. The key to this agreement is the fact that there will be gains for both sides. We now have a pay determination system which rewards public servants by reference to the market value of their work and does not depend on historical links with other public service groups. Furthermore, payment of the increases is conditional on industrial peace and progress on modernisation across the public service. Failure to deliver on these requirements will mean that payments will not be made. A further national pay agreement is due to be negotiated in the first half of 2004. These negotiations will have to take into account the facts that: - the competitive challenge is more intense than ever; - inflation has halved since the present agreement was negotiated; and - in the case of the public service, significant increases are being paid under benchmarking. As a consequence, we need a significantly lower outcome in pay terms than was the case the last time.",0,,,,,,
29,Irish Independent,21/12/2019,"12 months... 12 stories; 2019 was the year Brexit started to feel real; it was the year we bade farewell to Gay Byrne, the year of Swing-gate and the year of climate strikes and Greta Thunberg. Kim Bielenberg and John Meagher round up a dozen stories that got us talking most","A YEAR IN SPORT Record crowds for 'ladies' and five-in-a-row Fans of Dublin's Gaelic football team must have felt they were in dreamland in September when the county became the first ever to win five consecutive men's All-Ireland finals. They were hot favourites against Kerry but the Kingdom put it up to them. It went to a replay and there was no doubting Dublin's dominance. Manager Jim Gavin received many of the plaudits and there was some surprise in December when he stepped aside. New manager Dessie Farrell has big shoes to fill. Not everyone was thrilled about the Dubs' stranglehold over Gaelic football, with allegations of ""financial doping"" tainting their success in the eyes of some. In hurling, it was a great year for Tipperary. They may have been comprehensively beaten by defending champions Limerick in the Munster Final, but on All-Ireland day, the Premier County obliterated old enemy Kilkenny. There were record crowds for both the Ladies' Gaelic football final and the camogie final, with more than 56,000 attending the former - a wretchedly poor game played in awful conditions and won by Dublin. If there was plenty to cheer about in Gaelic games, rugby fans had little to enjoy in 2019. The year begun with enormous anticipation following the Grand Slam exploits and the defeat of New Zealand the previous season. The Six Nations tournament was a damp squib and pre-World Cup matches in the summer illustrated just how far the country had fallen (Ireland had been ranked number one in the world earlier in the year). But worse was to come. After suffering a shock defeat at the hands of host Japan in the World Cup, Joe Schmidt's men were obliterated by New Zealand in the quarter final. The tournament was eventually won by South Africa, managed by former Munster coach Rassie Erasmus. And there was disappointment for Leinster in the Champions Cup Final at Newcastle. They relinquished their crown to Saracens. In soccer, there wasn't a great deal to cheer either. The national team struggled to score in qualifying matches for next year's Euros - and failed to beat Denmark in Dublin in order to achieve automatic qualification. However, their performance on the night was widely hailed as the best in years. In domestic football, Dundalk demonstrated why they have been the finest club this side of the decade by winning the Airtricity League yet again. And it was a year to remember for Shamrock Rovers, as they Rovers, as they lifted the FAI Cup for the first time since 1987. For Irish football fans, though, it was events off the pitch that dominated headlines (see the entry on John Delaney on page 6). On a more positive note, Ciara Mageean finished in the 1,500m top 10 in the World Athletics Championships in the controversial setting of Doha. She will be one to watch in next year's Tokyo Olympics. - JM Continued on Page 4 RTÉ Full extent of financial crisis emerges at national broadcaster At the end of November, Ryan Tubridy presided over what many people consider to have been the best-ever Late Late Toy Show. It seemed to perfectly judge the mood of the nation and gave a wide berth to the materialism of yesteryear. And the host's empathy was in evidence in a beautiful interview with eight-year-old Dublin girl Sophia Maher who talked about the bullying she had experienced because she wanted to look different to everyone else. It was one of the few occasions in 2019 when RTÉ was in the news for positive reasons. Earlier this month, for instance, Tubridy and the Late Late was under fire for creating a special pub set for a tribute show on Shane MacGowan - but that was in the ha'penny place compared to the nightmare that the national broadcaster never seemed to wake up from this year. It had long been known that RTÉ was struggling financially, especially with the Government refusing to sanction an increase in the licence fee, as well as seismic changes in the media landscape over the past decade which have resulted in plummeting advertising revenues. But the extent of the problems became apparent when director general Dee Forbes announced a raft of cost-saving measures. There would be pay cuts for all staff and the abolition of digital radio stations while the highest earners - household names all - would have to face a 15pc cut in their salaries. The NUJ chapel in RTÉ later proposed that the top pay should not exceed (EURO)208,000 - a move that has, apparently, caused much friction in Montrose. The death of legendary broadcaster Gay Byrne came around the time of Forbes' proposed cost-cutting - and it served to remind those in RTÉ and the wider public of a time of plenty when Byrne could command 800,000 listeners every morning on his radio show and advertisers were queueing up to spend their money. It was a challenging time for other areas of the media, too. The Irish print edition of The Times was wound up in May just a couple of years after launching amid much fanfare. Meanwhile, one of the newer kids on the block, Maximum Media -publisher of www.Joe.ie and www.Her.ie - found itself in the firing line after it emerged that it had used so-called ""click farms"" in order to boost audience figures for some of its podcasts. One of the country's largest media buying agencies said it would look elsewhere and, in an effort to stem the tide, founder Niall McGarry said he was stepping away from the Irish operation. - JM UK ELECTION After Theresa's stumbles, Boris wins with pledge to 'get Brexit done' It was a dramatic turnaround for a Conservative Party that had been deeply divided and in disarray over the UK government's botched plans to leave the European Union this year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson emerged victorious in a general election in December as voters rewarded him with a commanding majority and a new mandate to leave the EU at the end of January 2020. He had earlier been cast as a buffoon, unfit to lead his country, but Johnson's simple promise to ""get Brexit done'', and widespread unease with the style and policies of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn combined to give the Conservatives their best performance since Margaret Thatcher's victory in 1987. Earlier in the year, Theresa May had steadfastly tried to win members of parliament over to a withdrawal agreement from the EU. But she had to rely on the DUP to prop up the government, and in the early months of the year she found it impossible to command the support of the House of Commons. She appeared to lack any skills as a dealmaker, capable of forging an alliance in parliament. Britain's departure from the EU was postponed three times during the year, twice during her premiership. The main sticking point for many Conservative MPs and the DUP was the backstop. This was a guarantee in the withdrawal agreement designed to ensure there would be no border posts or barriers in Ireland after Brexit. If it had been needed, the backstop would have kept the UK in a close trading relationship with the EU, thus avoiding checks. Parliament's opposition to her deal eventually led to May's resignation and the eventual election of Boris Johnson as party leader. When he arrived in Downing Street, Johnson took a more aggressive, bullish approach to parliament. Parliament was prorogued, or suspended, for over a month, but the Supreme Court ruled that the prorogation was unlawful. At times during the year, the shenanigans in Westminster led to uncertainty over the future of the Irish border and what would happen if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. Boris Johnson negotiated a revised deal with the EU. The backstop has been replaced with new customs arrangements. The revised plan effectively creates a customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Britain. Under this convoluted arrangement, some goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain would have to pay EU import tariffs. These would be refunded if goods remained in Northern Ireland (that is if they are not moved south of the border). This version of the backstop was anathema to the DUP, who effectively snookered themselves by putting their trust in the Conservatives. Intent on an election, Boris eventually had no use for the unionists - and the party's support declined in the election. For the first time ever, the election results showed nationalist MPs outnumbering unionists in the six counties. - KB CLIMATE CHANGE Greta effect inspires Green wave with best-ever result at elections he 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg was the unlikely i n s p i r a t i o n f o r a y o u t h f u l movement for action on climate change. THer high-profile appeals for global measures to tackle the emergency contributed to a resurgence in the Irish Green Party at local and European elections in May. At the European elections, the Green Party won two seats and 11.4pc of the vote, its best nationwide performance in any election. Ciarán Cuffe topped the poll in Dublin, and he was joined in the European parliament by Grace O'Sullivan, who was elected in the South constituency. The Green Party also enjoyed sweeping gains in the local elections, with the number of elected councillors increasing from 12 to 49. They became the second biggest party on Dublin City Council. Throughout the year, Greta was seldom out of the headlines, because she delivered simple, well-articulated messages through words as well as actions. She told the World Economic Forum in Davos: ""I don't want your hope. I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day, and then I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is."" In August, she sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on a yacht to attend a UN summit on zero emissions. And she sailed in the other direction to Portugal for another UN conference in Madrid. In the previous year, she was described as a frail and lonely figure when she started a school strike for the climate outside the Swedish parliament building. But her strike snowballed into an international movement in 2019, with schoolchildren across the world following her example. In September, thousands of Irish schoolchildren took to the streets as protests were held across Ireland and across the world. In Dublin, more than 10,000 children and young people gathered in the city centre for a demonstration. Placard slogans included: ""I've seen smarter cabinets in Ikea"", ""There is no planet B"", and ""The dinosaurs also thought they had time."" Inevitably, Greta Thunberg's campaign irked climate-change sceptics such as US President Donald Trump. He tweeted: ""Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old-fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"" The pigtailed teenager has Asperger syndrome, a form of autism, where people may have difficulties in social interaction. Responding to her critics, Thunberg said on social media: ""When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you're winning! I have Asperger's and that means I'm sometimes a bit different from the norm. And - given the right circumstances - being different is a superpower."" Despite these protests and ambitious government targets, measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have been slow to materialise. A hike in carbon taxes was announced in the budget, as well as the closure of power stations that use peat to generate electricity. - KB ANA KRIÉGEL Young girl's murder trial throws spotlight on porn and cyberbullying It was among the most distressing court cases in the history of the State - and the Ana Kriégel trial wore on for eight long weeks in the Central Criminal Court. Ana - a 14-year-old schoolgirl - was tortured and murdered close to her family home in Co Kildare. The perpetrators were her 13-yearold classmates - who, due to being under 18, can only be identified as Boy A and Boy B. The details of her death seemed to have been drawn from a horror film. Ana was lured away from her home by Boy B and brought to an abandoned building where Boy A was waiting. He proceeded to tie her up and beat her savagely. Boy A was sentenced to a term of life on the first count of murder and will serve an initial 12 years, followed by a review. The sentence may be extended after the first 12 years served. Boy A was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault. A term of 12 years was also imposed for that count, to be served concurrently. Boy B was sentenced to 15 years for murder, with the sentence to be reviewed after eight years. Both were incarcerated in Oberstown Children Detention Campus and will be transferred to adult prisons when they turn 18. According to Justice Paul McDermott, it was a ""murder of the most serious, shocking and disturbing"" kind. During the case, it emerged that Boy A was a voracious consumer of online pornography - much of it of an extreme variety. It led to something of a national conversation on how porn has become so readily available to children as young as eight. A previous generation would have to run the gamut of the family computer in order to get their fix, but now - with smartphone use by children among the highest in the EU - a huge selection of hardcore porn is available 24/7 on their phones. The trial also highlighted the scourge of cyberbullying. Poor Ana Kriégel did not just suffer a horrendous death; it emerged that she was also relentlessly bullied by other children. Much of the focus of the torment was centred on social media platforms, including Snapchat and Instagram. In a victim impact statement, her mother Geraldine told the court about the never-ending pain that arrived from the moment the child was murdered on May 14, 2018. ""Life without Ana is no longer a life, nor is it even an existence - it is a misery that we must endure for the rest of our lives."" - JM Continued on Page 6 'MR MOONLIGHT' Continued from Page 5 LISA SMITH From Syria to Limerick Prison If the horrors perpetrated by Isis have felt like they happened a world away from Ireland, the actions of this most hated group felt a bit closer to home in 2019. A former solider in the Irish Army, Lisa Smith was this year taken into custody on suspicion that she was a member of the terror group that came to prominence earlier this decade. Smith has denied these allegations and said she merely wanted to live in the Islamic State region and follow the teachings of the Koran. The Dundalk native was a member of the Irish Defence Forces before transferring to the Irish Air Corps where she served as a flight attendant on the government jet during the tenure of former taoiseach Bertie Ahern. She converted to Islam after the breakdown of her marriage and travelled to Syria in 2015. She was captured and detained by US forces in northern Syria earlier this year. She was at that point caring for a toddler. She spoke to reporter Norma Costello from the detention camp she was incarcerated in, claiming to be innocent and wishing to return home. There was considerable disquiet from some when it emerged the Government would attempt to repatriate Smith and her child. Despite that, the Government did repatriate her and she was immediately arrested when she landed at Dublin Airport. After extensive questioning, she was detained for several weeks in Limerick Prison before being granted bail. - JM SWING-GATE Maria Bailey faces life on sidelines after 'errors of judgment' The Dún Laoghaire Fine Gael TD Maria Bailey found herself embroiled in controversy when the Irish Independent revealed in May that she had filed a personal injury claim over a fall from a swing at Dublin's Dean Hotel in 2015. The revelation, just days before the local and European elections, caused significant public controversy amidst ongoing criticism of the Government's failure to tackle rising insurance premiums. Bailey's lawsuit included a claim the hotel was liable for the accident because the swing was 'unsupervised'. Legal papers lodged by the hotel show it had counter argued that she was holding items in both hands at the time of the fall. It was subsequently revealed that Bailey had taken part in a 10km race three weeks after the swing fall. She had lodged papers on the basis that she had suffered injuries to her head, lower back and hip after falling backward off a swing. Soon after the story broke, the TD took part in a now infamous radio interview with Sean O'Rourke. It only seemed to inflame the controversy and caused dismay within Fine Gael. A report by a senior counsel found that Culture Minister Josepha Madigan, who was then a backbench TD, gave initial legal advice to Bailey and helped her colleague with her application to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Bailey was advised she had a ""stateable"" case. The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that there were ""inconsistencies"" in Bailey's account of events to him and the media that he could not reconcile. He also said she had made ""numerous errors of judgment"". Bailey said she regretted taking the case but had acted on legal advice throughout the process. The Taoiseach sacked her as chair of the Oireachtas Housing Committee in July. The matter came to a head in the autumn when party members in Dún Laoghaire voted in favour of an urgent review of the constituency's election candidates. In November, Fine Gael removed her from the general election ticket in Dún Laoghaire. The controversy brought personal injuries payouts and claims that there is a pervasive compensation culture to the fore. Senator Michael McDowell highlighted the controversy surrounding Bailey's personal-injury action when he raised the matter in the Seanad. McDowell said: ""If the Government is serious about driving down the claims culture, we cannot stand idly by when adults lose their seat with two objects, one in each hand, and fall off a swing and then claim that there should have been a supervisor looking after them."" - KB JOHN DELANEY Tennis balls on the pitch as FAI chief finally succumbs to storm In April, John Delaney of Football Association of Ireland appeared before the Dáil's Public Accounts Committee. He was there to answer questions about a (EURO)100,000 bridging loan he had given the association that had come to light following a Sunday Times investigation. Delaney, who had been CEO but was now in a specially created new position of executive vice-president, was in typically bullish mood as he sat in front of an all-party panel of TDs. And he had little interest in cooperating. ""I am not in a position,"" he said, ""to answer any such questions at this time... given that some members of this committee have made highly prejudicial public pronouncements about me personally prior to my attendance here today."" Sinn Féin's Imelda Munster captured the incredulity of those present when she said: ""The former CEO has behaved disgracefully today. It's been farcical. The only good thing is that the public out there have witnessed it."" Delaney had already earned the ire of the general public. The previous month, in a Euro 2020 qualifier against Georgia, tennis balls had been thrown on the pitch in protest at the way the FAI was governed. But it would soon emerge - thanks to tenacious journalism from Mark Tighe and others - that the bridging Ioan was merely the tip of the iceberg when it came to how Delaney ran the organisation. Not only was Delaney enjoying a salary of (EURO)360,000 - more than three times the prize money for winners of the League of Ireland - but the association was also paying his (EURO)3,000 monthly rent. Furthermore, some (EURO)60,000 was spent on his 50th birthday party, and separately, the same amount was paid to a former girlfriend, too. The questions kept mounting up, but Delaney tried to ride out the storm - and, in the early days of the revelations, tried to get a court order to stop newspapers publishing details. Eventually, he stepped aside but not before negotiating a generous severance package for himself. At the beginning of the month, the full extent of the FAI's problems became clear after an independent audit. The organisation is in debt to the tune of at least (EURO)55m and will likely not be free of that debt until 2030. Now, employees face an uncertain Christmas with the threat of job losses hanging over them. It was one of several scandals involving money and people in power. Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy claimed more than (EURO)50,000 in annual expenses despite being largely absent in the Dáil for two years. His party colleague, Health Minister Simon Harris, called on him to give the money back. Murphy has remained silent on the matter although he did show up in Leinster House in order to support Eoghan Murphy in the no-confidence vote taken against him. 'Murphygate' came around the time that it emerged that a printer, purchased at great expense for the houses of the Oireachtas, was too big to get through the door. Only in Ireland? - JM Murderer motivated by 'love and money' gets life for killing rival After the longest murder trial in the history of the State, the Tipperary farmer Pat Quirke was convicted by a majority jury verdict of 10-2 at the Central Criminal Court. The prosecution successfully built a case that Quirke killed the popular quarry worker and DJ Bobby Ryan, known as Mr Moonlight, driven by jealousy and greed. Quirke staged the discovery of Bobby Ryan's body, which had been dumped in a hidden run-off tank on Mary Lowry's farm at Fawnagown. Lowry was Bobby Ryan's girlfriend. She had previously been in a secret relationship with Quirke, her late husband's brother-in-law. The trial lasted for 15 weeks and Quirke was handed the mandatory life sentence for murder. The prosecution alleged Quirke was motivated by ""love and money"" to kill Bobby Ryan and dump his body. It said Quirke killed his victim so he could rekindle his affair with Mary Lowry, the widow whose farm he was leasing. This was denied by Quirke, who attempted to deflect attention on to Mary Lowry when he was interviewed by gardaí. Lowry had what she described as a ""seedy"" and ""sordid"" affair with Quirke between 2008 and 2010 and gave him financial assistance. But she was in a relationship with Bobby Ryan, a father-of-two, by the time of his disappearance. The jury had heard that Ryan vanished after leaving Lowry's house at 6.30am on June 3, 2011. His body was discovered 22 months later by Quirke in an underground tank on the farm, but the prosecution alleged this was a ""staged"" discovery. The verdict brought an end to a case which was almost entirely based on circumstantial evidence. There was no murder weapon, no murder scene was identified and the case was described as being ""forensically barren"". However, the prosecution argued there was a lot of circumstantial evidence. Taken in isolation, each piece of evidence may merely have aroused suspicion. But the prosecution successfully argued that when woven together, the various strands of circumstantial evidence proved Quirke's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The jury was told Quirke was one of only four people who knew of the existence of the tank where the body was dumped and he had exclusive access to it. Mary Lowry testified that Quirke looked ""hot and bothered"" when she had seen him in the farmyard on the morning of Ryan's disappearance. On April 30, 2013, Quirke claimed to have ""discovered"" Mr Ryan's remains in the run-off tank. But his behaviour afterwards aroused suspicions. The phone records confirmed Quirke rang his wife Imelda rather than ringing gardaí after seeing the body in the tank. ""I don't think he was shocked or afraid for one moment,"" prosecution counsel Michael Bowman SC told the jury. The trial also heard there were internet searches for ""human body decomposition"" found on a computer taken from Quirke's house in the months before the body was recovered. - KB Continued on Page 8 Jealousy: Pat Quirke, who was convicted of murdering Bobby Ryan, AKA Mr Moonlight Continued from Page 7 POLITICS Housing and beef: a year of discontent There are protests and then there are chaos-causing protests with four-wheel drive tractors that gridlock an entire city. At the end of November when farmers brought their grievance about the low price they were being paid for their beef, everybody knew about it. Then they targeted the meat depots used by the country's largest supermarkets. And, then, a week before Christmas, they were back on the streets of Dublin to remind the Minster for Agriculture and the general public that they simply weren't being paid the same price per kilo that their Northern Irish counterparts enjoy. 2019 may not have been a year of street protests to rival that of the early 1980s, but there was a great deal of discontent on the ground. And much of it was aimed at a government that appeared to be running on empty for much of the year. There was fury about hospital waiting lists - which included an Irish Independent front page story from this month about a boy with cancer who has had to wait for chemotherapy treatment - as well as the escalating cost of the National Children's Hospital, which is currently under construction. EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATION But the topic that seemed to be on almost everyone's lips this year was homelessness. More than 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation right now - a figure that has surged in the eight years that Fine Gael have been in power. The year ended with over 4,000 children who are officially homeless. There were heart-rending accounts of the developmental difficulties experienced by children in such accommodation - everything from a difficulty with chewing thanks to a dependence on soft foods (due to the policy of some hotels not to allow residents to cook in their rooms), inability to walk at the correct age and troubles with nappy weaning. And homelessness in Ireland got an overseas audience when a five-yearold boy was photographed sitting on a cardboard box on Grafton Street eating a bowl of pasta. He was one of the youngest people served by the Homeless Street Café, which operates in the country's most famous shopping street every Tuesday night. And he and his mother have become frequent visitors to this pop-up soup kitchen. Often, it is the only hot meal he gets to eat that day. A UN report this year may have suggested that Ireland was the third best country in the world in which to live, but for a growing cohort of our population, the reality could not be further away. -JM BRITISH ROYALS Epstein scandal leads to another royal annus horribilis t has been another annus horribilis for the British royal family, as they continued to attract publicity for the wrong reasons. IWhile viewers watched the historical drama about Elizabeth's reign in the Netflix series, The Crown, the up-to-date real life soap opera played out in news reports. It started with Prince Philip's Land Rover crashing into another car near the Sandringham Estate, injuring a motorist - and it all went downhill from there. Prince Harry and Meghan found themselves targeted by the tabloids, and the year reached an absolute low point with Prince Andrew's calamitous interview with the BBC in November about his dealings with the deceased and disgraced tycoon, Jeffrey Epstein. Accusations against the prince about having sex with a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre had been public for many months. She alleged in a September interview that Epstein enslaved her as a teenager and facilitated sexual encounters between her and the Duke of York. The duke has always denied any form of sexual contact. These were among the most serious allegations ever made against a member of the royal family in modern times, but for much of the year the tabloid press was fixated on the minor peccadilloes of Prince Harry's wife, Meghan. She was criticised for living an opulent lifestyle, which may be hard to avoid if you become part of the royal family. This led Prince Harry to come to Meghan's defence. He lambasted the ""relentless propaganda"" by a ""press pack that has vilified her almost daily for the past nine months"". Eventually, the attention switched back to Prince Andrew when he gave his BBC interview with Emily Maitlis. During the interview, he gave a string of reasons as to why Virginia Giuffre's accusations were false, including the fact that her account of him sweating while dancing at a nightclub could not be true because he suffered from a medical condition which stops him perspiring. This led one New York tabloid to carry the banner headline on its front page: ""HIS ROYAL DRYNESS."" Failing to sympathise with Epstein's victims in his interview, Andrew did not express regret about his friendship with the sex offender. In fact, as he suggested, he found it useful for the connections he made. Regardless of whether he had a sexual encounter with Virginia Giuffre when she was underage, his continued association with Epstein after the tycoon was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution inevitably led to Andrew becoming a royal pariah. Eventually, he was forced to step back from royal duties after he was effectively dismissed by the queen. - KB LYRA McKEE 'A brilliant light has gone out' On a Thursday night in April, the 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee was at the centre of a riot on the streets of Derry. She posted her final Twitter post showing a police vehicle being pelted by petrol bombs with the caption: ""Derry tonight. Absolute madness."" She was killed shortly afterwards, shot dead by a gunman firing towards police as trouble flared in the Creggan area. Police said the gunman was a member of the New IRA, a tiny paramilitary group that opposed the Good Friday Agreement. Reporting from the scene, the journalist Leona O'Neill said: ""Bystanders screamed at rioters 'look what you have done' through www.tears.No one could believe a young woman had been cut down in their streets."" Born in Belfast just a few years before the 1998 accord was struck to end the kind of violence that took her life, Lyra was remembered in an outpouring of tributes as an intelligent, talented writer who brought a human touch to difficult subjects. McKee wrote and spoke openly about the struggles of growing up gay in a hostile environment. A 2014 blog post - 'A Letter to my 14-Year-Old Self' - received much acclaim and was subsequently turned into a short film. By that stage, McKee had already been named Sky News Young Journalist of the Year - an award she won in 2006 - and was named as one of the ""30 under 30 in media"" by Forbes magazine 10 years later. She wrote for publications both in Northern Ireland and aboard, including the UK's Independent newspaper. In 2018, McKee had signed a two-book deal with British publisher Faber and Faber. She was writing a book on the disappearance of young people during the Troubles. In a story published by the Mosaic Science website in 2016 that was widely shared on social media, McKee had explored why in Northern Ireland more people took their own lives in the first 16 years after the so-called Troubles ended than died during them. ""We were the Good Friday Agreement generation, destined to never witness the horrors of war but to reap the spoils of peace,"" she wrote. ""The spoils just never seemed to reach us."" The landmark Free Derry Corner was marked by graffiti to reflect the revulsion felt at the killing of Lyra. The famous civil rights-era slogan on a gable wall is regularly altered to reflect community sentiment in the Bogside. A message on the wall said ""Not in our name, RIP Lyra"" with a heart painted beside it. Leona O'Neill wrote in her piece in the Irish Independent in the days after the killing: ""A brilliant light has gone out and Northern Ireland is a much darker place today without her."" - KB After suffering a shock defeat at the hands of host Japan in the World Cup, Joe Schmidt's men were obliterated by New Zealand in the quarter final The NUJ chapel in RTÉ later proposed that the top pay should not exceed (EURO) 208,000 'I don't want your hope.

30,The Irish Times,08/10/2008,1980s-style budget required - ESRI,"BUDGET 2009:HIGHER TAXES may be ""unavoidable"" if public services are to be maintained, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) said yesterday, as it advised the Government to implement its toughest budget since the 1980s. The Government should raise EUR 3 billion through severe cuts in spending and tax hikes in the budget, even though these measures will drag the economy further into recession, the ESRI said in its latest quarterly commentary. The Government should aim to stabilise the general Government deficit at 5.5 per cent of GDP in Budget 2009, according to ESRI senior research officer Alan Barrett. ""We need the public finances to be on a broadly sustainable path,"" he said. ""Ideally, it would have been preferable for the Government to avoid adding to the downturn through a fiscal contraction. However, given the poor state of the public finances and the uncertainties surrounding the prospects for the economy, we think that the 5.5 per cent level is prudent."" As this deficit would mean that the budget would have to be one of the most deflationary of the last quarter-century, the Government may settle for running a higher deficit, Mr Barrett said. The ESRI's illustration of how the Government could save EUR 3 billion includes a 15 per cent cut in capital spending, unchanged expenditure on goods and services and a rise in the average personal tax rate from 19.5 per cent to 19.8 per cent. ""Whatever decisions are made in the short run, the longer-run situation with regard to tax increases will need to be reflected upon. Increased public spending was facilitated in recent years by property-related tax windfalls that are now drying up,"" the ESRI noted. ""Even when Ireland returns to its long-run growth path, it may well be the case that tax revenues are not sufficient to fund levels of public services which are (in some social sense) considered optimal.""",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
31,The Irish Times,09/02/2013,2053: What does the 40-year payback mean?,"After years of economic turmoil and social distress, is the new deal with the ECB a turning point for Ireland? The deal to restructure the debts of Anglo Irish Bank clears a major political and financial hurdle for the Government as it prepares to break free of the international bailout later this year. Although huge challenges remain to be overcome in the months ahead, the new arrangement with the European Central Bank relieves some of the debt burden on the beleaguered Irish people. The immediate impact for the public is minimal. There will be no getting away from painful new taxes on property and water, for example. This year s budget remains intact, but some benefits will be felt from next year. To meet European targets in the next two years, the Government had been due to cut the budget by a further EUR 5.1 billion: EUR 3.1 billion in 2014 and EUR 2 billion in 2015. The Coalition now expects to reduce the total by EUR 1 billion in that period, easing some but not all of the pressure to scale back expenditure and increase the tax take. In a hostile political environment, with the Government s popularity on the wane, this is welcome room for manoeuvre. As T\x90naiste Eamon Gilmore revved up international pressure for a deal, the argument was quietly made in Government circles that it would be very difficult for Ministers to agree to a new swathe of budget cuts this autumn if the promissory notes were not recast. The deal means the Government will not have to shell out EUR 3.l billion at the end of March, nor another EUR 3.1 billion in June to meet a liability to Bank of Ireland under an arrangement to defer last year s bill. A further EUR 3.1 was to fall due in March 2014, meaning the Government was faced with paying no less than EUR 9.3 billion into a bust bank in the space of 13 months. At the same time, a big reduction in the State s titanic borrowing requirement in the years to come means it will be easier for the Government to persuade private investors that Irish sovereign debt is again a good bet. The benefits here are twofold. First, the likelihood of the Government being less indebted should ease concerns about its ability to repay debt. Second, the consequent increase in demand for Irish bonds should reduce the interest the Government must pay when selling debt to investors.  It s not that paradise starts tomorrow. It s not heaven on earth all of a sudden. It s a good first step in the process towards exiting from the programme, says a central-banking source who knows the Irish scene. In this respect the deal should bring Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Gilmore closer to taking charge of Ireland s affairs, and reduce the influence of the troika. Intrusive external surveillance will be a fact of life for ever in the euro zone, so economic sovereignty is a diminished and limited thing these days. But it would still be a huge boost to take Ireland away from its morale-sapping dependence on the emergency loans of its sponsors. For the State to pay its own way again would bring clear psychological and political benefits. It would not fix rampant unemployment or solve mortgage-loan defaults, but it might improve the conditions for tackling them. Speculation and drama It was a week of drama: fevered speculation in Dublin and beyond about the outlook for a major financial institution; hushed action in Government Buildings; uncertainty about the outcome; ambiguous signals from Europe; furtive whispers about a long night in Leinster House; bag-eyed TDs braying at each other at a midnight sitting of the D\x90il; ardent pleas for order from a put-upon Ceann Comhairle; and President Higgins s dead-of-night dash home from Rome to sign emergency legislation into law. Dublin s aim all along was to avoid making the EUR 3.1 billion payment due next month, which necessitated a long diplomatic campaign. Although the basic proposal to replace the notes with bonds and liquidate Anglo had been on the table since last autumn, there was no sign of a breakthrough as the new year opened. This a led a decision to step up the political offensive. After the ECB s governing council rejected one initiative, Dublin submitted a refined plan to the council this week. There were many tense moments as news of the liquidation plan leaked on Wednesday, prompting the Coalition to proceed with emergency legislation that night. A senior Government source says there were signs beforehand that the ECB s executive board was recommending that the governing council accept the plan, but its assent was never a given. When the decision was taken to go ahead with the legislation, there was no certainty of a successful outcome. Support finally came on Thursday, but it was very close-run. Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany s Bundesbank, pushed back strongly against agreement on Wednesday night, raising doubt about the entire plan. The fluid atmosphere was all very redolent of the 2008 banking guarantee, which drove the State into a fiscal wall of fire, and the 2010 EU-ECB-IMF bailout, which saw strangers step forward to pay Ireland s bills. These were defining events, seared in memory as moments of acute distress at which increasingly bad situations became inexorably worse. By contrast, the deal to scrap the dreaded promissory notes makes a bad situation better. It feels like progress. Is it a turning point? Perhaps. If Ireland s economic collapse came about in steady increments before the bubble finally burst, recovery is also an incremental slog. We are not in the realm of overnight changes in fortune. The crisis is far too deep for that. Yet this is still a decisive step forward on the long road to sustainable finances, and a battle won for the Government after many long months of resistance from an unyielding ECB. The deal is far from perfect. The Irish people are still on the hook for the rot in Anglo and in Irish Nationwide Building Society. That debt is EUR 31 billion, an appalling sum by any standard, and a drain on the national finances for generations to come. However, the arrangement made on Thursday peels back an excess burden built in by the promissory-note scheme. The interest fees on these IOUs were set to bring the total cost of the arrangement to EUR 47.4 billion. By spreading out repayments for up to 40 years and reducing the interest, the State s borrowing requirement should drop by EUR 20 billion over the next decade. Instead of paying down interest and principal while in the maw of recession, as foreseen under the promissory-note scheme, the issuance of long-dated government bonds postpones the first repayment of principal until 2038 and the last until 2053. There are three potential benefits. First, less money is drained out of the economy when the Government is still trying to engineer recovery and economic growth. The second is that this improves the chances of selling debt to private investors as Ireland pushes to exit the bailout. Third, the fact that the bonds won t be repaid for decades opens scope for economic growth and inflation to reduce their relative burden. All of that is benign, but there are still risks on the horizon, both abroad and at home. A consistent feature of the Irish debt saga is that it has been made appreciably worse at times by events elsewhere that were beyond Dublin s control. In the run-up to the bailout in 2010, the Deauville declaration by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the then French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, all but sealed Ireland s fate when they said private investors would have to bear costs in future bailouts. It was a political statement, now widely seen as a grave error, that cost Ireland dearly. In spite of relative calm in the euro zone since the ECB initiated a new bond-buying scheme last September, there is still uncertainty about the outlook for Spain and Italy. Any worsening of the general situation in the euro zone would hinder Ireland s prospect of exiting the bailout smoothly. Seeing Ireland through At the same time, there can be no doubt about Europe s determination to see Ireland through to the other side. There will be tough battles about the treatment or legacy of historic banking debts in surviving lenders such as Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. But the mood has changed fundamentally. More than ever, Ireland is seen as the best prospect of a successful bailout programme and as an exemplar of the merits of German fiscal rectitude. Two years ago, within hours of becoming Taoiseach, Kenny was at a European summit in Brussels. Immediately, he was ambushed by a forthright Sarkozy, who initiated a long campaign for Ireland to reform its corporate-tax regime as the price of bailout concessions. The Gallic spat , as Kenny memorably put it, underlined Ireland s low standing in the aftermath of the bailout. It mattered not a whit that Kenny had been on the Opposition benches throughout the boom years and that the economy blew up under the stewardship of Brian Cowen and Bertie Ahern. There would be no reduction in the interest rate on the rescue loans without a corresponding concession from Kenny on corporate tax, he was told. Not entirely without foundation, our economic disaster was seen in Europe as the failure of the entire body politic and the administrative class. It took the Taoiseach many months to win the argument. When the breakthrough came, it was as the result more of an effort to ease rising pressure on Italy and Spain than of Dublin s negotiating prowess. The picture has since changed, incrementally but steadily. At the outset there was anxiety among European politicians and officials about election slogans such as Labour s way or Frankfurt s way . They were also reluctant to countenance the notion that senior bank bondholders would be torched. Praise for the Government In the intervening period, the Government s solid execution of the bailout programme won international plaudits. These may grate, and much of the praise is superficial, but there was still a sense that Kenny, Gilmore and their Ministers were doing what they were supposed to do. This is important in a scenario where successive Greek governments have failed to meet promises, worsening recession in that country and increasing its reliance on external aid. Similarly, the political scene in Italy and the sense of brooding crisis in Spain underscore the external image of stability in Ireland. The referendum to cut judges pay is said to have impressed Merkel greatly. A bigger coup still was the referendum on the fiscal treaty. Voters might have come out more in fear than relish at the prospect of more Europe in Irish budgets, but it was still a result. All of this was for the good. While the Taoiseach always played on his centre-right political link with Merkel, the unseating of Sarkozy by the new socialist president of France, Fran\xABois Hollande, opened up a new alliance, and a connection for the T\x90naiste to exploit. Government priorities The key for the Government is to capitalise on the progress made. While the next big task in Europe is to secure a concession on legacy banking debts, a breakthrough is unlikely before the German general election in the autumn. In spite of this week s success, there is no let-up of other tension on the home front. Leaving aside the abortion conundrum, the economic pressures are still huge. The reforms mooted in talks on a second Croke Park pact are not exactly the stuff of popularity. While no Government wants garda\xA5 and nurses protesting on the streets, the ending of the promissory-note scheme will do little to lessen the demands to reduce the public-sector pay bill. At the same time, there is still frustration in the troika that the Government has not tackled pay at the very top of the scale in the health service and the Civil Service. The argument that the external supervisors would provide a degree of political cover for Ministers has not gained traction. The deal with Frankfurt comes as a great relief to Kenny, Gilmore and the rest of the Government, and reinforces their credibility and authority. But the road ahead is still long and hard.",1,regulation,,,,,EU
32,The Irish Times,02/10/2009,7 Reasons Why Ireland Will Be Left Behind,"IRELAND POST-RECESSION:As the first signs of economic recovery are seen in the US, Ireland faces a glut of problems that could see the country left behind while the rest of the developed world returns to fiscal prosperity  LAST JUNE when Ben Bernanke thought he spied some green shoots of recovery in the US economy, another American economist, Nouriel Roubini, referred to them as yellow weeds, while Warren Buffet claimed not to have seen anything, even though he had just had cataracts removed from his eyes. In recent weeks there is more reason for optimism in the US and most commentators would be of the view that the US economy may show some modest growth in 2010, though the unemployment rate might be slow to come down. Because America is a relatively closed economy the robust fiscal stimulus and quantitative easing were bound to pay dividends. American recessions usually don't last much longer than a year. Some recovery in the same timeframe is probably also on the cards for the euro area. So what does all this mean for Ireland? If the world economy is beginning to grow again, it might be expected that Ireland, because of its openness, would benefit quickly through stronger exports, foreign direct investment, increased tourism and so forth. There are signs the pace of decline in Ireland is moderating but we still don't know when the floor will be reached or how long the economy will remain on the floor. There are reasons to believe recovery in Ireland will take longer than in other developed economies and they are listed below. 1 Lack of competitiveness It is by no means certain we have restored competitiveness. Wages and other costs have been reduced in the recession, especially in the exposed sector, but this has also happened in other countries with which we trade. We may not have improved our competitiveness, relatively speaking, by very much, if at all. Maintaining our high minimum wage rate, while admirable in terms of equity, is not conducive to protecting market share. The lack of public-sector reform is also an adverse factor since it reduces overall productivity in the economy and adds to unit costs. Because of a legacy of uncompetitiveness, the rising tide of international trade may not lift our boat until all the bilge water has been pumped out. Resumption of inward flows of foreign direct investment may also be delayed for much the same reason. In addition, US multinationals may be reluctant to go against Barack Obama's stated desire not to ""ship American jobs overseas"". At present, there are affiliates of almost all of the important high-tech US multinational companies established in Ireland. This could imply a sort of natural limit to further investment from the US. We are powerless to influence the exchange rate at which we export and import. If the US dollar were to fall further in relation to the euro, we would suffer another loss of competitiveness. If China, for example, were to switch some of its savings from dollars to euros, this problem would be thrown into stark relief. Ireland should ask the IMF to revisit the 'substitution account', ie the creation of a new international currency in which countries like China could invest without causing exchange-rate volatility. 2 Dormant construction industry It is certain one sector of the economy will not make any contribution to growth for some years to come. Because of years of overbuilding, the construction sector will remain dormant for a long time. This is particularly troubling because it is a labour-intensive part of the economy. It also has a high multiplier effect on other sectors. 3 Uncertainty about taxes Nama and the process of fiscal adjustment have caused major uncertainties, especially in the minds of taxpayers. No one knows for sure how much additional taxes will be imposed as a result of bailing out the banks. The tax commission report also creates uncertainty. Even though it appears as if the government may long-finger some of the tax proposals, the public don't know this for certain. In these circumstances it is likely people will save as much as they can now to cope with future tax liabilities. Although consumer spending may not fall a great deal further, it is not likely to recover any time soon. The government is dealing with the various issues one by one and it does not see the interconnections, eg between Nama and consumer behaviour. This reflects the fact there is no overall economic plan. Another example is the effect of the property-tax proposal on Nama and indeed the entire budget. As long as the prospect of a property tax is hanging over people, the property market will remain moribund. It would be madness to trade-up in such a climate. Thus the recovery in property values needed to make Nama profitable and to safeguard taxpayers probably won't occur. This is another huge inconsistency that arises because there is no overall strategic plan. 4 Limited access to credit Because of sluggish consumption and a moribund property market, business investment will be slow to recover. Nama will have the effect of providing liquidity to the banks but there is no guarantee that this will increase the flow of credit for business investment. Traditionally, Irish banks have not lent much for investment in plant and equipment and it is most unlikely that they will start now. Nor do they have much understanding of the investment needs of high-tech sectors of the economy. To date the Irish banks have been investing their liquid surpluses in government paper. This is likely to continue. In other words they will get funds from the ECB (on foot of the Nama IOUs) and will invest them in Irish government bonds. This will of course help finance the government's fiscal deficit but it won't do much for the private productive sector. In essence the ECB will be financing the government's fiscal deficit. This would be illegal under EU rules if it were done directly. But if the funds are provided first to the Irish banks who then pass them on to the government, that is not illegal. A cynic might well argue that this will make it easy for the government to avoid important decisions like public sector reform, pay cuts, and so on. We can now, at last, understand the main reason why the government set its face against nationalising the banks. If they had done that the ECB funds could not end up in the government (NTMA) coffers. This is because the banks would be owned by the government and the ECB would not be permitted to lend to them. Nama, in other words, has all the hallmarks of a stroke. One wonders if the Greens are even aware of this. But strokes do not help the economy. The entire exercise can be seen as a weird form of 'crowding out' - sidelining the private sector in favour of government. It is likely the private business sector will remain short of credit, especially for medium- to long-term investment which is so crucial for continuing development. It is also likely that public investment in infrastructure will be cut. This kind of expenditure is easier to cut from a political point of view than social welfare spending or public servants' pay. But, unfortunately, it will reduce the productive capacity of the economy. 5 Unrest among the social partners The destructive bickering of the social partners as they seek to impress their respective constituencies, is a complete turn-off to potential investors. The social partners spent the last 15 years dividing up the national cake among themselves, but did nothing to enlarge it. The big decisions about social welfare, public sector reform and additional taxation have still to be taken and no constructive proposals are coming from the social partners. Instead there are warning shots and threats of civil unrest similar to those which bedevilled the country in the 1980s. 6 Hoarding labour Many companies are trying their best to avoid redundancies in the hope a recovery will begin sooner rather than later. But labour-hoarding cannot last indefinitely. The longer recovery is delayed, the greater the risk that many more workers will be let go. 7 Lack of confidence The confidence built up in the Celtic Tiger period has now been lost and the polls show there is little confidence in government to lead the way out of recession. The 'fire in the belly' which is required to get business investment going again is not in evidence. There are, of course, some positive factors such as the goal of becoming a smart economy, networking with the Irish diaspora and the developing stock of Irish entrepreneurs, especially in the field of technology. But these factors have a fairly long gestation period and, although they will benefit the economy in the long run, it is unlikely they will be significant in helping the economy recover over the next few years.",0,,,,,,
33,Irish Independent,22/05/2020,A 'cautious' reopening may hinder recovery - Goodbody; CORONAVIRUS ; Deficit may spiral - Donohoe,"GOVERNMENT plans to reopen the economy are more cautious in Ireland than time-tables that have been announced internationally which will slow economic recovery, Goodbody Stockbroker has warned. An analysis by the firm says while Government here was quick to introduce large-scale welfare and health supports, support for businesses is lower than elsewhere. This needs to be lifted quickly, it said, including with a large government-guaranteed loan scheme for firms. Goodbody's Activity in Ireland Dashboard (AID) is tracking data on traffic, financial payments, energy use, jobs and restaurant bookings to monitor the pace of exit from lockdown - and said there's little sign of activity levels returning to normal. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Reuters yesterday that the deficit this year - the gap between the State's spending and its income mostly from tax - could balloon to more than (EURO)30bn. The deficit that has already opened up is a result of Government having already committed to spend more than (EURO)13bn to cope with the health, social and economic costs of Covid-19 at the same time as tax income is falling dramatically. Goodbody is forecasting a budget deficit of 16pc of adjusted gross national income (GNI) and for the national debt to rise to 120pc of GNI, but warns that any predictions are highly uncertain in the current environment. Analysts thinks more assistance from Government for business sector will be necessary to avoid large-scale business failures, but at the same time, believe the reopening of the economy may be speeded up, which would lessen the economic hit. ""The success here to date in containing the spread of Covid-19 and Ireland's success in controlling the virus suggests that the reopening plan could be accelerated, thus limiting the longer-term economic damage to jobs and the public finances,"" it said. Goodbody expects the incoming government to implement a recovery plan focused on job-intense sectors, including construction. However, with around half of jobs here sustained by international demand, the pace of recovery will ultimately come down to economic recovery in the global market, the report said. At the same time, the detail of how the economy reopens will also dictate the pace of growth. ""Ireland's attractiveness as a destination for large ICT and healthcare firms puts it in a good position to gain from recovery,"" Goodbody's chief economist Dermot O'Leary said. ""However, while a simple narrative about the potential recovery is appealing, it ignores that different sectors of the economy will reopen at different speeds, and many businesses will not reopen at all."" In a potential repeat of the fallout from the last crisis, Goodbody expects housing supply to fall from current levels which are already well below what experts believe is required to accommodate the growing population. It is feared that builders may opt to sit on sites rather than push ahead with schemes in a market where house prices are expected to fall by up to 15pc.

34,The Irish Times,09/12/1993,"A Budget strategy of paying up earlySpending cutbacks and a surprise accounting manoeuvre will help Mr Ahern prepare the Budget,","THE Governments spending plans for next year have been drawn up after a particularly vigorous debate between the Minister for Finance, Mr Ahern, and Ministers from the spending Departments. The annual talks on the spending part of the Budget are known among civil servants as the ""Estimates campaign"", an appropriate name for a long drawn out series of battles between the penny pinchers in the Department of Finance and their more profligate colleagues in other Departments. Today the winners and losers will be clear when Mr Ahern publishes details of the Government's spending plans for next year effectively half of the 1994 Budget. Framing the Budget is never an easy task, but it has been clear for some time that 1994 would present particular problems. The Government cannot bank on rapid economic growth to boost tax revenues. On the spending side, the promises made in the Programme for Government have to be met, a substantial carryover increase in public pay is already agreed, and money has to be found for Aer Lingus. Add in the Government's commitment to keep Exchequer borrowing close to the Maastricht criteria of 3 per cent of national output and Mr Ahern's problems become obvious. 93120900093 In a recent analysis, which assumed that public sector workers would receive increases beyond those already promised, NCB stockbrokers calculated that Mr Ahern could be facing the need to borrow £1,200 million to bridge the gap between spending and revenue next year, compared with £766 million this year. No doubt similar sums were being done in the Department of Finance and action was taken to lower the borrowing outlook on a number of fronts. First Mr Ahern and his officials led in the Estimates campaign by Mr Bob Curran, second secretary in charge of spending went through a particularly thorough examination of each Department's spending. The extent to which they succeeded in finding cutbacks will be known today, but certainly some significant reductions are on the cards. The breakdown in the talks on the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP) also gave Mr Ahern the scope to rule that he would not give public servants any pay increase beyond those already promised as back money as a result of payments postponed from this year. But these postponed increases were already due to add a hefty 5.4 per cent to public pay spending next year. IN recent days another manoeuvre has been agreed which will reduce the public pay bill next year. In January, the Exchequer had been due to make a payment of about £75 million as back money to public sector workers, many of them in the health service. This money will now be dispensed at the end of December, so removing £75 million from the 1994 figures. It will also add £75 million to the 1993 spending figures so that, when calculations are made about the percentage increase in spending between this year and next, the switch will have a double benefit. A 5.4 per cent rise in public pay spending will fall to between 3.6 and 3.7 per cent. The movement of money into this year is possible because the Exchequer figures are close to target. Despite the expected payment of £75 million to Aer Lingus and some shortfall in VAT receipts, the target of £7 million appeared within reach. The latest decision to increase spending may push spending a little above the Budget target in cash terms perhaps by around £50 million but it should still come in on target as a percentage of Gross National Product (GNP), at 2.9 per cent. This is because the GNP figure is higher after recent revisions by the Central Statistics Office. Taking everything into consideration, the total rise in day today spending is not likely to be much above 3 per cent in tomorrow's figures only slightly above the expected rate of inflation. The most significant increase will be in the Department of Health where commitments towards the mentally and physically handicapped, the new Child Care Bill and the public dental services will increase spending. Budget day increases in social welfare payments will increase the rise in day to day spending beyond tomorrow's totals. WHILE the bulk of Government expenditure goes on day today current items like pay and services, the Exchequer also contributes significantly to the £1.9 billion annual public capital programme. A key factor here is receipts from the EU, where there has been uncertainty about what the Exchequer would receive next year under the new structural funds programme. The Government had hoped to get a large share of the EU money into next year's figures but this does not now appear to have happened. This will mean that some of the projects promised in the National Development Plan will start later than expected, with the emphasis given initially to those with the highest job content. The Exchequer will still have to maintain its capital spending at a high level to provide a contribution to the projects being financed from Brussels, but the expected increase in 1994 will now be less than anticipated. With the Estimates now decided, the Government is already turning its mind to the January Budget package, which will concentrate on the jobs issue.",0,,,,,,
35,The Irish Times,30/06/2020,A Cabinet of all the talents for all the country?,"Sir, - Congratulations to Taoiseach Micheál Martin and his Cabinet colleagues for taking the first steps, in their agreed ministerial appointments, away from the old-style localism and towards government primarily concerned with national policy-making.  The latter served the country well in giving citizens a sense of direct representation, but it is well past its sell-by date and has stultified the principal aim of government and the Oireachtas - to legislate.  This is evident in the poor legislative record of successive administrations and in the shameful sight of half-empty Dáil chambers on our television screens as what passed as national politics was so often reduced to local constituency lobbying. The new Government has shown courage in taking the inevitable flak from the ""neglected"" regions on the chin, and deserves the strong (and patient) support of our country for their Sisyphus-task ahead. - Yours, etc, EDA SAGARRA, Rathgar, Dublin 2. Sir, - In Mayo we were looking forward to a joyful release from the lockdown. Imagine our dismay, therefore, to discover lockdown has been replaced by being locked out of Cabinet roles. There will be trouble ahead. - Yours, etc,  GRAEME GUTHRIE,  Kilmeena,  Westport,  Co Mayo.  Sir, - For many years we have had a perfectly good system for selecting Ministers. Some were those who had done sterling work for the party, and others came from regions where we needed to bolster the party vote. Now we're told they're being chosen on something called ""merit"".  If we're not vigilant, this could spread to appointments to State boards as well. - Yours, etc, MICHAEL O'CONNELL, Cabinteely, Dublin 18. Sir, - Is this the best we can do? - Yours, etc, KEITH NOLAN, Caldragh, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim. Sir, - With the power balance shifting to Cork and no Cabinet Minister from the northwest or Connacht, should we wave goodbye to the A5 Western Transport Corridor, the Dublin to Derry expressway promised in the 2006 St Andrews Agreement? - Yours, etc, Dr JOHN DOHERTY, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall. Sir, - Do we now have a stereo government, Michael in one ear and Leo in the other? - Yours, etc, JOHN WILLIAMS, Clonmel, Co Tipperary. A chara, - It is most regrettable, in my view, that the province of Connaught was overlooked by the Taoiseach in the ministerial appointments. The west of Ireland will therefore have no proper voice at the Cabinet table. Its many urgent needs may therefore be overlooked again. It seems that a constitutional requirement is necessary to ensure that each part of our nation is properly represented in Dáil Éireann. - Is mise,  SEÁN Ó CUINN,  An Charraig Dhubh,  Co Átha Cliath.  Sir, - Contemplating the delay since polling day, one might despair of an electoral process that takes four months to yield a result. However, looking at the countries to our east and west leaves me relieved at the quality of our outcome. Worth waiting for. - Yours, etc, BRIAN O'BRIEN, Kinsale, Co Cork.  Sir, - Some 25 per cent of Green TDs now hold full ministerial position in Cabinet whereas the corresponding figures of 17 per cent and 16 per cent show the representation for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, respectively. If the ""super-juniors"" are counted, the figures become 33 per cent, 20 per cent and 18 per cent. Surely a good return for the Greens. - Yours, etc, SEAMUS BELLEW, Blackrock,  Dundalk, Co Louth.  Sir, - In view of the strength of representation which Cork now enjoys at the Cabinet table, I eagerly await the unveiling of secession talks. - Yours, etc, FIONNUALA WALSH, Galway. Sir, - Could this be the ""To Hell or to Connacht"" Cabinet? - Yours, etc, EOIN FAHERTY, Artane, Dublin 5.  Sir, - Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly made some very harsh comments about his predecessor. We can now look forward to him solving the problems in health - clearing all waiting lists, eliminating the trolleys, managing the pandemic.  No doubt he will do this while facing down the various vested interests.  All this will happen overnight, of course. - Yours, etc, MARGARET LEE, Newport, Co Tipperary. Sir, - At last we have a new Government.  Who will be the first in the media, as in the first annual report of the arrival of the cuckoo, to report the first crack in the Coalition?  For God's sake give them a reasonable honeymoon period. - Yours, etc, BRIAN GRAHAM,  Dublin 13.  Sir, - I am sure that the Minister for Heritage thought how lucky he was to be charged with the honour of protecting for future generations the built and natural heritage of Ireland that we have inherited from our ancestors.  What a privilege, a job you'd give your eye teeth for. Except for one little thing. What has Micheál Martin - a man we all know to be immensely proud of Ireland's natural beauty and immensely interested in our historical, archaeological, and architectural heritage - gone and done? He has told the Minister for Heritage that there's another little job he'd like him to do. He'd like him to build tens of thousands of houses and apartments, as many as possible, as cheaply as possibly, as quickly as possible, and for God's sake let nothing stand in the way, as this country has a housing crisis. Now, it should go without saying that there is no greater threat to our natural environment and to our archaeological and architectural inheritance - which the Minister for Heritage is charged with defending at all costs - than the construction industry of which the Minister for Housing must be champion. These two great offices are therefore mutually incompatible. It is, frankly, a grave error on An Taoiseach's part to ask one person to fulfil conscientiously both roles, even somebody of the talents of Darragh O'Brien TD. - Yours, etc, SEÁN DUFFY, FTCD Professor of Medieval Irish and Insular History. Trinity College Dublin,  Dublin 2.  Sir, - Once again I must complement Una Mullally on her unique ability to make words meaningful and, in many cases, insightful, but the logic of her article in Monday's Irish Times seems somewhat unworthy of her undoubted talent (""Why Martin as Taoiseach is wrong on a number of levels"", Opinion & Analysis, June 29th). The first sentence in her piece is baffling: ""Micheál Martin as Taoiseach makes little sense, and neither does this new Government.""  Fair enough, that's her opinion, but I doubt it is representative of a majority of public opinion. It would be both novel and refreshing if, at some future date, Una Mullally would positively identify who, in the absence of the two rotating taoisigh, would be most qualified to lead our country and its people through the maze of upcoming uncertainty and the likelihood of a Europe-wide economic depression. We are not currently blessed with a large pool of outstanding statesmen and women, and the Opposition, all of it, has rarely been as lacking in brain power. - Yours, etc, NIALL GINTY, Killester, Dublin 5. Sir, - It is sad to see the hullabaloo about the regional distribution of Ministers. It goes to show that parish-pump politics is alive and well. I, in my naivety, would have thought that Ministers are responsible for the whole nation and not simply their constituents.  I believe it is high time we consigned the parish pump to the scrapyard and had a national approach from all ministries. - Yours, etc, MATTHEW A HARMEY, Dublin 8.",1,political,,,,,ireland
36,The Irish Times,30/09/2003,A chance for the Opposition,"The Coalition Government is under severe and mounting pressure as a new Dail session opens at Leinster House today and offers the Opposition parties their first real opportunity in six years to present themselves as an alternative government. Fianna Fail is in particular disarray because of the disgraceful behaviour of a number of its backbenchers. But increasing public disillusionment with the quality of leadership offered by the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, could be of greater consequence. The Progressive Democrats have remained relatively unscathed but the growing economic and social difficulties facing the Government may change that situation. 03093000092 Three months ago, the Coalition Government sent the Dail into recess and hoped that a long, balmy summer and an upturn in the economy would encourage the electorate to forget, if not to forgive, the broken promises and the misjudgments it had made. It was expecting far too much. Last week's Irish Times/TNS mrbi opinion poll showed public support for Fianna Fail at a 20-year low. More than two-thirds of those surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the Coalition Government. And Mr Ahern's own satisfaction rating was shown to have dropped by 15 points within the past year. The Taoiseach made reference yesterday to some of the internal difficulties buffeting Fianna Fail when he told journalists that Mr G. V. Wright, the North Dublin TD involved in a drink driving accident, had telephoned him to apologise for his conduct. He would, Mr Ahern said, face the full rigours of the law. The same may hold true for Mr Michael Collins, the Limerick West TD who resigned the Fianna Fail whip last week after he was named as a tax defaulter. The Opposition parties will be anxious to establish why the Taoiseach took no action some months ago when he first became aware of Mr Collins's situation. No obvious mechanisms are available to revitalise the fortunes of the Government. International economic recovery is still an uncertain affair. In the meantime, difficult decisions have to be made in relation to Government spending, particularly in the areas of health and education. But the key to future prosperity and growth will depend on the amount of capital spending devoted to modernising our infrastructure and transport systems in the short term. Balancing those demands while, at the same time, coping with rising levels of unemployment will test this Government. The challenge to Fine Gael and the Labour Party is to provide a credible alternative to a Fianna Fail-led Government that appears to have run out of discipline and ideas. For the first time in six years, their combined strength in the polls is greater than Fianna Fail's. Rugged positions are being adopted, such as Mr Enda Kenny's insistence that benchmarking should not be paid in the absence of modernisation and increased productivity while Mr Pat Rabbitte has begun to broaden Labour's appeal to the consumer. Greater coherence and vigour will be required, however, if they are to convince the electorate.",0,,,,,,
37,The Irish Times,27/07/2009,A change in sentiment,"FOUR MONTHS ago the most pressing question in some quarters was whether Ireland could continue to borrow to finance a soaring budget deficit that was slipping further out of control. The answer was that it could do so with increased difficulty and at a higher financial cost. Foreign lenders sought ever-higher returns to compensate for the greater risks associated with a shrinking Irish economy which may contract by 2 per cent in the three years to 2010. In March, the yield difference or spread between Irish and German ten-year bonds had touched a record high. Ireland, as a sovereign borrower, was paying far more than Germany to issue government debt almost 3 percentage points more even though both countries share a common currency, the euro. That yield gap has since narrowed, and the differential is now closer to 2 percentage points. As Ireland s borrowing premium has declined, so too has the annual cost of servicing the national debt, which represents some welcome news for taxpayers. What is the reason for the sharp turnaround? Certainly, international investor sentiment towards Ireland has improved greatly in recent months, despite the loss of the country s triple-A credit rating in March. Michael Somers, chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), which borrows for the government and manages the national debt, has detected a noticeable shift in attitude by international investors, plainly impressed by the Government s plan to stabilise the public finances by 2013. In financial markets, however, sentiment is notoriously fickle. Fears of debt default, and suggestions that Ireland might be forced to seek sanctuary with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may well have seemed greatly exaggerated, given Ireland s low level of government debt. Nevertheless, at times of great financial and economic uncertainty, markets may be moved as much by sentiment as by more fundamental concerns. The success in changing a negative international perception of the Irish economy into a much more positive one, as measured by a reduction in borrowing costs, does represent a considerable achievement. It helps achieve stabilisation of the public finances, which is the foundation for economic recovery. The Government can take some credit for what Dr Somers has described as the huge change in general sentiment towards Ireland . Finance Minister Brian Lenihan impressed international investors needing further reassurance about Ireland s creditworthiness during his recent tour of major financial centres. That said, as Dr Somers has warned, international investor sentiment could also quickly change for the worse. A second rejection by voters of the Lisbon Treaty would prove greatly damaging in international markers. So too would any sign the Government lacks the political will to meet the tough budget targets required to stabilise the public finances. Much of the renewed confidence of international investors in the Irish economy is now based on the Government being able to keep its word, and deliver the tough medicine it has promised regardless of the political consequences.",0,,,,,,
38,The Irish Times,30/01/2006,A changing economy,"Like the boy who cried wolf, the frequency of the Central Bank's previous interventions is now acting to dull the edge of its latest warning about the state of the property market. Those interventions become less effective as they become more necessary. The reassurance and relief of last summer's slowing market have turned to uncertainty and concern. The OECD last year claimed house prices here are overvalued, a view from which the Central Bank did not demur when given the opportunity in a private meeting with OECD officials. House owners want prices to rise while prospective buyers want them to fall. But everyone's interests are served in a market in which they are stable. House price growth of low single digits would allow any overvaluation - if it exists - to unwind in a gradual manner. But a prolonged renewal of house price growth heightens the chance that any needed adjustment will be drastic, sudden and less easy to control. And the possibility is strong that this renewal of house price growth will continue. SSIAs will give their beneficiaries sufficient extra leverage to make demand grow by significantly more than it would under normal circumstances. By ignoring the pleadings of the IMF and Central Bank, the Government has chosen to inject further demand into the economy, increasing public spending growth to a double digit rate comparable to that witnessed in the last pre-election year of 2001. Partnership talks will begin a process leading to additional increases in demand pressure. This week the Government can make a significant contribution to stability in our housing market and economy. The Finance Bill could see the Government implement recent recommendations of the Pensions Board to incentivise SSIA holders to redirect their windfalls into PRSA accounts. A crossroads has been reached. The housing market is diverging, rather than converging towards a soft landing. Demand in the economy is accelerating. And Ireland's productivity and external competitiveness are declining, not improving. Such circumstances will cause any responsible policy maker to stop and think. Mistakes made now - whether in relation to the housing market or pensions policy - will not be forgotten in years to come. As Germany begins to share the recovery seen across the euro zone, the ECB is losing its inhibitions about raising interest rates. The ECB will increase interest rates by three quarters of a per cent this year, it is predicted. This will have a needed cooling effect on our housing market. In spite of so much economic growth and development, we still need Europe to save us from ourselves.",1,monetary,,,,,ireland
39,The Irish Times,10/10/2020,A delicate balancing act; Budget 2021,"The Government has scope in the budget next Tuesday to keep supporting the economy through the pandemic emergency. The cash is not limitless, of course, but pre-budget figures show that there is room for manoeuvre, albeit involving continuing to borrow very large amounts of money. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minster for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath announced yesterday that before any budget measures, the gap between spending and revenue next year would be about EUR 14.5 billion. With a deficit this year of just over EUR 21 billion - assuming no further public health restrictions - it is possible to allocate extra cash in the budget, while still setting a target for borrowing next year which is below this year's level.  This needs to be put in context, of course - borrowing will still likely be 5 to 6 per cent of GDP next year.  This all assumes that the virus emergency does not deteriorate significantly. The Ministers announced that a scenario for 2022 based on a more severe outcome would also be published, alongside the core forecasts in the budget. This makes sense and will likely underline the severe budget consequences of wider restrictions. McGrath pointed out that the cost of wage and income supports in the early days of the crisis ran to around EUR 200 million each week, so budget figures could quickly be under pressure if there were a prolonged shutdown.  The precise way the cash will be allocated is not clear, but the outlines are generally coming into view. There will be an additional boost to capital spending, above the EUR 1 billion further increase already allocated. A sizeable amount of money will be set aside to deal with the fall-out from Covid-19 - above and beyond the EUR 8.5 billion which will be the carry-over cost of this year's measures in that area. Much of this will be in a new recovery fund, some of which will be allocated to specific purposes and some left to be dispersed depending on how the virus - and the Brexit story - plays out.  Budgeting against such uncertainty is very difficult - indeed it will be impossible to be precise. So it makes sense to set the targets on the basis of a conservative viewpoint - on both the pandemic and Brexit - as the Government will try to do. There is a strong case to continue high levels of spending on business and income supports. And 2021 is not the year to be increasing the general level of taxation, even if some revenue-raising measures will be considered.  The two ministers face a delicate balancing act. Above all, they do not want to see their forecasts going way off track next year. There is inevitable risk in what lies ahead for the public finances. But for now there is really no choice but to keep supporting the economy, business, jobs and incomes insofar as possible.",1,fiscal,covid,,,,ireland
40,The Irish Times,23/11/2017,A deteriorating outlook; British budget,"There is one key message from the British budget: economic growth there is poor and the economy is set to under-perform. The GDP growth forecast this year was cut from 2 per cent to 1.5 per cent and is predicted to slow further in the years ahead. With the possibility of an even greater hit to the economy if there is a hard Brexit, the outlook for the UK is uncertain as well as poor. No amount of rhetoric from chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond could conceal this. Politically, he may have done enough to keep the show on the road, for the moment at least. Divisions in the cabinet meant he could never hope to keep everyone happy but, by avoiding undue references to Brexit or the government's plans for it, he ensured much of the immediate debate will relate to issues such as housing. That said, focus in London will soon turn back to the negotiations with the EU and the December deadline for a decision on whether the Brexit talks can progress to the next stage. In that sense, the budget was something of a diversion. Slower growth takes a toll. An earlier promise to eliminate borrowing has been quietly dropped and the deficit will now be higher than expected. There was limited cash to spare for social services, leaving the Conservatives open to attack from Labour.  A key focus was housing, with significant resources planned for building and land provision to tackle a crisis of affordability and supply which has some similarities with our own. It remains to be seen how effective this will be, while the surprise measure of a stamp duty break for first-time buyers was immediately criticised as being likely to push up prices. Like their counterparts in Ireland, Britain's politicians are learning that tackling housing is a lengthy and complex challenge. Attention will now turn to the key talks on Brexit. Whether prime minister Theresa May can do enough to make sure these progress to the next stage remains very much open to question. If she does not, then the uncertainties created will only damage the economic outlook further.",1,geopolitics,brexit,,,,uk
41,The Irish Times,18/10/2012,A disenchanted electorate,"PUBLIC SUPPORT for the Government and its leaders continues to decline, according to the latest Irish Times/IpsosMRBI opinion poll, as the economy remains in the doldrums, austerity measures are implemented and pre-election commitments made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party remain unfulfilled. The Government s satisfaction rating has fallen by 40 per cent within the past year as unemployment edged upwards, mortgage difficulties increased and Ministers attempted to curb spending and raise new taxes. Speculation on the taxes/cuts mix for the forthcoming budget has done little to comfort a voting public growing tired of relentless austerity and lingering uncertainty. As the Government prepares for that extremely difficult December budget, the message from the electorate is one of growing disenchantment, particularly among low-income families. Support remains strongest, at 31 per cent, among professional and business people and farmers. But, for a majority of voters, a belief in economic revival and political competence has worn thin where Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore are concerned. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin will greet the results of this poll with relief. Following a year in which the party trailed Sinn Féin in the opinion polls, support has risen by six points since May. Fianna Fáil has now moved into second place, at 21 per cent, behind Fine Gael. The lead over Sinn Féin is statistically insignificant at 1 per cent but, in psychological terms, it may provide the tonic necessary to reinvigorate the organisation. Support for Fine Gael has continued its incremental decline, at 31 per cent, while the Labour Party has shown some slight resilience and regained two points to 12 per cent, well short of its election performance. All the party leaders, with the exception of Eamon Ryan of the Green Party, experienced a decline in personal satisfaction ratings. This was most pronounced in the case of Gerry Adams who dropped eight points to 29 per cent. Despite that, Mr Adams attracts the second highest satisfaction rating, behind Mr Kenny at 33 per cent. The findings of this poll will make for uncomfortable reading at Cabinet. Many of the seats won by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the general election could be swept away if a fresh contest took place. At the same time, their overwhelming Dáil majority has the capacity to weaken Coalition discipline and encourage worried backbenchers to adopt confrontational positions. Friction on issues such as the Croke Park deal, healthcare, taxation and welfare payments has already surfaced and is likely to increase in coming months. The message for the Government is clear: the electorate is seeking dramatic action and outcomes, not piecemeal change. Unemployment remains the single greatest challenge. This threat to social stability must be tackled with increased resources and greater urgency. Banks should be directed to lend to small businesses and address mortgage problems, through legislation if necessary. Time is not on the Government s side. Long-term unemployment fosters social disintegration. Job creation and economic reform are not optional extras.",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
42,Irish Independent,03/03/2016,A draw can be a good result in football but it just doesn't work in politics,"THE political system is heading into a period of uncertainty that may last a year or more. Uncertainty is bad for business, investment and the economy, but just how bad? Ultimately, who pays the price of instability? The outcome of the general election was more akin to a draw than anything else. Fine Gael essentially blew it but still remains the largest party. Fianna Fáil surprised everybody with the extent of its gains and has the valuable away goal, but it can't lead a straightforward majority government. Talk of a grand Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil coalition is already dissolving even though it is the only combination that will give a clear strong majority. Instead, the political narrative is being set by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin who is talking about reforming the processes of the Dáil. At the very least the country is heading into some unknown territory. That unknown may only last until next year when another election might have to be called. Either way the short-term road ahead looks pretty unclear. The economic price for that uncertainty might not be paid in the way everyone expects. There was an automatic assumption that an uncertain outcome would affect Ireland's cost of borrowing on international markets. It didn't happen. On Monday morning Ireland's ten-year bond yields ticked up by a tiny nine hundredths of a per cent to 0.9pc, before falling again as the market expects more Eurozone quantitative easing. The international sovereign debt market is no longer a real market. The idea that a country like Ireland can borrow ten-year money at 0.9pc when our debt to GDP is running just below 100pc is simply not real. In Spain, where they haven't managed to pull a government together since December, bond yields have gone up but are still at just 1.7pc on ten-year money. The cost of raising debt has more to do with Mario Draghi than Enda Kenny, Micheál Martin and who the Healy-Raes might support as Taoiseach. Rather than be complacent about the impact of instability on our cost of raising debt, we should be deeply concerned at how those artificially low rates are unsustainable regardless of whether we have a government or not. We are lucky that this year only around (EURO)8bn of our existing debt has to be refinanced. The NTMA has already raised around (EURO)4bn of its targeted (EURO)6bn to (EURO)10bn for this year. But some really big years lie ahead for whatever new government emerges. Between now and 2020 about (EURO)66bn of our national debt matures. The NTMA has to raise this amount in fresh borrowings at whatever the market rate will be, plus whatever additional new borrowing is required. The stakes are very high. If our cost of ten-year debt went up let's say to 3pc - still a historically reasonable level - we would end up shelling out (EURO)1.3bn per year more in interest payments on it, than if we were to raise it at current rates. That would certainly shrink the socalled fiscal space. Another flash point for a political fudge of some kind would be the Budget. It is very hard to see how anything other than a strong government with a solid majority would get a budget passed. A weak government could get the wrong budget passed - namely something for everyone - that would cost a fortune. How would the dynamic between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure work? Public expenditure needs to be disciplined but equally, there is a genuine and serious need to spend money in the right way. The next administration will come under enormous pressure from within the public service for pay increases. It had already started with nurses and other groups. They are queuing up to demand improvements in their position. The more the new government brags about how well we are doing, the greater the pay claims. Some claims are probably badly needed, while others are not. Strong government involves making distinctions about the allocation of resources without an eye towards votes in the short term. Just this week the European Commission published a scathing report on the inadequacies of spending in education, health and the rising inequality that occurred during the last administration. How can those issues be tackled through greater spending while taking more low paid out of the tax net and trimming back on the USC? Unless the economy keeps growing, the maths starts to look like the loaves and fishes. The answer is that the new government should engage in better spending and not just more sending on public services. Different parties will have contradictory views in Leinster House about who is most deserving. But the new government will be very conscious of the mistakes made by Fine Gael and Labour on these issues in the last government, which were ruthlessly punished by the electorate. A government, other than a Fine Gael/ Fianna Fáil coalition is more likely to postpone tough decisions and kick for touch until the next election, rather than use up political capital on unpopular decisions that won't go through. The last government did well in some things but fell hopelessly short in others. Promises were made about culling the prices the state pays to drug companies for medicines. State procurement reform was supposed to deliver billions in savings. The last government selected certain multi-billion euro transport and infrastructure projects over others without publishing a shred of evidence or cost/benefit analysis on which would be most beneficial. These are all issues where the last coalition could have done better. But it is hard to see much political consensus in some kind of temporary minority government set-up on how to spend the limited fruits of a limited recovery. The first challenge for any new government will be to inject a sense of realism into the economic discussion on how much money there really is to spend. Politicians behave differently when there is an election coming. They often make their biggest mistakes in the run-up to it. We could have a full year with the possibility of another election dictating policy decisions or ensuring certain decisions are simply not made. A draw can sometimes be a good results in football, but it doesn't work in politics. The idea that a country like Ireland can borrow ten-year money at 0.9pc when our debt to GDP is running just below 100pc is simply not real",1,political,,,,,ireland
43,The Irish Times,23/11/1992,"A fair deal for all sectors and a share of economic growth is the aimIn an interview with Denis Coghlan, Political Correspondent, the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, talks of his vision of the Ireland of the future","Political Correspondent Q:Taoiseach, what kind of country would you like to preside over? A:There are things I would like to do and changes I would like to make in this country. I certainly believe in open Government. I came in with that view in mind; that everybody out there should feel part of what is going on in this country, feel part of what the Government is doing and feel that there is a fair and equitable deal for everybody. That economic growth should be shared, not just between regions but between the various sectors of Irish society. That everybody would feel that they were getting a fair deal from the government. That is the type of Government I want to run in this country. That is the kind of Government I set out to run in this country and that is the kind of Government I am going to run after the election is over. Q:What other country would most nearly approximate your vision? A:Countries like Austria and Denmark which have chosen a certain path of development, but I am not saying that.I would like to see Irish society develop in the same direction. I think from a developmental point of view, Austria and Denmark are two models we could follow. Certain elements of Japan, in terms of how they picked themselves up after the war and transferred themselves over from agricultural-based regions to industrial-based regions … From an Irish society .point of view, I want to. build a happy Irish society in-which everybody feels they are getting a fair deal. I think that's what people want. They want to feel they are getting a fair deal and a fair shake from Government. I want to make Shannon a bridgehead from traffic right into Europe; make it a hub for distribution both for air and for sea going traffic. And then we build around that a new industrial infrastructure in that region to link the Americas with Europe and to make Ireland the bridgehead in that link from west to east. I have taken a certain steps along those lines in relation to that region as a sort of pilot region. I have had long discussions with the EC about it and I think that, at the moment, we are doing a study in conjunction with the EC to set up in Shannon a depot or a bridgehead for new technological developments which are taking place around the world. In other words hydrogen energy. There is a link between Quebec and Hamburg and we want to make the same link between Brazil and Europe through Shannon Cheap energy down there and cheap raw materials coming in in bulk can indeed provide the basis for new industrial development infrastructure in that region. Industrial policy in this country has for too long remained too over-dependent on major international investment coming in. We don't have basic industries, like Japan had to do after the war; that Germany had to do after the war; we don't have any raw material base metals that builds up such an infrastructure, but neither had Japan. They got them elsewhere. They got them at a price. They got them in and they built an industrial base from that. That is the type of industrial base I want to see in this country. I also want to see an energy policy that complements the development of the industrial infrastructure in this country because I think we have an energy policy which is going in the wrong direction. I want to see a cheap energy policy, to make a real impact on the unemployment situation. On the unemployment situation itself, I recognise that there is no quick fix. I recognise that we have to do long- term planning and long-term regional development. In the meantime, the Government is already in discussions with Brussels about finding ways to put people to work in community development. The Oireachtas Committee on Unemployment has identified the capacity that exists between all the corporations and local authorities throughout the country, that they could use 40,000 people and take them on on that basis. We have done our analysis of that. £4,000 a year is being paid out on average to a social welfare recipient and if we get £3,000 extra a year from the structural funds we could employ those people. I've always believed that to maintain rural Ireland and to maintain a strong rural society in this country, which is the bulwark of Irish society, that we need to have supplementary employment on the ground or additional activity - small industry would be the ideal mix for part-time employment, or full-time employment - to sustain people in rural Ireland. There has been far too much of a drift from the west coast and the midlands to the east coast and we can try to push that back through decentralisation, through rural development and through all the various mechanisms and structures that we can create to keep a balanced society in Ireland. Q:Can Fianna Fail create your ideal society alone? Or would it be possible to do it in a coalition with another party? A: Our experiences through the PESP have shown us that we can bring all strands of Irish society with us and I believe that partnership has been very successful and has played a vital role in taking the country from where it was in 1987 to where it is today. Fianna Fail have shown in the past that they have worked very well with that partnership and I don't see there are any other parties in this election which are showing any willingness to work that partnership which is vital to the success and development of this country Q:Would Fianna Fail join with another political party after the election to continue that work? A:I am not going to count the votes before they are cast and I don't think anyone else should either. I think there are still a lot of people with their minds not made up in relation to it. And I think that, at the end of the day, they will be slow to buy uncertainty and instability with a mixture of parties. Q:What particular aspects of Irish society do you wish to retain? A:There is a lot of good in Irish society, but there are changes taking place. We have to take a combination of the best of our traditional values with us and manage the changes that are taking place, and mould that society into a cohesive unit. I don't want to see this society divided between rural and urban and I would strongly oppose that, I don't want to see it divided either between rural and urban or the haves and the have-nots. I think if you don't have a society that thinks they are getting a fair deal, first of all from the Government, and secondly from those who are paying the money into the Government - if they feel they aren't getting value for money - I think those are the two areas you have to watch very closely in moulding society to take on the best of our traditional values. Managing change is never easy. Managing change will meet with opposition. It always has done but I think there is an onus on government to mould the two together. Q:What should be the place of the Catholic Church in the State ? Would you like to see changes in the relationship between that church and the State? A:We are a strongly Catholic State and we have always recognised the right of the church to speak out on issues of morals. Some commentators saw last summer as a watershed between Government and the church in relation to the Maastricht Treaty but the people decided. I think that the church has its place in Irish society and the Government has a different role to play. Q:In this campaign, unemployment has been identified as the main issue. How many jobs will Fianna Fail's new programme generate? A:I think the days of putting figures on thousands and thousands of jobs are things that the electorate just turns away from. What they want to see is a set of coherent policies which will attack the jobs crisis out there. Fianna Fail have put forward policies in that regard; have put forward an investment-led industrial development policy because it is the only sensible way for the government to go when the world is still in recession. Now that the GATT Agreement appears to be coming into play, I think it will give a new boost to international trade and consequently our export industries - when markets open up abroad - will be able to expand and create jobs. We are bringing forward projects that would be done in time if money was available. Now that the cohesion funds are becoming available in 1993 we can start a lot of those projects and have jobs created today by putting State assets to work that are lying idle at the moment. I think that is the most sensible way to go. We also have the local enterprise boards and initiatives oh tourism and other small projects. It's a combination of factors that's going to attack the jobs crisis. Q:Health and social welfare are prime concerns for the 30 per cent of the population below the poverty level. What message have you for them? A:I think it's not generally known that we are now spending £500 million more on health than we were in 1987, which is a huge amount of money and it has to come from somewhere. The Government can only get revenue from two places, either from income tax or from borrowing. It's growth that has produced this additional money for health. It's adjustments in the tax structures as well that has produced this money for health and social welfare. On the health side, I don't believe we are getting value for money from a management point of view. I want to see complete new management structures, cost-effective management structures, in the whole hospitals administration area. (think too much is going on administration and too little on patients; that there is better value for money to be got there. Social welfare has always been a strong policy issue with Fianna Fail governments. We have always looked after those who were less well able to look after themselves. It is part of our caring philosophy. An old age couple now living in Ireland are getting £30 a week more than a similar couple in Britain. That is a big differential and an unemployed person here is getting £17 more. That gives you an idea of how far our development has come along. It's not to say that there isn't room for improvement. But there are too many people in the system who are cheating the system and we make no apologies for going after them and we will take them out of the system. Because we want more money for those who need more and less for those who are cheating the system. But at the end of the day we have to produce more wealth to be able to develop help for those who want it. I am a caring person. I know exactly what the problems are; the household problems; the budgetary problems and as Minister for Finance I tried to take the low-paid out of the tax net and tried to give families more support to rear their children in difficult times. Q:What do you and Fianna Fail offer to the disillusioned youth of the country? A:I have spoken to the youth. I have been a regular visitor to university campuses and the youth quite clearly know that there is a bad world recession and that we can only maximise the capacity of the Irish economy to create jobs. We have identified the sectors. We have set up the Financial Services Centre. We have taken the initiative in tourism to double our targets and to create 25,000 jobs and we nearly achieved that. We have to develop a new tourism product, with a new Minister for Tourism, because it is labour intensive. Forestry is the same and so is fishing where Michael Woods has done quite a considerable amount of work in a short time. The young people know that there is no quick fix, that what's happening in the world must affect us and when that's gone by, then there will be a lot more job opportunities. But the youth today are anxious to get out into the world and get experience and get skills additional to what they have got in education here and then be able to come back, hopefully, someday, in a few years' time when the economy has lifted and there are more opportunities available. That is the kind of conversation I have had with graduates, either in regional colleges or in universities and I am a regular visitor to them. They know that the Government, of itself, cannot produce the jobs. They know what the facts of life are in relation to economic growth and economic development. They are anxious to get involved and that is why I want to put a structure in place on the ground which will look alter people with new ideas, young people or people who have lost their jobs, to give them the chance and the opportunity to develop because I think that the small person of today can be the big person of tomorrow. Q:How do you account for the party's low level of support in the campaign to date? A: There is a volatility that 1 haven't seen in elections for a long time. Some people are making the mistake that it is the same 40-42 per cent that's there all the time. It's not. It's a shifting 42 per cent because it shifts from region to region. Our own tracking polls put us at over the 42 and heading towards 43. Other polls are changing all the time, so the only poll that will be valid with all those people still making up their minds over whether they want stability and certainty or instability and uncertainty - will be the result of the election, and I am not going to anticipate it. Q:Do you accept that your evidence at the beef tribunal, the fall of the Government and the recriminations between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats, were the major factors behind the drop in the satisfaction ratings? A: I think that, initially, most people out there blamed the Government for the election. They felt we planned the election and that it was a coordinated plan, a strategy set out, which was not the case. I certainly did not want an election, did not plan an election and Fianna Fail didn't want it and wasn't prepared for it. As the campaign wore on that anger has dissipated and in the last four days people are beginning to look at the issues of the election. No Government in their sane senses would have an election a few weeks before Christmas. But it took a while to get that message through and I think the tide is turning, just at the right time. Q:A former Minister has accused you of ""whinging"" and said you just ""weren't up to the job"". What effect are these divisions within Fianna Fail having on the campaign? A:There are people who feel aggrieved about not being part of the Fianna Fail team in Government. That is a natural reaction. We will always have to live with that, irrespective of who is in government as Taoiseach. You have it in every party, just as you have it in Fianna Fail. Q:Taoiseach, do you really believe that an attempt has been made to ""demonise"" you in this election? If so, what form has that campaign taken? A:I will leave that to the people of this country to judge for themselves and I won't comment any more. Q:When you took office, you promised open government and greater accountability., Now a Supreme Court decision imposes strict confidentiality on Cabinet discussions and the decision-making process. Do you regret this development? A:Some people thought that was my decision and it was running contrary to my views on open government. I think I have been one of the most open Taoisigh who ever led this country. I have an open discussion with the press every week and I don't put any strictures on the questions you can ask and I will continue to do that. I have always believed in giving the maximum amount of information to the Dail and I encourage my Ministers to do it. The Supreme Court decision was sought by the Attorney General in his independent role as protector of the Irish Constitution. And, mind you, when you look at the commonsense approach to this, if we had a situation in this country where every Minister could walk out of the Cabinet room and say: 'Look, I don't agree with that decision and don't approve of it,' we would end up with no government because you would get no decisions taken if people did not have the protection of secrecy in government to allow open and free discussion. People would be running for cover on every difficult decision taken. So there is a lot of common sense to it. And to portray it as bad accountability or otherwise … Government Departments are accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General for the spending of public money and the Government themselves are accountable to the Irish electorate who are the bosses and employers at the end of the day … You can't go the distance that some people would wish for by having television cameras at Cabinet meetings. It just would not work. Q:Unlike former Taoisigh, you have publicly declared, and backed it up by action, that you will sue newspapers, radio and television for possible libels. Do you feel, in retrospect, that this was inconsistent with your intention, on arrival in office, to open windows and let in the light? A:I don't think it is. I have run a newspaper myself. I have owned a newspaper. I paid out libel claims myself in relation to it. And I feel that if somebody wrongs somebody they are entitled to retribution. All I have said to the press is: ""Don't tell me lies and don't tell lies about me"". You can criticise me all you like on policy and everything like that, but don't impugn my Integrity because I hold that very dearly. My word is my bond in business and in politics and I don't want anyone to try and take that away from me. Criticise me all you like on policy. You will never hear a word back from me and 1 have never held that against anybody. But I think I am entitled to protect my integrity and credibility where it is called into question on a personal basis, not on a political basis. Q:Do you still feel confident about movement to Economic and Monetary Union and the beneficial results here? A:Very much so. And I think the turbulence in the international currency markets shows that if we had a single currency we wouldn't have that kind of situation to contend with in future. EMU is pushing ahead. I had a meeting with Chancellor Kohl 10 days ago and he firmly intends that we will get a fully successful summit in Edinburgh. The German Government is fully committed to supporting the financial integration of Europe, contrary to views that have been expressed recently because of the cost of German unification. The view now beginning to emerge is that we should have structural funds for a seven-year period, not a five-year period. I told Chancellor Kohl that I was quite prepared to go along with that on the basis that there was an increase in funds to compensate for the additional period. And new proposals from President Delors appear to indicate that they are prepared to look at increased cohesion funds and stretch the funds for the remainder of the period, which would be good because we would have certainty in planning for the next seven years. There will be even more funds available, even more than I said myself, and I think that will give us the opportunity to do the things in this country which we would not be able to afford to do if we did not have those funds. Q:Do you believe the powers of the European Parliament should be strengthened at the expense of the Council of Ministers, and would this affect Ireland because of the small number of MEPs? A: I think that our best protection is within the Council of Ministers, where a Minister is accountable to his own government and where the government is accountable to the people.. I believe in more powers for the European Parliament but on the powers of representation, I think we would lose out as a small nation if we were to take all powers from the Council of Ministers and give them to the Parliament because of the strength there of the larger nations. Q:Do you support the view of former Taoisigh that Ireland should not use neutrality to block the road to EC political .union, should it require a common defence arrangement? A:The question of political union doesn't arise until 1996. Other Taoisigh have made the point that if we have to look at that situation, post 1996, then I am in line with that sentiment. But, at the end of the day, no change will be made without coming back to the Irish people in a referendum if any changes are proposed after 1996. Q:How do you react to unionist criticism that you were inflexible in negotiations on Articles 2 and 3 and inhibited the Northern talks? A:I have approached the Northern talks in an honourable fashion. (think the British Government, through Sir Patrick Mayhew and even Mr John Major himself, have recognised the tremendous commitment we have made in putting senior Ministers up there all the time to participate in those talks. Three days a week was a huge commitment to make. We produced papers that would belie the kind of criticisms which are coming out. We have approached these talks to try and find a new path to peace; to try and find a way to build institutions that both communities could look towards and get involved with, while at the same time recognising the diversity and the differences between the two traditions in the North of Ireland. That is the only sensible way forward. If you take one side of the problem up there and try to solve it at the expense of the other it just won't work. It will probably exacerbate the situation. So I am approaching the problem on an evenhanded basis. They wont find me inflexible. We know it is a complex area. We know we have to move slowly. We have made more progress than people believe and I would like to think in terms of getting back to finish the job because I am passionately committed to finding peace in the North of Ireland. I believe we have made a lot of progress. I believe there is the potential there for progress and I would like to be able to say more - out in the open - that I cannot say here today. But it will be seen in time, I hope, to have borne the fruit people have looked forward to for the past 25 years.",0,,,,,,
44,The Irish Times,27/02/2009,A Fine Gael tough budget would restore confidence,"OPINION:We need a new top tax rate, the metro must wait and Dáil costs have to be cut right now, writes ENDA KENNY. THE ACCELERATING pace of job destruction, the loss of confidence in our banks and the spiralling Government deficit are inextricably linked. The Government has failed to stop the haemorrhage of jobs in large part because it has failed to restore access to credit for businesses by fixing the banking crisis. And it failed to fix the banking crisis because the markets are losing faith in the Government s guarantee to our banks. The international markets are losing faith in the guarantee because the Government has failed to stop the public finances from spiralling out of control at a pace that has not been seen in any other country in the world. And it has failed to stop the public finances from spiralling out of control because the measures it has taken so far have been limited, partial, selective and unfair. There are many things that need to be done to improve the situation of our struggling small businesses, exporters and job seekers. But nothing will have much impact unless we take the hard decisions now to mend our broken public finances. That is why I believe it is long past time for the Government to end the current state of denial and prevarication. Its strategy for the public finances and wider economy is clearly failing, and both the Irish public and international markets funding the banking system and our Government are losing patience. We no longer have the luxury of the time needed for long consultation processes by Government advisory groups before taking further decisions on public spending, reform and taxation in 2010. It is better that we take decisions for ourselves now, than force outsiders to do it for us later this year. Ultimately, this is about our financial independence. That is why I am now calling on Government to announce that it will, within the next month, deliver a new budget that substantially cuts the EUR 40 billion Government borrowing requirement for 2009 and 2010 combined that is being forecast by most independent economists. If Fine Gael were in government in the morning and I were taoiseach, that is what I would be doing. To achieve this, the new budget must be ambitious, wide-ranging and comprehensive in its scope. It has to be fair and proportionate in its execution by showing what role is being played by all groups in society, particularly those who are in the best position to contribute more. It has to look not just at spending cuts but at additional tax and other revenue-raising measures that can drag our public finances back under control. Fine Gael will enter this debate constructively. I have asked Richard Bruton to prepare our own strategy in this regard. Nothing is off the table on our part. We will look at ways of increasing taxes and broadening the tax base into new areas that do not fundamentally damage our competitiveness and economic model. We must also look to ensure that the valuable role played by so many of our voluntary groups is protected and recognised. Our approach will be driven by the principle of those that have most should contribute most. Fine Gael will look at options, such as increasing the top rate of income tax, look at the scope for a new top rate of tax for those on very high incomes and finally, we will look at the introduction of a carbon levy at, say, EUR 25 per tonne of carbon. These are the types of measures on the tax side that we believe now need to be considered. Also on the tax side, we should be looking at abolishing stamp duty and replacing it with capital gains tax on sales of houses of the super-rich . We will look at which infrastructure projects can be safely deferred or abandoned. That means that some projects, like the metro projects in Dublin, would be put on the back-burner. We would scrap the old National Development Plan and reprioritise smaller, labour-intensive projects that can keep as many tradesmen and builders employed as possible. Fine Gael would push ahead with its proposals to control public sector pay, such as the pay, increments and bonuses freeze for two years, a targeted programme of back-office staff redundancies and pay cuts for those on higher incomes. We originally said that the pay cuts should only affect those earning more than EUR 100,000 but, given the current state of the public finances, that threshold should now be lowered. Most of all, we will look at radical reforms to our budgetary system that squeezes out waste and poor value for money. That means tackling the big bureaucracies like the Health Service Executive and Fás and driving substantial savings in their bloated back-office structures. It also means at a Governmental level cutting the number of junior Ministers, cutting the Dáil committees by 10 and reducing the numbers of staff that prop up Ministers press and constituency operations. Not everything can be delivered in one go. But we will leave no doubt as to what we intend to achieve in Government and how. I encourage other parties to do the same. Some will say that further spending cuts and tax increases will only further damage the economy at this delicate time. I was also once of this view, but now believe that the opposite is the case. Families and businesses already know there is serious pain ahead. But what is holding them back from getting on with their lives and business decisions is the uncertainty about what form this pain will take, and how long it will last. This has to be faced up to with a sense of realism. Many of the fundamental strengths of the Irish economy remain in place high levels of education, a flexible and skilled workforce and a pro-enterprise tax and regulatory environment. But what is killing the economy, and by extension our society, is the fear and uncertainty stemming from the obvious lack of a credible and widely supported plan to deal with our broken public finances and banking system. If we don t tackle this problem, we won t get our people back to work. I believe that if the Irish public and the international markets see a Government with a plan, one that is ambitious, specific, fair, all-inclusive and widely supported and one that does not defer difficult decisions on tax and public sector reforms to future years, then confidence can be restored. Funds could once again flow through our banks to small businesses, homeowners would finally get some respite and the draining of jobs and hope from our economy would start to be reversed.

45,The Irish Times,14/10/2011,A fiscal call to arms,"THE REAL function of a fiscal council is to speak truth to power, to remind governments of harsh economic facts they may not want to hear, when they least want to hear them at budget and election time. How will the Coalition Government respond in deed to the bold advice given by the newly established Irish Fiscal Advisory Council? Minister for Finance Michael Noonan seems ready to listen. The council in its first report recommends that the Government should accelerate the pace of fiscal adjustment and make greater savings than the EUR 3.6 billion planned in next year s budget. The Government should also aim, the council says, to cut the general government deficit to 1 per cent of national output by the end of 2015 two percentage points lower than is now proposed. The council recognises the difficulties the Government faces in adopting a clear fiscal stance in current economic conditions, given the uncertainties that surround the euro, and the weakening state of the world economy. With lower global growth widely forecast for 2012, Ireland, which relies on a buoyant export sector to boost economic recovery, is adversely affected. The Central Bank in its recent quarterly report acknowledged that by revising downwards its growth forecast for the domestic economy next year. But, like the fiscal council, the bank also favours a more aggressive approach to deficit reduction, arguing this would leave the public finances better placed to cope with negative shocks to the economy that may yet arise. Since 2008, there have been no fewer than six budgetary adjustments, yielding savings of some EUR 21 billion. But despite such austerity, progress in lowering the deficit has been slow. And for the Government to achieve its target of a 3 per cent figure in 2015 will involve four more years of painful fiscal adjustment. Part of the argument for beating the budget targets and surpassing public and investor expectations is that it could enable Ireland to re-enter the sovereign debt markets sooner, become less reliant on the EU and IMF troika, and recover some lost economic sovereignty. The council s role is to offer an independent assessment of the Government s budgetary plans, thereby also keeping the public better informed and more aware of policies and choices required to achieve fiscal sustainability. Last year, Klaus Regling and Max Watson, in their report on the banking crisis, proposed a fiscal council as one means of helping to ensure past mistakes in banking and economic management are not repeated. In the context of next December s budget this document now provides a framework for wide-ranging discussion and debate about how the burden of fiscal adjustment to 2015 will be carried, and by whom. It has already heightened tensions between the Coalition partners. At a time when consideration is being given to cutting the welfare budget with reductions of up to EUR 1 billion mooted the question of how much should be borne by the least well off remains the key political issue at the heart of the economic debate, and an indicator of society s fairness and compassion.",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
46,The Irish Times,28/12/2012,A fragile recovery,"The Irish economy at year-end finds itself in a healthier state than 12 months ago. After six austerity budgets since mid-2008, which have taken EUR 28.5 billion out of the economy in spending cuts and tax rises, Ireland is more than four-fifths of the way through the bailout programme agreed with international lenders. However, a recovering economy is still far from fully recovered, and is not yet out of danger. So far the Government has met all the fiscal targets set by the troika made up of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Government hopes to leave the programme next year and to resume market financing of its borrowing needs. In July, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) which manages Government debt returned to the sovereign bond market for the first time in almost two years. There, it raised EUR 4.2 billion, mostly from foreign investors. This success indicated growing international confidence in an Irish economic recovery. And that confidence is perhaps best exemplified by the large stake (EUR 8.5 billion 10 per cent of the Irish bond market) that one US investment firm, Franklin Templeton, has taken in Irish sovereign debt. An open economy Ireland with one of the world s most open economies is reliant on growth in international demand to sustain an export-led recovery. The challenge for the Government has been to try to facilitate economic growth while at the same time reducing the budget deficit, stabilising and lowering the debt. In 2012, the rate of economic growth has slowed as the year advanced, and as the external economic environment worsened. The US and UK markets account for almost half of all Irish exports, but conditions in both economies have deteriorated in recent months. In the US, growth has slowed while the UK and euro zone economies have both slipped back into recession. Growth in the Irish economy, which last year resumed for the first time since 2007, has continued in 2012, but at a slower pace an estimated 0.9 per cent of gross domestic product. The world economy in the past year has been marked by sustained uncertainty at two levels, political and financial. In the US, uncertainty about the outcome of the presidential election polarised public opinion and paralysed decision-making by lawmakers for months before the November vote. After the election, the slowness of politicians to agree measures to avert the fiscal cliff crisis has further depressed business investment in the US, and weakened consumer confidence. President Barack Obama has cut short his Christmas break to return to budget talks in Washington but he has until now resisted the big spending cuts Republicans are demanding in return for tax hikes on higher earners. If attempts to avert the fiscal cliff by January 2nd fail, automatic tax hikes and large spending cuts will come into effect and the risk of the US economy entering recession greatly increases. Encouraging signs In Europe by mid-year two turning points of significance, and of particular benefit to Ireland, were reached. In June, euro zone leaders agreed to examine the situation of the Irish financial sector, to help improve the sustainability of its adjustment programme. And they also agreed to break the link between sovereign and bank debt. That held out the prospect that the burden of debt assumed by the Government in rescuing the banks could be reduced when the new permanent bailout fund the Economic Stability Mechanism (ESM) is established. A month later Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, committed the bank to do whatever it takes to ensure the euro s survival. His pledge convinced financial markets, which had been pricing in the collapse of the single currency, that speculating on its demise was a likely losing bet. The effect of his statement was to reduce further Ireland s cost of borrowing, with the benchmark bond yield over 8 per cent in January well below 5 per cent by year-end. The economic outlook remains encouraging, with the unemployment rate showing signs of stabilising below 15 per cent. Ireland s economic recovery remains fragile and, as the IMF has pointed out, it would be wrong to underestimate the downside risk should projected growth targets for the economy fail to materialise. That could mean debt which is expected to peak in 2013 at 121 per cent of GDP rising faster than the economy is growing. And that would again raise questions about the sustainability of Ireland s debt. At the end of 2012, the optimists can see a light at the end of the tunnel, while the sceptics fear there may be another tunnel at the end of the light. Developments next year most probably outside Ireland will determine just who is right.",1,geopolitics,,,,,usa
47,The Irish Times,02/01/2009,A fundamental alteration of the landscape,"The Markets:The year started badly and went downhill from there, with little sign of improvement in 2009, writes Proinsias O'Mahony  'BAILOUT"" WAS Merriam-Webster's word of the year for 2008, so often was it looked up at the publisher's online dictionary. Other contenders included ""precipice"", ""trepidation"" and ""turmoil"", which pretty much sums up the type of year it has been for financial markets. The year began in miserable fashion, with January seeing global indices pummelled on grim US economic data. By March, financials were in freefall and concerns regarding the liquidity situation of investment bank Bear Stearns, which was facing massive losses due to its exposure to ailing mortgage-backed securities, led to a massive bank run. The US government, fearful that a Bear bankruptcy would trigger a domino effect in the financial sector, agreed to sponsor a JP Morgan-backed rescue deal. A ""sucker's rally"" ensued, with markets choosing to greet Bear's demise as likely marking some kind of climactic bottom. Financial chief executives agreed, with one after another assuring investors in the months that followed that ""the worst is over us"". It wasn't. Sub-prime related write-downs continued to mount, topping $500 billion by August. Increasingly desperate government efforts, including a $200 billion bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, failed to stem the bleeding. Speculation regarding the health of Lehman Brothers, a bigger investment bank than Bear and similarly exposed to toxic assets, continued to dog markets. Failed takeover talks led to Lehman's share price cratering in September. A frantic round of weekend negotiations ensued, with federal authorities and the leaders of some of the world's biggest banks hoping that bankruptcy could be avoided. In the end, the extent of Lehman's toxic assets meant that no bank was willing to touch it. The largest bankruptcy in US history, the fact that Lehman was allowed to fail stunned markets. Inter-bank lending dried up, with the London Interbank Overnight Rate (Libor) hitting record highs. Commercial paper markets froze and even healthy, credit-worthy firms were unable to secure short-term loans. Just days after Lehman's failure, the US government prevented an even bigger bankruptcy, lending $85 billion to insurance giant AIG (by the end of the year, the AIG bill had risen to over $150 billion). The contagion spread to Europe - Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands rescued Fortis; Denmark bailed out Ebh Bank; Iceland took over Glitnir, the country's third-biggest bank; Britain's Bradford Bingley was nationalised; while Germany gave a EUR 35 billion guarantee to protect Hypo Real Estate, with many blaming Depfa, Hypo's Irish subsidiary, for the property lender's problems. US authorities soon announced a $700 billion programme to buy back the banks' toxic assets only to change its mind and instead use the money for the purposes of financial recapitalisation. Markets rallied into the close of the year on foot of yet another financial rescue - this time Citigroup - but with volatility hitting all-time highs, continued financial uncertainty, bankruptcy fears for America's biggest carmakers and the world's biggest economies mired in recession, investors remain nervous. Despite the late rally, global markets still suffered their worst year since the 1930s. There was no safe haven for investors - the commodity bust was even larger than the stock market crash, with oil tumbling from a peak of $147 in July to the mid-s$30 in December. The chronic international situation was magnified in Ireland, with the Irish market suffering its worst year since records began in 1782. Disappointing data from Bapineuzumab, Elan's much- hyped Alzheimer drug, coupled with renewed safety concerns regarding Tysabri, its multiple sclerosis treatment, saw shares in the firm fall by over 80 per cent since July, thereby losing its status as Ireland's largest company by market capitalisation. That honour now belongs to CRH, which represented 30 per cent of the Iseq by December. Elan's fall was but a footnote in the Iseq's annus horribilis, however - the ailing fortunes of the country's four listed banks hogging the headlines. The financial index lost more than 90 per cent of its value and only the unprecedented Government guarantee of all bank debt saved at least one bank from going to the wall. That solved the immediate liquidity concerns and sparked a brief price pop but it did nothing to address the looming hole in bank balance sheets. It remains to be seen whether the recapitalisation plan announced just before Christmas is enough to restore a measure of confidence in the sector and the broader market. THE FINANCIAL landscape at the beginning of 2009, then, is a fundamentally altered one. America's investment banking model is dead, with Bear Stearns and Lehman in the graveyard, Merrill Lynch taken over and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley now commercial banks. Credit losses and write-downs topped $1 trillion in December and 2009 is likely to see that figure mount. This year, 2008, was also seen by many as the year that marked a decisive move away from the free market ideology that has prevailed over the last three decades, with many joking that the Bush administration entered office as social conservatives and left as conservative socialists. It is estimated that the US government has spent $8 trillion bailing out financial institutions - an incredible figure given that the US spent $3.6 trillion in today's terms during the second World War. Financials face much-increased regulation in the future while Keynesian economics is back in fashion as governments the world over launch large fiscal stimulus plans. Barack Obama's two-year fiscal stimulus plan is thought to be nearing the $1 trillion mark. Whether large-scale government intervention can prevent the world entering an economic depression remains to be seen. The first global recession since 1982 is thought to be a given, with the OECD, the World Bank and analysts the world over predicting as much for 2009. Harvard professor and former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff, who correctly predicted large-scale bank failure this year, says: ""We're going to face a deep downturn and slow recovery no matter what we do."" The challenge, he says, is ""to contain it to a couple of years and not a decade"". World Bank chief economist Justin Lin concurs, saying that the world is facing ""the worst recession since the Great Depression"". Mohammed El-Erian, joint chief executive of Pimco, the world's biggest bond fund, said the global economy suffered ""cardiac arrest"" in 2008 and ""the most central banks and governments can hope"" for may be to ""stop the deterioration and set the stage for recovery in 2010"". Failure ""may heighten the danger of deflation and near-depression"". Merrill Lynch is slightly less pessimistic in its 2009 outlook. ""Differences to the Great Depression are too many to take any comparison seriously,"" it says. Then, central banks reduced rather than increased money supply and thousands of banks were allowed to fail. ""Aggressive"" policy response means that a lost decade à la Japan in the 1990s is also unlikely. ""Fourteen years of Japanese experience have been replicated over 18 months,"" Merrill says. In fact, most analysts see equity gains. Strategists at Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse see European stocks gaining at least 20 per cent while the average American analyst envisages similar gains for the SP 500, the argument being that markets have already priced in global recession. Investors aren't jumping for joy, however, given that analysts also imagined strong gains in 2008. One near certainty for 2009 is that analyst earnings estimates will be sharply reduced. Despite being slashed in recent weeks, earnings growth of 14 per cent is still predicted. Zacks Dirk Van Dijk describes such numbers as ""borderline delusional"", adding that price- earnings ratios ""based on 2009 estimates will prove to be too low"". Actual results have been an average of 11 per cent lower than estimates over the last five quarters. Next year, 2009, is set to see continued financial deleveraging, with a recent survey finding that hedge funds are just over half way through the process of selling off assets. Global interest rates are expected to continue falling, with Bloxham Stockbrokers predicting possible ""record lows"" this year. Despite the economic misery, many value investors say that equities are cheap for the first time in decades. Renowned fund manager Jeremy Grantham, who predicted financial carnage in 2007, sees promising gains for investors over the next decade. He cautions that cheap stocks can get cheaper, however, especially in such an environment. For 2009, Grantham predicted: ""The period of heroic volatility will end pretty soon and will be replaced by a rather 1974-ish environment, where you quietly get bitterly resigned to your steady diet of bad news.""",1,debt,,,,,

And UK business confidence has hit a three-year low, even though the British economy continues to grow. An indicator monitoring sentiment across the 19-member bloc has fallen for the second month running, the lowest level since April of last year. The Sentix Economic Index warned that the global economy was now ""on the brink"", led by a downturn in the United States. It said investors believed the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December couldn't have come at a worse time and that the loss of momentum over the last two months was ""breath-taking"". ""The US economy is on the verge of a downturn,"" it said. ""The big picture hasn't changed at all,"" the Index warned. ""The global economy is on the brink as none of the regions covered by the sentix are sending signs of hope. ""Particularly battered are the regions of Latin America and Eastern Europe."" Meanwhile, a separate survey showed that business optimism among British companies has fallen to a three-year low, with Brexit fears adding to the gloom. The business optimism index from consultancy firm BDO - which predicts growth for six months ahead - fell to 100 for the first time since 2013. BDO said the findings come following a challenging start to the year for the global economy. The UK, it said, had previously been resilient to global economic fears, but headwinds from the American and Chinese economies and turmoil in the Middle East are finally starting to take their toll. ""Global headwinds are finally hitting business confidence and the added uncertainty of an EU referendum just round the corner is fuelling concerns,"" said Peter Hemington, BDO partner. ""So far the government has done a good job in sheltering the UK economy from global storms but there is more that could be done."" BDO said the poor performance of the manufacturing sector continues to weigh down the UK economy in the short term. ""The impending referendum on the UK's membership of the EU - expected as early as June - is fuelling further uncertainty for UK businesses looking at their long-term prospects.""

49,The Irish Times,03/04/2020,A hard and lasting hit; Economic outlook,"The immediate economic price of the coronavirus is quickly becoming evident. The numbers relying on unemployment or special income supports has soared to over 500,000 - and will go higher. Taxes in March were 20 per cent down on the same month last year as spending taxes tanked. And the Central Bank's latest report says that the economy might contract by 8 -9 per cent this year, with an even bigger initial hit during the shutdown period. None of this is surprising, but it is sobering. People are losing their jobs and others face an uncertain outlook for their employer. The ripples are spreading across the economy, and nobody can say with any confidence when some kind of economic normality might return, or what it might look like. It is entirely reliant on the success of the vital work of trying to suppress the outbreak and difficult judgments on what happens then. The economy will recover when the restrictions are eased, but there are two main concerns. One is the longer they have to continue, the more long-term economic damage will be done. Given the likelihood that the restrictions will be eased slowly and gradually, some businesses will simply not survive and some jobs lost will not be immediately regained. The second is whether some sectors may take even longer to recover - tourism could be vulnerable here if people are nervous of travelling, for example. Given the speed at which the crisis has hit, the Government and other public authorities, including the Central Bank, have responded quickly and, generally, appropriately. Widescale income supports are costly but essential, and other measures to help those with mortgages or renting are also vital. More may be needed, including in the key area of business credit. The Government has committed significant sums and will have to spend more, but difficult decisions lie ahead, too, on what it can and cannot afford to do. For the moment the job is one of damage limitation; we must hope that a successful effort to control the virus can lead to the focus moving - sooner rather than later - to the big task of rebuilding.",1,taxes,covid,,,,
50,The Irish Times,22/01/1993,A hard currency at any cost is not the solution to the crisis,"WITH one bound our hero is free. This was the reaction of one Government official as the speculative pressures eased on the pound in the past week. But the currency crisis is far from over. Even if the selling pressures on the currency remain subdued, the squeeze on exporting industry caused by the weakness of the British currency will remain and the renewed weakness of the British currency is a serious concern for the Irish authorities. Interest rates also remain at record levels compared to the - rate of inflation, even if pressures for another mortgage rate rise have eased temporarily. A few temporary subsidy measures and schemes cannot provide a long-term solution to these problems. The market development fund, set up as, a subsidy to aid exporting industry, can only give limited, short-term relief to companies hit by the sharp fall of sterling. Injecting lower-interest rate funds borrowed abroad into the Irish financial system can only hold interest rates down for so long, unless there is a fundamental improvement in the market. But despite these problems the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, felt confident enough to proclaim victory in the currency crisis at a party function this week, declaring that speculators and certain ""financial commentators"" had their money on the wrong horse in calling for a devaluation. But the cost to the economy of the Government's strategy is large, and the Government may be disappointed by the 'winnings"" from its bet. The short-term costs of holding our position in the Exchange Rate Mechanism are worth it, we are told, to safeguard long-term economic gains. But political, more than economic, considerations appear to be driving the Government on. In particular, the political system does not want to concede that the economy still retains, and always will, many crucial economic links with Britain. Policy in recent years has been based on building trade and monetary links with continental Europe and the Government sees strong political arguments for continuing this process. We are not, the Taoiseach said, going to return to a state of permanent dependence"" on the British economy. But with' unemployment at crisis levels and likely to rise sharply further, the primary focus of policy-,makers should be on addressing this problem, rather than on the requirements laid down for EC Economic and Monetary Union, t he future of which now looks' most uncertain. The way things are going, the fight to try to make the pound a hard Euro-currency is going to cost a lot of jobs. Manufacturing companies exporting to Britain are facing a sterling exchange rate now around 15 per cent higher than before the crisis broke. The Government may try to persuade us that the improved competitiveness of industry over the past few years means it can live with such a rate. The truth is as industrialists have been saying privately since the crisis started, and are now start ing to say publicly, that Irish companies cannot compete in the British market, or against British competitors in the Irish or other markets. The market development fund cannot hope to compensate for the se losses on a continuing basis, Now the pound is back over 108p sterling and each day a different' industry is threatening big job losses. The Government will feel pressure not only because of redundancies due to the pound/sterling rate, but also because of the high level of interest rates. Borrowing costs for businesses and householders are already punishingly high and another mortgage rise cannot be ruled out. The financial institutions complain that they have been subsidising borrowers for a lengthy period and the building societies and the banks doubt that the Government scheme will compensate them sufficiently for not pushing up mortgage rates. It is usually hard to summon up sympathy for the institutions, almost all of which are profitable, but the societies and the banks are obviously now paying muc h higher interest rates for r aising funds than they are for lending them ou t. This can only continue for a limited period. Together with the low-interest rate overseas loans, an in- flow of foreign investment funds is needed if wholesale money rates are to fall and pressure is to come off mortgage and other borrowing rate's. Overseas investors will remain nervous of the Irish market unless sterling again gains ground. No easy solution presents itself to the Government. But its policy should not be ""a hard currency at all costs."" At the moment, the extent of the costs being imposed on the economy suggest that a devaluation of the pound would be a better course, preferably by way of a general realignment but, if not, on a unilateral basis. It would offer relief to exporters and th e chance, if accompanied by appropriate policies in other areas, of gradually rebuilding international confidence in the pound, allowing some easing of interest rates. If the Government decides to hold out, it can, of course, expect continued pats on the back, but little more, from our EC partners. At the same time, we are heading for an extraordinary policy mix involving a strong currency, real interest rates of at least 12 to 13 per cent, pay increases well in excess of the rate of inflation and record unemployment levels. Being good Europeans is involving more and more costly economics.",1,debt,,,,,
51,Irish Independent,15/11/2013,A leap of faith; Markets respond positively to snap announcement ? Angela Merkel says we are ready to go it alone ? Ireland to leave bailout programme with no safety net ; Our leap of faith - now we're going it alone now we're going it alone ; ? Kenny rejects 'safety net' ? Markets welcome decision,"INTERNATIONAL investors have backed Ireland''s decision to make a clean break from our punishing EU/IMF bailout programme without a safety net. Ireland''s cost of borrowing money on world markets fell - and the stock market here rose - after Taoiseach Enda Kenny''s snap announcement of the decision. Traders said the leap of faith finally ""gives clarity"" to investors and was a ""sign of Ireland''s confidence"" as we prepare to stand on our own two feet. But experts have warned that the real test of the strategy will come early next year when the Government has to borrow funds on the international markets. Ireland has been given assurances by its European and international partners that they will continue to offer their full support to this country. Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan said it was the right decision to go without the backstop. Mr Honohan - who famously announced on RTE radio that Ireland would need a bailout in November 2010 - said: ""I would have done the same thing for Ireland"". He called the decision a ""statement of intent"" but warned that ""debt levels are very high"". The Taoiseach said German Chancellor Angela Merkel had pledged to work closely with Ireland to improve funding mechanisms for the economy, including access to finance for small and medium businesses. ""The German government has asked KFW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date,"" he said. This means that small Irish companies should be able to access funding at a cheaper interest rate from Germany than the rate that is being offered to them by Irish banks. At the moment, the average interest rate being charged to an Irish small company is 4.5pc - more than twice the corresponding rate in Germany. Continued on Page 2 From Page One Mr Kenny told the Dail: ""We will exit the bailout in a strong position. The Government has been preparing for a return to normal market trading. ""This is the right decision for Ireland."" "" German Chancellor Angela Merkel also publicly backed the Government's decision, saying: ""Ireland is ready for this step. Germany is confident that the Irish Government is acting in the best interests of the Irish people and the Irish economy."" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the performance of Ireland boded well for the future. ""The Irish authorities have established a very strong track record of policy implementation. This bodes well as Ireland exits its EU/IMF-supported programme,"" she said. ""Although uncertainties remain in Europe and the global economy more broadly, Ireland is in a strong position in terms of its bond yields and has built a sizeable cash buffer. ""We look forward to continuing to work with the authorities as they address the challenges that remain."" But analysts warned that Ireland would have to test the market early next year to prove the exit strategy had worked. ""It is important to follow through; they need to get back to the markets and show they can issue bonds on a regular basis. This is not just about next year, it is about the next decade,"" said Padhraic Garvey, a senior bond analyst at ING Bank in the Netherlands. However, Mr Garvey said that yesterday's decision provided ""clarity"" for investors. Ryan McGrath, a bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald in Dublin, said investor sentiment had actually been boosted by the decision. ""It is a vote of confidence by the Government in itself and that is reassuring for investors,"" he said. There could even be a read across for investors to the banks, he said, because the decision suggests the Government believes that the main lenders will come through next year's stress test without needing more aid. The decision not to seek a special overdraft facility was finalised at an emergency Cabinet meeting ahead of Finance Minister Michael Noonan flying out to a summit in Brussels. Ireland will leave the bailout, which has been overseen by Europe and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 2010, on December 15. The Department of Finance said the Government''s assessment was that leaving the (EURO)67bn bailout programme without a so-called backstop of credit was the best option. It said market and sovereign conditions were now favourable towards Ireland. The country had built up more than (EURO)20bn in cash reserves since returning to the international money markets last year. Cash reserves The department said this could be used to keep Ireland in the black until early 2015. It also said the latest Budget, announced last month, had been designed to deliver a primary balance or small surplus. ""Domestic and international economic conditions are improving, monetary policy decisions are conducive to exit and confidence and sentiment towards Ireland have improved considerably in recent months,"" the department said. Ireland''s finances, Budgets and policies have been overseen by a troika of the IMF, the European Central Bank and European Commission since they agreed to the massive loan package in late 2010. In an understated address to the Dail confirming the end of the bailout, Mr Kenny warned, however, that difficult days for the country still lay ahead. ""Neither today''s decision, nor the exit from the bailout in December, means the end of difficult economic decisions. There are still demanding times ahead,"" he told TDs. ""It does not mean any windfall of cash. It won''t mean that our economic and financial challenges are over."" "" Mr Kenny said the Government would publish a medium term economic strategy - a plan based on enterprise and not the speculation that led to the country's collapse five years ago. ""Never again will our country''s fortunes be sacrificed to speculation, greed and short-term gain,"" he said. Despite a cautious tone in the announcement, the opposition accused the Government of ""bravado"". Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Budgetary Affairs, said Ireland was well placed to make a successful and durable move from the bailout to normal funding. Mr Rehn said Ireland was an example which showed that implementation of a comprehensive reform agenda could decisively turn around a country''s economic fortunes. ""I know the Irish Government has reflected very carefully on this matter,"" he said.

52,The Irish Times,02/02/2008,A little less gloom on the economy,"  Economic growth this year will be only half as fast as in 2007, the Central Bank forecasts in its quarterly bulletin, yesterday. The bank projects that the pace of economic growth will decelerate from 5.1 per cent in 2007 to 2.6 per cent this year. Yet, despite the forecast economic slowdown, the Central Bank's assessment of the State's economic prospects is not without an element of optimism.   The bank points out that the economy registered a strong performance in 2007, with the growth rate exceeding 5 per cent. In particular, exports surpassed all expectations, with the volume of goods and services sold abroad increasing by 6.9 per cent. As a result, the bank estimates that Ireland increased its share of world trade in 2007 for the first time in many years. This year, despite the slowdown, Ireland's forecast growth rate stands up well when compared against the prospective performance of neighbouring economies. For 2008, Ireland's projected growth rate in real Gross National Product, at 2.6 per cent, exceeds the expected growth rates for the euro area, Britain, and the US. Most importantly of all, the Central Bank foresees light at the end of the slowdown. It points out that, once the correction in the housing market is completed, the economy can look forward to a modest pick-up in economic performance. In consequence, it foresees growth recovering towards 4 per cent in 2009 and subsequent years. Striking such a note of optimism is salutary at the present time. With international financial markets embroiled in turmoil, stock markets plagued by volatility and the global economy clouded in uncertainty, it is important to recognise that the Irish economy has a sound and solid future in the years ahead. The boom of the last 15 years created a wave of irrational exuberance. Too many houses were built. Too much cash was spent. Too many prices were raised excessively. Too much money was borrowed. The culture of conspicuous consumption engendered by the boom was unsustainable. Now, rationality is returning. In this process - painful in itself - it is important to differentiate between a temporary correction and a prolonged downturn. The slowdown that the economy is experiencing is not the first step on the road to a depression. The reassurance by the Central Bank that the economy can return to relatively strong growth by 2009 is therefore timely. Reassurance, however, should not invite complacency. A key element in reviving growth lies in regaining competitiveness. The full effects of the deterioration in Irish competitiveness in recent years have yet to be felt in lost export sales and the migration of companies from Ireland to lower cost locations. The Government needs to respond by developing a coherent strategy on restoring competitiveness, embracing pay, productivity, foreign investment and diversifying exports. This is the new economic agenda.  ",1,monetary,,,,,
53,The Irish Times,29/12/2012,"A lot done, more to do: EU in 2013 - Correction Appended","In the fourth year of Europe s debt saga, EU leaders must still settle some of the most fundamental questions raised by the debacle. The ordeal continues, even if the ECB s bond-buying policy took some of the sting from the crisis after September. This year ends with the EU at something of a crossroads. For all the failings in their response to the Greek debt explosion in 2009 and what followed, EU leaders still managed to prevent the euro splintering. That s no small thing. There were many perilous moments when break-up seemed a real and growing threat. Still, the prevailing atmosphere is one of acute uncertainty. The EU powers have yet to provide a convincing long-term plan to heal the abundant frailties of the euro s weakest members or to secure the currency s long-term survival. That is the challenge they must still overcome. As the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, faces an election in September, concern surrounds her narrowing scope for manoeuvre and her habitual caution. As she has done since the beginning of the imbroglio, the chancellor will set the pace on the depth of Europe s response. At issue in the months ahead will be the scope of new efforts to deepen the economic alignment of the euro-zone countries. Doubt persists as to the form or timing of the banking union initiative. Whether it meets the objective of severing the link between bank and sovereign debt may depend on whether any bank debt is mutualised. Merkel and her Dutch and Finnish allies are opposed. No change is likely before the German election. Further doubt surrounds Britain s place in the union, the prospect of a tricky referendum on its place in the EU and the growing risk that it might leave altogether. This is to say nothing of deepening tensions in the strained alliance between Germany and France, for decades the unyielding motor of European integration. On top of all that, events in countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece could disrupt the relative calm of recent months. What happens next in each could be pivotal. Will Silvio Berlusconi return to the fray in Rome? Will Madrid need a full-blown bailout? Can Athens execute a EUR 13.5 billion austerity plan? Irish prominence The danger for Ireland in this is that any resurgence of the crisis could compromise the effort to break free of the bailout next year. Both in its domestic and European policy, that remains the Government s priority (see panel). While the six-month rotating presidency of the EU will give heightened prominence to the Coalition come January, its main task will be to steer numerous pieces of complex legislation through ministerial councils. At the top of the in-tray is the still-unresolved seven-year EU budget from 2014 onwards. A special budget summit in November broke down without a deal, so it now falls to the European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, to push for compromise. For the Irish presidency, the lack of an early agreement delays the preparation of 68 items of European legislation needed to give effect to the new EU budget. This serves to complicate the challenge facing Taoiseach Enda Kenny. For the EU, the very lack of a budget deal stands as a further damaging example of Europe failing to agree on essential political questions when the pressure is really on. If this was merely a repeat showing of the tensions seen in the debt drama, the budget story illustrates how deep the schisms now run. When the British prime minister, David Cameron, found a friend in Merkel in his push for a hearty dose of budgetary restraint, three powerful forces were evident. First the growing clamour from Tory eurosceptics for Cameron to call a referendum on Britain s membership. Cameron would prefer a vote to loosen ties to the union while remaining inside. Either way, momentum now favours a moment of truth for Europe with a doubtful British electorate. Second was Merkel s determination to do all in her power to keep Cameron on side and to avoid isolating him in the summit chamber. In the febrile Westminster debate, in which the EU has few champions, isolation for Cameron would only magnify the risk of an eventual exit. Third was the sense that the chancellor was willing to leave French president François Hollande to himself as he tries to cultivate a new political alliance with southern countries such as Spain and Italy. This was but a further reflection of a divide between Merkel and Hollande. She favours fiscal rectitude as the panacea to the crisis while he promotes economic growth over austerity. With unity between France and Germany the essential precondition for European progress on anything, this augurs badly. For the last 20 years, all summits were precooked by Germany and France. That s just about gone, says a senior European figure. Eyes on the prize: Ireland's struggle to return to the markets The Irish Government faces a moment of truth in 2013 as it strives to break free of the EU-IMF bailout and regain access to private debt markets. Although the Coalition continues to win plaudits in Europe for its unswerving execution of the rescue programme, it remains to be seen whether it can definitively convince international investors Ireland is worthy of confidence. Crucial here is Dublin s campaign for bank-debt relief from its European partners, which may make the difference between a smooth return to markets or rejection, as well as whether the euro-zone atmosphere is calm or not. The stakes are enormous. Success would enable the Kenny administration to declare the restoration of Irish economic sovereignty after the shrill indignities of foreign intervention under Fianna Fáil and the Greens. That is a glittering political prize, even if the coarse economic diet of swingeing cutbacks and grinding tax increases is unpopular. The inexorable seepage of national policy discretion under the fiscal treaty and other new European laws means economic sovereignty is a much leaner in any case. Failure to win investor support would mean more emergency aid, eroding Government credibility further. So the drive to shake off the troika shackles is the Government s top priority. If Ireland s EU presidency carries prestige after humiliations, the real benefit is the scope it gives to demonstrate competence and professionalism to the world. The rescue loans run out next autumn, but Ireland will still run a very large budget deficit and big debts mature in 2014 and 2015. The reality is the countdown has already begun. The NTMA made a tentative return to markets in 2012, and declining bond yields mark a reduction in national borrowing costs. They are highly positive developments, but do not necessarily mean the Government will be able to stand without crutches. A debt relief deal remains elusive. Goodwill towards Ireland has yet to translate into a firm arrangement to recast the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note scheme or for the ESM fund to shoulder debts for AIB or BoI. The political and legal difficulties are legion but EU leaders recognise Ireland remains the only prospect they have of an early exit from the bailout zone. This plays into Kenny s hand, and he knows it. Correction The end of year review published in last Saturday s edition gave misleading figures for Ireland s public debt.  The official estimate of public debt at December 31st, 2012 was EUR 192 billion, compared with EUR 169 billion a year previously. Correction-Date: January 3, 2013 ",1,debt,,,,,europe
54,The Irish Times,03/02/1993,"A Nazi past, a powerful present, an uncertain futureThe future role and influence of the powerful German central bank, the Bundesbank, is itself called into question by proposals for a common currency,","IN SEPTEMBER last year, the Bundesbank scuppered the English pound by hinting that sterling should be devalued, then giving minimal' support when the markets took the hint; next, it saved the franc, which would surely have been devalued without such determined support. Part of the fall-out was fury in Britain, where the Bundesbank found its alleged Nazi past paraded across the newspapers, while in ,France it was feted with almost equal verve. The Nazi ancestry of the Bundesbank has been charted in a recent book by the journalist, David Marsh, which shows how people who were prominent in the German business and financial establishment in the 1930s resurfaced in the 1950s. Using this lineage to attack the Bundesbank now (which Mr Marsh does not) is absurd as well as deeply offensive. But the fact that the jibe can be made at all by paid-up Europhobes illustrates the degree of continuity in any society and, more pertinently, how the rest of Europe, and not just the British, regard the newly unified Germany. The Bundesbank is not perfect, nor is it all-powerful. But it is very good at its job, and as such is rather frightening. For the last '100 years, there has been an immense economy at the centre of Europe. At the centre of that economy is the German central bank, serving Germ,an economic and political interests. Germany's economic and political record over this period has been, to, put it mildly, uneven, as has the record of its central bank. But now, just as once again German industry dominates the European economy, the Bundesbank dominates European finance. Thus, it has become central to what is sometimes dubbed the ""German problem"", shorthand for the dominant role Germany has played for the last 100 years. The Bundesbank was formally created in 1957, but its ancestry goes back to the Bank Deutscher Lander, founded in 1948 by the British and Americans as a central bank for the western zones of Germany. Indirectly, it goes back to the Reichsbank, the hapless organisation that presided over the hyperinflation of the early 1920s. The president, Rudolf Havenstein, died of a heart attack brought on by the stress this caused. His successor, Hjalmar Schacht, became the servant of the Nazis in the 1930s: many of the senior staff of the Bank Deutscher Lander and the regional central banks worked at the Reichsbank before the war. The best way to get a feel for the Bundesbank is to go there, for the contrast between it and the Bank of England could hardly be greater. The Bank of England is at the core of the City in a 1920s-style building that could hardly be anything other than a bank headquarters. You are greeted by pink- coated footmen. Inside, you are escorted along cavernous marble corridors to drawing rooms where the senior staff sit behind their mahogany desks in slightly embarrassed splendour. The Bundesbank is on the outskirts of Frankfurt in a building dating from the 1960s that could easily be a hospital or the headquarters of a multinational. You are greeted by guards with sub-machine guns. Inside, you are led along cream carpets to suites where the senior staff show you to leather couches with polite self-confidence. One displays the symbols of power of two generations ago; the other the reality of power now. The path from the ruins of the Reichsbank is much like the path of the German economy. In the immediate post-war period, the staff sought, above all, to be competent technocrats. For some this was a refuge from a Nazi past; for more, simply a rejection of everything that had gone before. Inevitably, perhaps', people who had served the Nazis did re-emerge in prominent positions: Karl Blessing, president of the Bundesbank during an extremely important phase in its development from 1958-69, was a key member of the Reichsbank board in the 1930s and spent much of the war organising German industry's war effort. He narrowly escaped being charged for war crimes. Today, the bank is run by a disparate group. The president, Dr Helmut Schlesinger; his predecessor, Karl-Otto Phol; and his designated successor, Hans Tietmeyer, are all very different people: crudely, the sybarite, the academic and the puritan. But they have in common the fact that they all come from humble families and have made their own various paths to the top. The senior staff of the Bundesbank will pride 'themselves on being right: ""We are arrogant because we are good."" The record supports this, for the Bundesbank has presided over the world's strongest currency. True, it has been helped by the political climate in Germany: governments will tend to support increases in interest rates, partly on the ground that this rewards savers and partly because it reflects ""firmness"", Contrast that with the tenor of the political debate in Britain. But the staff do not always call the shots: on the Bundesbank's council they are outnumbered by representatives of the regional central banks. Now the Bundesbank is at a turning point, Despite its competence and its independence, it has never been all-powerful within Germany. Unification showed this. It may determine Europe's interest rates, but it did not decide the rate at which the Ostmark, the old East German currency, should be converted into the mark. That decision - one-for-one - was made by the German Government, against the advice of the Bundesbank. The next issue is a bigger one: to what extent will the Bundesbank cede power if Europe is to have a single currency? If it does have to cede power to any significant extent, the very future of the institution is at stake. If it does not, then it is very hard to see Europe having a true common currency. So, at exactly the moment when the Bundesbank seems at the height of its power, it is also fighting for its life. T he history of the past 80 years shows how there is a German central banking tradition which transcends economic and military catastrophe. The history of the past 40 years shows how determined German central bankers have been to avoid the mistakes of the previous 40, and how they have succeeded in doing so. The present strength of the mark is the Bundesbank's triumph. What is beyond dispute is that the tale must take another twist. Either Europe races towards a common currency, with an EC central banking system; or the mark becomes de facto the common currency, with the Bundesbank the only central bank that matters. If this is a disturbing prospect for the Bundesbank, it is an even more disturbing one for Europe. -",1,monetary,euro ,,,,germany
55,The Irish Times,05/01/2013,A new approach to public sector pay vital for recovery,"ANALYSIS:In its fiscal strategy for the post-troika medium term, the Government should rethink public sector salaries This is set to be a pivotal year for the Government s economic strategy. At the same time that it seeks to run an efficient and successful EU presidency, it must devote considerable energy to addressing both short-term and medium-term challenges in supporting economic recovery and the restoration of sustainability to the public finances. In the short term, a basic challenge is to fully implement the measures set out in the 2013 budget. Around the world, implementation drift is a common factor behind the failure of recovery programmes, so the successful execution of the announced measures cannot be taken for granted. In addition to the property tax regime, a key task is to secure the public sector expenditure savings and productivity gains that the Government believes can be achieved under the Croke Park agreement. Moving beyond budgetary issues, the restructuring of the banking system remains a fundamental ongoing task for the Government. In this regard, 2013 is a critical year in relation to the necessary resolution of troubled household debts in the context of new personal insolvency legislation. At the international level, the Government s financial exposure to the banking system should be ameliorated by a re-engineering of the promissory notes and further progress can be envisaged on preparing the ground for the future disposal of the State s equity stakes in the banks, whether to the European Stability Mechanism or private investors. As listed in the memorandum of understanding with the EU-International Monetary Fund-European Central Bank troika, the list of short-term tasks for 2013 also includes water services reform, labour market reform and greater progress on the sale of State assets. More broadly, the Government has to continue rebuilding Ireland s reputation as an attractive hub for international business, while supporting the growth of sustainable indigenous enterprises (in both the export and domestic sectors). What makes 2013 a pivotal year is that, in parallel to accomplishing these myriad short-term objectives, the Government must also develop and communicate a credible medium-term fiscal strategy that will shape policy decisions in the post-troika era. The spelling out of an explicit medium-term strategy is essential for several reasons. First, the Government will only be able to raise the large amounts of medium-term funding it requires from the markets (to fund the projected deficits from 2014 onwards and refinance the debt issues that will mature in the coming years) if there is clarity about how it intends to deliver the challenging fiscal targets required to gradually reduce public debt. The progressive reduction of public debt (relative to gross domestic product) is desirable in view of the risks attached to a persistently high stock of debt, while it is also mandated under the fiscal treaty. Second, the planned end of the troika funding programme means that the Government will have to take on a stronger leadership role in articulating and justifying the annual targets for the fiscal balance and mix of spending and taxation decisions in its medium-term strategy. Put differently, the implication of restored economic sovereignty is that the Government must take the lead in setting out a fiscal programme that is both convincing to the markets and politically acceptable to the domestic electorate. Of course, the fiscal programme must also meet the minimal fiscal targets for 2014 and 2015 set out in the troika agreement and satisfy the new European-level appraisal system but these are consistent with a considerable range of fiscal strategies, so that domestic leadership remains paramount. Third, a commitment to a clear medium-term fiscal strategy can help in supporting economic recovery, since uncertainty about the level and composition of taxes is a deterrent to investment and the location decisions of highly mobile workers. Fourth, it is important that details of the medium-term strategy are settled as soon as possible, since the international evidence indicates that it gets increasingly difficult for governments to make tough economic commitments as the date of the next general election draws closer. Building in resilience A basic problem in setting out any medium-term fiscal strategy is that the prospects for economic growth remain quite uncertain. To this end, a core objective should be to improve the resilience of Ireland s fiscal position in the event of future downturns. In particular, a new approach to the setting of public-sector pay rates is highly desirable. Rather than committing to irrevocably fixed pay schedules (a commitment that could only have limited credibility given recent experience), an explicit two-part pay structure would balance the importance of stable incomes for public-sector workers with the need for fiscal flexibility. Such a two-part pay system would guarantee the vast bulk of agreed pay rates (subject to meeting productivity and reform targets) as secure Part A pay, while reserving the option to cancel or hold back a portion of Part B pay in the event of a specified decline in macroeconomic performance. The guaranteed nature of Part A pay would allow public-sector workers to conduct financial planning without the trauma imposed by the unexpected pay reductions imposed during this crisis, while the conditional nature of the Part B pay component would recognise that the macroeconomic risk facing the country has to be borne to some degree by public-sector workers. Negative alternatives The alternatives to such a limited form of pay flexibility are either costly fluctuations in public-sector employment or excessive tax volatility. In contrast to the current Croke Park agreement, the trigger for any such pay adjustments should be explicitly specified to allow for external third-party monitoring and forestall any disputes on the meaning of the agreement. One of the lessons of the euro crisis is that national macroeconomic stability inside a monetary union requires new instruments to replace the traditional policy option of currency devaluation. This two-part pay strategy can play an important role. If successfully introduced in the public sector, this type of pay system might also be adopted in domestically exposed industries in the private sector that face similar macroeconomic risks. In formulating the medium-term strategy, the Government also needs to take seriously the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council that the deficit should be reduced more quickly than is envisaged under the current plan. The sizeable risks attached to high public debt (especially given the prevalence of high sovereign debts in other countries and vulnerability to contagion crises) should not be underestimated. The Government has delivered much in terms of economic adjustment; it is important that it does not declare victory too early.

56,The Irish Times,06/04/2015,A recovering economy; Exchequer returns,"The latest exchequer figures were even better than expected, showing a strong revival of tax revenues. Again, the Government is likely to beat its deficit target for the year, helped by a lower than expected financing cost on the national debt. Spending also remains generally under control. The figures provide further evidence of a revival in the economy. Tax revenues are up 13.4 per cent on last year and are 5.5 per cent ahead of target. Despite budget reductions in income tax, the take here is still growing strongly ahead of target and almost 8 per cent ahead of last year, largely reflecting a pick-up in job creation. VAT revenues are rising strongly, due to a rise in consumer spending. The economy still has entrenched problems after the economic crisis; unemployment, while falling, is still high and debt levels are also a problem for many households.  The national debt burden also remains high and the gap between spending and revenue has still to be completely closed.  Yet it would be churlish not to recognise the extraordinary turnaround which has left the economy and the public finances in a much more advanced stage of recovery than could have been anticipated. There are reasons for optimism and evidence of the underlying strength of the economy and its ability to deliver increased living standards in the years ahead, given a fair wind in terms of international economic trends.  A few years of growth and low interest rates could deliver a significant dividend and laying the foundations for this steady progress needs to be the priority. The outlines for the next budget are not yet clear. Negotiations are under way with the EU regarding the rules governing the leeway which the Government will have. The spring economic statement, due towards the end of the month, will give the first clear indication of what the Government plans. A key priority must be not to do anything to upset the recovery that is now clearly under way. The old medical maxim is appropriate: ""first , do no harm"".  The Government also needs to recognise that reducing the deficit and the national debt burden remain vital. Uncertainties remain in the international growth outlook. Whatever the Government does, it needs not to upset the foundations for stability and growth for the next few years.  Political reality may dictate some spending increases and tax cuts on budget day, the last opportunity to do this before the general election. But the priority must remain correcting the public finances and stabilising our position, for the simple reason that this strategy appears to be working.  The return of growth brings challenges to the Government as it faces down rising demands. That said, they are easier problems to deal with than the dire choices faced by this Government and its predecessor in the midst of the crisis. ",0,,,,,,
57,Irish Independent,29/02/2016,"A result that brings uncertainty, not chaos; All 158 TDs face a big obligation to bring workable solutions to a new political order offering opportunities","THEY had billed it as a ""Chaos or US"" choice. But voters did not buy into that premise and they used the ballot box to tell their political leaders. The Irish people clearly did not like the experience of five years under this Fine Gael-Labour coalition led by Enda Kenny. In the end two out of three of those going to the polls on Friday took their political trade elsewhere, to throw up a very diverse 32nd Dáil which is due to meet in 11 days' time. Most voters did not believe that Enda Kenny and Michael Noonan had saved the country, helped by Labour's Eamon Gilmore and later Joan Burton with Brendan Howlin ever present. Voters did not accept that this band had rescued us from the economic abyss we were in back in 2011. Furthermore, the voters really disliked the implications of being told that failure to return the outgoing Coalition meant a certain return to that economic abyss. It was a scare too far for a people who have been badly scared on many occasions since the known economic world fell asunder in autumn 2008, throwing up an economic crisis to which Ireland was inordinately vulnerable. The Fine Gael message ""Let's Keep the Recovery Going"" was especially poorly received. Slogans are not necessarily important of themselves at election time. Many pundits, including this writer, thought it was a good battle-cry at the outset. But slogans do indicate a state of mind among those campaigning to seek reelection. There was clearly too much metropolitan influence upon those who shaped the campaign strategy of Fine Gael. Too many people around the country only felt the effects of recovery very recently, if at all. Late on in the campaign, Fine Gael quietly downplayed that theme. They began more wisely with talk of ""Sharing the Recovery."" But the posters and flyers were already out there and the campaign message was set. Labour's case was even more difficult. They were trying to put their brand on an economic recovery which was real. They were billing themselves as a party of social progress who would use another term to put more humanity into society through better health, housing and other services. Both parties had done good work over the previous five years. They vastly reduced the national deficit, made inroads on long-term debt and more recently almost halved unemployment. But it involved dishing out some harsh economic medicine. And it involved making rash promises which were never going to be fulfilled in a bankrupt country under economic supervision by the EU-IMFECB Troika. There are grounds for believing that things could have been different if both parties - and especially Labour - had come out early, say in autumn 2011, and fessed up that their election promises were not deliverable. A better effort to explain the need for austerity just might have blunted continuing public sullen anger and defused things earlier. It is of course, easy to be wise after the event. But both government parties got their election campaign rather badly wrong. The outcome, involving heavy losses for both parties, means that the future of Fine Gael leader, Enda Kenny, and Labour's Joan Burton looks decidedly www.shaky.No political party does regicide quite like Fine Gael and it is almost six years since their last failed attempt on Mr Kenny's leadership in June 2010. The loss of 20 TDs and the failure to cleanly deliver a first ever backto-back term in government are surely grounds www.enough.No surprise, that Mr Kenny sought to fortify his position by moving into ""putative Taoiseach space"" on his first postelection appearance in Castlebar on Saturday night. It's not so easy for would-be rebels to wield the dagger in that circumstance. Being about the business of government making with the mosaic that is the composition of the new Dáil buys Mr Kenny time. But he may be only postponing the inevitable. Ms Burton's case is even more pressing. Her predecessor, Eamon Gilmore, to whom she showed scant loyalty, was peremptorily ""oxtered"" out of office following less calamitous local election results for Labour in May 2014. The only impediment to a similar fate for her is the extent of shell-shock across Labour where future existence is called into question. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin emerges with some credit as the party completed what they will style the first part of their recovery. Such talk is very much in doubt. But for now he is entitled to celebrate in pulling out a result few predicted was possible. However, what Mr Martin and his colleagues, old and new, do next is far from evident. They will come under big pressure to take bold action to help form a government. Sinn Féin can claim some success and are leaning heavily on comparisons with 2011. But privately they will reflect on what they left behind. They are also facing much bigger competition from a renewed left which is both suspicious of and has great antipathy for Sinn Féin. Mr Adams and his colleagues will fervently hope that Fine Gael move towards that ""grand coalition"" with Fianna Fáil. His key party people are already trying to push things in that direction. On paper this historic realignment of Irish politics, via the coming together of the two big political beasts, would deliver a government backed by a big majority. Getting there would however be extremely problematic. Both parties must first go through various steps and especially exclude other possibilities. These include other coalition permutations most of which seem like longshots. There is also the prospect of putting together some kind of minority government, supported externally by either of the big two. The problem here is that these possibilities appear like long-shots also as both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are far short of the magic 80 TDs needed for majority. Past minority governments were just a small number of deputies short of the required majority. The extent of the current gap looks especially problematic. The other potential solution is some kind of interparty government for which we must reach far back into our history for a precedent in the years 1948-51 and again in 1954-57. The first of these involved five parties and was led by Fine Gael. The other four parties were longdeparted Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan along with the split Labour and National Labour parties. The second interparty government involved Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan and external support from Clann na Poblachta. Given the times they were in, they worked well enough for a period. They did involve Fine Gael having to put a compromise Taoiseach in John A Costello in 1948 as their leader, Richard Mulcahy, proved unacceptable. The historic allusion raises questions about any such future move. But it does not rule things out. Would Enda Kenny have to stand aside? Or, maybe Micheál Martin? Or both? We do not know and we will not for quite some time. The reconvening of the Dáil on March 10 is unlikely to give us a result. Things could drag on and weeks could become months before we get a new government. But in an uncertain world, with some very worrying economic challenges looming, we cannot hang about here. All the parties and Independents had better get a move on. The quest for a workable government means all 158 TDs have a duty to involve themselves constructively in some way. In less than four months our biggest trading partner, Britain, could decide to leave the European Union. We need a verdict here sooner rather than later. There are many impediments ahead of a grand coalition which will make it really difficult to achieve. But it is worth finding out. The worry of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil about leaving Sinn Féin to be the biggest party of opposition appear to be more than a little hysterical and again insulting to the electorate. The Sinn Féin threat cannot be allowed hijack this debate about finding a durable and effective government. This unprecedented and extraordinary election result leaves us facing a period of uncertainty. There is no need to characterise it as chaos. But if delays are allowed to drag on and on without real commitment by the TDs old and new to find a solution, we could be looking at chaos. The Irish people deserve better than that. Their response at any subsequent election which results from such chaos would be very emphatic and wreak vengeance on",1,political,,,,,ireland
58,The Irish Times,28/12/2007,"A slowdown, not a shutdown","Business this Year/Overview: The next 12 months will be a year in which it will be best to avoid living dangerously, writes Paul Tansey, Economics Editor The party's over. Time has been called on the economic boom and the year ahead will be marked by a slowing rate of economic growth. The deceleration in the pace of activity growth has been triggered by a steep downturn in housebuilding and this is set to continue through 2008. Other areas of the economy should perform quite credibly, while not attaining the heights reached during the boom years. The economy is facing a growth slowdown, not a shutdown.   While the direction in which the economy will move in the next 12 months is clear enough, the pace at which economic growth decelerates remains open to question. The future is always uncertain, but visibility for the year ahead is particularly poor. In part, this reflects the continuing international banking crisis, initiated by over-exuberant US lending to subprime mortgage borrowers. In part, it stems from the speed of the slowdown in the domestic economy in the second half of 2007. The national economy performed strongly through the first half of 2007, with consumer spending and exports both exhibiting particularly eye-catching growth. However, the shape of things to come became apparent in the third quarter of the year. While exports continued to sparkle, the volume of capital investment in the third quarter registered a fall of 7.5 per cent on investment spending in the third quarter of 2006. A decline of 3.8 per cent in construction was the proximate cause of the contraction in capital spending, though there was evidence also of a weakening in plant and machinery investment. This downturn in investment is likely to have accelerated in the final quarter of 2007 and will carry through into 2008. Housebuilding is the principal component of fixed investment spending. In 2006, it accounted for half of all fixed investment and for over 15 per cent of Gross National Product (GNP). Thus, where housing goes, investment follows. However, houses are not built in a day. Most of the houses completed in 2008 will have commenced construction in 2007. And, suddenly, last summer, housing starts fell off the radar. Housing completions achieved an all-time peak at 88,000 in 2006. Recent forecasts from both the Department of Finance and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) estimate that completions in 2007 will be in the region of 75,000, falling to 55,000 in 2008. These estimates have informed their forecasts for total fixed investment next year. The Department of Finance, in Budget 2008, forecast a 1.6 per cent fall in the volume of gross fixed investment next year with the ESRI anticipating a larger 3.7 per cent volume fall in capital spending during 2008. In both cases, the negative signs on fixed investment next year act to drag down the national growth rate for 2008. The Department of Finance is forecasting that real GNP will advance by 2.8 per cent in the year ahead, with the ESRI projecting an increase of 2.3 per cent. However, both forecasts may still be overestimating housing output next year. Prior to the Budget, the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) was predicting that 25,000 houses would be completed in the first half of 2008. In the absence of any budgetary stimulation, the CIF anticipated that housing completions might reach just 45,000 in 2008. Should the excise duty changes in the budget fail to stimulate the sector and CIF projections prove accurate, then this would clip well over a full percentage point off forecast national growth rates for 2008. While 45,000 housing completions would represent a halving of housing output on the peak year of 2006, this would not mark a national disaster. Annual housing output had climbed to unsustainable levels, driven upwards not only by rates of new household formation but by speculative demand from personal investors. Completions increased from less than 34,000 in 1996 to 88,000 a decade later. With investor interest waning, a steep reduction in output is required to lend stability to both future output and prices in the housing market. In economic terms, a short, sharp shock is infinitely preferable to a long, drawn-out deterioration in housing output. Sour medicine is best taken quickly. House prices also softened significantly as the second half of 2007 progressed. Towards the end of the year, the ESRI held by its earlier forecast that house prices in December 2007 would be 15 per cent lower than a year earlier. Since the ESRI had previously estimated that prices were overvalued to the tune of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, such a price fall would effectively eliminate overvaluation. In consequence, it forecast that house prices would stabilise in the course of 2008. Once house prices are perceived by the public to have bottomed out, transactions volumes will pick up and the housing market will begin to return to health. THE ATTENTION devoted to housing overstresses its importance in the national economy. A shrinking housing sector will account for just 12 per cent of GNP next year whereas personal consumer spending comprises almost 58 per cent of GNP. Thus, trends in pay and prices, incomes and personal spending, employment and unemployment are of much greater moment to most households than housing completions. Forecasts indicate that non-farm wages increased by some 5.5 per cent during 2007. The annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, increased by 4.9 per cent in the first 11 months of 2007, but this includes sizeable increases in mortgage interest payments. Average prices increased by an estimated 2.9 per cent in 2007 when mortgage interest is excluded. Nonetheless, pay growth did not outdistance price rises by a sufficient margin to explain the forecast 7 per cent increase in consumer spending volumes during 2007. Three other factors provided added impetus to consumer purchasing volumes over the past year. First, the 2007 pre-election budget put more money in everybody's pockets, from top-rate taxpayers to social welfare recipients. Second, employment increased by more than 60,000 or by some 3 per cent. Third, and most important, payouts from Special Savings Incentive Accounts (SSIAs) released some EUR 16 billion to consumers in the 12 months to May 2007, with most of the cash arriving this year. These special factors, which turbo-charged consumer spending in 2007, will not be repeated next year. The SSIAs have left the stage. The Government was decidedly less generous in the 2008 Budget and employment is likely to grow by around 1 per cent at best in the year ahead. With a weaker economic climate and a looser labour market, average pay growth in 2008 is unlikely to match this year's increases. Pay rises are set to range between 4 per cent and 4.5 per cent with average consumer prices increasing by between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent in the year ahead, depending on trends in European Central Bank (ECB) interest rates. Budgetary changes affecting the incomes of those at work have provided indexation but little more. As a result, the real disposable incomes of those at work are unlikely to show much more than a 1 per cent advance in the year ahead. This implies that the average living standards of those at work will edge ahead during 2008, but the corks will be kept in the champagne bottles. Even where the 6 per cent to 7 per cent budgetary increases in income transfer payments and a 1 per cent addition to the numbers at work are factored in, it is difficult to envisage aggregate real disposable incomes growing by more than 2.5 per cent during 2008. Allowing that consumers were conservative in the management of their SSIA payouts, a portion of SSIA spending may be carried forward into 2008. Unless there is a benchmarking bonanza, real consumer spending should rise by some 3 per cent next year. At this time, the outlook for the year ahead is more uncertain than for many years past. In times of uncertainty, caution is usually the best policy. Above all, 2008 is not a year for living dangerously.  ",1,debt,,,,,usa
59,The Irish Times,06/04/2012,A straight and narrow road to recovery,"INTERVIEW:THERE S A GAP on the wall over Michael Noonan s left shoulder in the Minister s conference room at the Department of Finance for his photograph where he will join the rest of the State s finance ministers since 1919 in the gallery of portraits. Noonan s tenure in Merrion Street is likely to be judged on the success in recouping some of a bank bailout bill of EUR 64 billion, narrowing the EUR 19 billion gap in the public finances and setting the economy on a course to recovery. Even after austerity measures of EUR 21 billion since 2008 and a further EUR 12.4 billion earmarked for the next four years, the Minister is being told that he must go further. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the budgetary watchdog, said this week he ought to apply a further EUR 2.8 billion of measures up to 2015, including EUR 400 million this year. They said the Government s forecast for growth was on the high side given the uncertain outlook for our trading partners. Noonan says it is disappointing that growth targets won t be met but, based on nominal growth , the budget deficit target of 8.6 per cent of GDP will be reached this year.  We will see what will happen next year. I can t predict yet but we will be doing our figures in April again, said the Minister. Noonan believes the measures introduced in Europe to stem the debt crisis have created stability and that US growth is reasonably strong again. It seems to me that our growth rates in the second half of the year could be better than in the first half of the year, he said. Noonan believes that reducing the deficit to below 3 per cent by 2015 is still reasonable, but also accepts that austerity is not the be all and end all. Stimulating domestic demand, which he admits is somewhat flat , is essential to economic recovery. He points to the one-third share of the proceeds from the sale of state assets to be used for investment and funding and the European Investment Bank as two ways to breathe life into the domestic economy. The Government was looking at other areas to help boost activity, he said, and he will be looking at the demand side of the economy in preparations for the 2013 budget. Before that, the Government has the referendum on the EU fiscal treaty, which is designed to put manners on how governments set budgets. Unlike previous referendums on EU treaties, Noonan says the balance of uncertainty lies on the no side: If you vote yes, you know what you are voting for if you vote no, you are taking a jump in the dark.  A yes vote would ensure continued stability, he says, and guarantee Ireland could tap Europe s permanent ESM bailout fund. If we were ever in a situation where we needed funds from Europe again, shouldn t we position ourselves so that we can access them? he said. Noonan said the Government was making no links between a yes vote on the treaty and EU agreement on a deal on bank debt. Negotiations on finding a way to reduce the long-term annual costs of the bailouts of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide tied to further repairs to the State-controlled banks is keeping Noonan busy. THE NEXT THREE weeks will be dominated by officials making final touches to a draft paper yet to be agreed by the Government and the troika of the EU Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The paper must be ready for the troika s next review of the bailout programme in the second half of this month. Noonan said he hasn t seen the paper yet.  We will be examining every line of it, he said. Unless it benefits us, we have no interest in it.  Once the Government and troika agree on the draft paper, it will go for political approval. The Minister doesn t know where the suggestion that this could happen by mid-May at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers came from. Noonan says ECB agreement on last week s settlement of a EUR 3.1 billion cash payment for this year s instalment on the Anglo/Irish Nationwide promissory notes with a 13-year Government bond opens the door for a deal on the remaining payments.  I don t know would you could call that a breakthrough or not, but certainly it is a change in the principle position that the promissory note was untouchable. We can see now that it is not untouchable, he said. To avoid a EUR 3.1 billion cash payout hitting the exchequer s balance sheet, the Government instead issued a 2025 bond to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, the former Anglo Irish Bank that holds the promissory notes. A deal was reached that involved IBRC repo-ing the bond with Bank of Ireland in a swap for cash. IBRC would then use the cash to pay down the bank s emergency loans from the Central Bank, while Bank of Ireland would in turn repo the bond with the European Central Bank for cash. The plan hit a snare when it was deemed that Bank of Ireland required shareholder approval at a vote next month. In the interim, Noonan directed the National Asset Management Agency to complete the swap deal with IBRC. Noonan said Nama was providing bridging finance while the bank ballots shareholders. (The State owns 15 per cent and will abstain as a related party , the reason for the shareholder vote in the first place.) The Minister said the ECB had given its blessing when he first told the Dáil on the night of Wednesday, March 21st that the EUR 3.1 billion cash payment could be settled with a Government bond. But the plan could not be announced until details of the repo deal with Bank of Ireland was in place due to legal constraints on shareholder approval.  It wasn t that there was this big negotiation going on with the ECB that had been done and dusted the previous week, said Noonan. It was that we wanted to make sure that we didn t do anything in our talks with Bank of Ireland which took away the rights of shareholders which are, as you know, enshrined in law.  The Minister says officials had at one stage thought it might be possible to conclude the repo transaction with AIB, which is 99.8 per cent owned by the State. But the ECB expressed a clear preference for a bank that wasn t in State control. But I mean if we had done it with Deutsche Bank, they would have been equally happy, he said. Noonan says there was a coalition of interests between the Government and the ECB to find a way to reduce the costs associated with the promissory note and to get IBRC off the large-scale emergency borrowings from the Irish Central Bank. The Minister said an arrangement around changes to the promissory notes could be used to do other things in the banks as well . The removal of the loss-making tracker mortgage books from AIB and Irish Life Permanent was on the table as well . Improving the balance sheets of the two banks, which are virtually State-owned, would make a restructuring of the banks more malleable , he said. The Government has injected EUR 20.8 billion into AIB and will have pumped EUR 4 billion into Irish Life Permanent by the end of June once the sale of Irish Life to the State has been completed. Cleansing the banks of their trackers would, like changes to the promissory notes, help reduce the State s debts as it would make the banks attractive to investors, allowing the State to sell down its stakes in each, he said.  It is all tied in, and tidying up the balance sheets along the lines that has been signalled . . . would enhance the value of the banks and position them for selling part initially, but maybe selling all subsequently, said the Minister.  Our policy position is that we have no interest in running State banks in the long term. We would like to get them back into private hands but we will only do that when we can take the taxpayers value back out.  Tapping the EFSF bailout fund as part of this restructuring shouldn t be interpreted as a second bailout by the State, he says. The Government guarantee of 2008 from which all the debt ran predated the State s bailout.  What I am trying to do is to have a different solution for a pre-bailout piece of policy formation, he said. I don t think it is fair to say that it s a second bailout when the thing that we are trying to fix predated the bailout.  Noonan says there was political panic at the time of the EU-IMF bailout in 2010 and the last government was all over the place during that period. I am not surprised that the best deals weren t made and the bits that should have been included weren t, he said. He is working on a strategy to extract the best return on the EUR 64 billion of State cash that will be injected into the banks but doesn t yet know how much it would recover. The so-called placing agreements with the banks through which the State recapitalised the lenders last year blocks them paying bonuses to bankers. The Minister, however, has left the door open in the relationship framework agreements published last week governing the arm s-length relationship between the State and the banks that will enable them to incentivise senior bankers to make their lenders profitable. No agreement has been reached with any banker, but Noonan wants the measures in place so they could be approved by the troika.  They [the bankers] can only cash in at the same time the State cashes in, is the way I would envisage it, and it would be very limited to very key people, he says. Noonan says his call last year for all bank directors in situ on the night of the guarantee in 2008 to step down to renew the boards has become a more refined approach since Bank of Ireland has avoided State control.  If the shareholders who came in and invested in Bank of Ireland wanted particular directors, it is more their call than ours, he said. Regardless, the Central Bank is carrying out fitness for office tests on current directors in place at the time of the crisis, he notes. He points out that, of 64 bank directors in place at the time of the guarantee, just four remain. On the customer side at the banks, Noonan says the proposed personal insolvency legislation, which paves the way for the writedown of mortgage debt in out-of-court settlements, was only part of a set of solutions to tackle the heavy burden of personal debt. The Bill is still being drafted before publication by the end of this month, he says, but he feels it has got the balance right , despite bankers concerns that a cap of EUR 3 million debt on non-judicial mortgage write-off deals goes too far. While the scale of mortgage arrears is increasing, Noonan says the numbers actually slipping into arrears have bottomed out .  We are not quite there yet but we are close enough to knowing the actual number of households that are in arrears, he said. SHORTLY BEFORE HIS first anniversary in one of government s busiest portfolios, the Minister s wife Florence, who had lived with Alzheimer s for more than a decade, died. In recent years, the burden on the family had eased as his wife had been cared by professionals in a nursing home, he said. He visited his wife every day he was at home in Limerick. It was very difficult when the family were caring for Florence at home, he said. Had Fine Gael won the election in 2007 and the Taoiseach offered him the Finance job, he would not have been able to accept due to his commitments to his family. The Minister said that he had forgotten he held German government bonds as a personal investment until he read about them in an article in The Irish Times on the register of TDs interests last year. He sold them straight away, making a return of 11 per cent, he said.  In the excitement of being appointed minister I forgot I had them, he said. Noonan s work now in Finance is as busy as his time as Minister for Justice in the 1980s.  There was an IRA campaign and extraordinary stuff going on then. It was very time-consuming. We worked into the night, which is similar now, he said. His stint as Minister for Health in the 1990s was at a time of economic prosperity when money could be thrown at problems, a far cry from the situation the country finds itself in now. Solving problems with very little resources is a far more creative activity, and far more interesting as well, said Noonan.  It is doing a far better job for the economy because the fixes that are being made now are radical and they will work.  IN HIS OWN WORDS . . . ON RESOLVING THE MORTGAGE CRISIS You cannot have so many citizens with a burden of debt that keeps them out of the economy. We can t have so many talented people not participating in the economy for regeneration. ON THE BLAME GAME There is looking back by people who are looking for people to blame, which is grand, but is a futile exercise. Then there is looking back by people who want to rewrite history to justify positions, which is equally futile. ON THE CAMPAIGN FOR A YES VOTE ON THE EU FISCAL TREATY We have to campaign very strongly. My experience of referenda is that people will vote No unless they know exactly what they are voting for. ON THE HOUSEHOLD CHARGE I don t think there is evidence to say that there was a widespread refusal to pay the charge. It is a fact that people didn t pay the charge before the deadline, but there are a lot of reasons for that. ON IRELAND S DEBT BURDEN If you never had banking debt, the State debt is very significant as well. There is a kind of fallacy around that it wasn t the State at all, it was the banks and, if it wasn t for the bank guarantee, we would be in great shape. We wouldn t. About 20 per cent of the imposition is due to the banks. An awful lot of it is due to the mismanagement of the country and the budget deficits that we were running. THE GOVERNMENT S GRAND PLAN At the end of the day, it is not about banks or statistics; the Republic is about the people of Ireland and the bottom line in our agenda is that Ireland is a happy place to live and rear a family, that you will own your own home, you will have a job and that you will have a decent living standard. They are the objectives really everything else is ways and means. ON WHETHER THE ECB BOUNCED IRELAND INTO A BAILOUT It was the inadequacies and stupidities of the previous government that landed us in the programme. It is grand to be blaming someone else.",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
60,Irish Independent,05/04/2012,A strong fiscal framework will be essential for future stability,"This week, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council published its second Fiscal Assessment Report. The council was established on an interim basis last July, with a mandate to assess -- and comment publicly on -- the Government's macroeconomic forecasts, budgetary projections and fiscal stance.The reports are the primary vehicle for these public assessments.  The council will also be tasked with assessing compliance with budgetary rules that will be introduced as part of the upcoming Fiscal Responsibility Bill. This bill will establish the council as an independent body on a statutory basis.  Its primary role is to act as a ""fiscal watchdog"" for the long haul -- long after the Troika has completed its support programme. Provided that it can ensure its independence, technical competence and public visibility, the council should help avoid a repeat of the hidden budgetary imbalances that contributed to such devastating vulnerabilities in the past.  As outlined in the report, Ireland achieved its fiscal commitments under the EU/IMF programme and Excessive Deficit Procedure in 2011. This includes an underlying deficit of roughly 10pc of GDP, below the programme ceiling of 10.6pc.  The deterioration in growth prospects since Budget 2012 will increase the challenge of meeting the 8.6pc deficit target for this year. However, given the continuing fragility of creditworthiness, it will be important that, if necessary, measures are taken to ensure that this 8.6pc target is achieved.  More generally, the report discusses the unusual uncertainty that surrounds growth prospects for the post-bubble Irish economy, and recommends increased use of risk and scenario analysis in budgetary planning and documentation.  As in any situation where there is a recession accompanied by a cut off of access to market funding, the Government faces a challenging and unenviable dilemma in determining what is the best fiscal approach to follow. On the one hand, more fiscal adjustment reduces demand and slows the recovery. With so many households and businesses struggling in the recession, even weaker domestic demand is no one's first choice.  But, on the other hand, slower adjustment requires more financing -- from the troika or elsewhere -- to plug the budgetary hole and leads to the debt expanding even more. A larger overhang of debt can undermine debt sustainability and creditworthiness with both potential market and official funders.Beyond certain levels, high debt burdens tend themselves to slow growth. And passing on the debts incurred today to younger generations, who also face costs associated with an ageing population, raises serious issues of fairness.  In the first report (October 2011), while accepting that the planned government deficit targets were ""within the range of appropriate actions"", the council concluded that there was a strong case for reducing the medium-term deficit target for 2015 from 3pc (the Government'sfigure) to 1pc of GDP. Work undertaken by the council indicated that this would have required additional adjustment measures amounting to EUR4bn over the period from 2012 to 2015.  The reasons for the more ambitious suggested adjustment path included the significant vulnerability of both Ireland's market and official creditworthiness at the time.The future prospects for the eurozone were becoming increasingly unclear, and Ireland needed to avoid being put on a list with Greece of countries that would only receive support with an effective enforced default and substantially harsher conditions.  Developments have been mixed since October. Irish short-term growth prospects have weakened. More positively, there has been some improvement in our underlying creditworthiness, although it is too early to tell how durable this will prove to be. Moreover, since the Government stuck to its original deficit target for 2012 (the council's October report had suggested somewhat greater adjustment), meeting the2015 deficit of 1pc indicated by the council would require an even greater effort to make up the ground in 2013-15.  After balancing the different elements, the just-issued report assesses that the cumulative amount of adjustment for 2013-2015 set out in the October report -- EUR11.4bn, compared with the Government's plan of EUR8.6bn -- is still appropriate. Simulations benchmarked on Budget 2012 now indicate this would result in a deficit of 1.7pc of GDP in 2015.  With this adjustment path, the primary balance (ie, the balance excluding interest costs) would likely show a surplus of around 4pc of GDP based on the Government's growth forecasts. This would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path, helping to underpin renewed creditworthiness, intergenerational fairness and growth.  One concern addressed in the report and that has been raised in the public debate is the risk of a ""chasing-your-tail effect"", whereby negative growth surprises force larger budgetary adjustments that lead to yet lower growth.  Our analysis does not support the fear that, for Ireland, fiscal adjustment is actually self-defeating. For Ireland, budgetary adjustments have, in fact, ended up reducing the deficit.  Taking account of the fragility of creditworthiness, adherence to the deficit targets agreed under the EU/IMF programme has to take precedence. This is why the current report urges adherence to the government target of a deficit of 8.6pc of GDP for 2012.  However, in a less constrained world -- when programme constraints and creditworthiness requirements are less pressing -- it is important to pursue policies that help retain flexibility while preserving fiscal credibility. One approach outlined in the report is for the Government to set out in advance what the fiscal response will be to negative growth shocks.  This is consistent with the approach described above for 2013-2015, whereby nominal adjustment targets would be set and adhered to, but the actual deficit as a share of GDP would have some flexibility to adjust based on actual growth outcomes.  Ireland's crisis-resolution strategy of phased adjustment with external support is slowly beginning to work.  While growth prospects are uncertain, the economy, led by its export sectors, is better positioned than other crisis-affected countries for a return to steady growth as a world recovery begins to take hold.Creditworthiness is gradually returning.  Being so heavily dependent on international trade and investment, it will help if Ireland can get through the crisis with a reputation as astable place to invest and do business -- even when hit by massively disruptive shocks.  A strong fiscal framework can contribute to the recovery while helping to ensure future budgetary and financial stability. The credibility associated with such a framework can actually allow more flexibility in the use of fiscal demand management in responding to adverse shocks.  The future shape of Ireland's fiscal institutions will be heavily debated in the weeks before the May 31 referendum on the Fiscal Treaty. Whatever the outcome of the vote, we hope that one positive inheritance from the crisis will be a set of financial and fiscal institutions designed to prevent accumulated vulnerabilities from ever doing such damage again.

61,The Irish Times,30/12/2014,A strong performance; Economy in 2014,"The performance of the economy in 2014 surpassed the expectations of many, not least those of Minister for Finance Michael Noonan. When presenting the 2014 budget, he forecast a modest 2 per cent rate of GDP growth. Now Ireland, as Europe's fastest-growing economy this year, is set to achieve a growth rate closer to 5 per cent. The pace of economic recovery has been stronger and faster than the Government had first estimated. The Coalition's problem, however, is that too few people have felt in their pockets the benefits of the economic turnaround. A rising tide has failed, as yet, to lift all boats, despite the many encouraging economic indicators - rapid growth, falling unemployment, increased consumer confidence and improved public finances.  At the same time, a good year for the economy has been a bad one - politically - for the Government. Its early success in exiting the EU-IMF bailout programme and regaining greater economic sovereignty - where, as Mr Noonan noted, Ireland was ""handed back her own purse"" - was not maintained. The Government hailed the end of austerity too soon. And in framing the Budget, it went on to defy the expert advice of many, including the Central Bank, Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, European Commission and Economic and Social Research Institute. All these institutions had favoured a greater (EUR 2 billion) fiscal adjustment, partly as a cushion against unexpected shocks and partly through a concern at Ireland's high overall level of public debt. Instead, the Government delivered a modest EUR 1 billion stimulus via tax cuts and spending increases. Public finances  Nevertheless, the strong economic recovery has helped to transform the state of the public finances. Employment increased, rising by 1.5 per cent (27,700) on an annualised basis in the third quarter. And more people at work has meant larger than anticipated income tax receipts, while increased consumer spending has boosted VAT and excise duty returns. In November, the standardised rate of unemployment reached 10.7 per cent - below the euro area average and the 36th consecutive monthly decline. Lower unemployment has meant savings on welfare payments, which further helped to improve the fiscal balance. By November, tax receipts were EUR 1.1 billion ahead of target, with the 2014 budget deficit (general government balance) now forecast at 3.7 per cent of GDP, and well positioned to leave the EU's excessive deficit procedure in 2015. A year ago the yield - or interest rate - on Ireland's 10-year sovereign debt was 3.5 per cent. Since then the cost of Government borrowing has more than halved, dropping to under 1.3 per cent. The decline in yield has been helped by a number of positive developments: the economy's rapid recovery, the restoration of Ireland's public debt to investment grade status, and the sustained downward pressure on global interest rates which are now at historic lows. In addition, the Government secured agreement to refinance Ireland's IMF loans (EUR 18 billion) at lower rates, which will result in a significant saving in annual debt servicing costs.  The overall strong performance of the domestic economy occurred despite weak euro area activity. It expanded by 0.2 per cent in the third quarter, remaining close to entering recession for the third time in six years. The tourism industry had an impressive year, building on the success of The Gathering marketing campaign last year and raising visitor numbers by 9 per cent this year. The sector recorded strong growth in 2014, helped by the retention of the low 9 per cent VAT rate, with overseas earnings expanding by EUR 400 million, the biggest increase in a decade. A strong dollar and easier air transport access to Ireland have helped to boost the number of US visitors, with those from UK - who account for almost half of overseas tourists - and continental Europe also increasing.  Uncertainties As the year ends, some uncertainties and concerns remain to cloud the 2015 horizon. Throughout 2014, Ireland's corporate tax laws came under increasing external threat, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development advanced proposals for a major reform of international tax rules. In June, the European Commission announced a formal state aid investigation into Apple's Irish tax affairs. And in September, the Commission formed a ""preliminary view"" that Ireland had acted illegally, by giving Apple preferential tax treatment in 1991 and 2007. The Government responded to growing international pressure and criticism and acted in October to phase out the ""Double Irish"", a tax avoidance mechanism used by multinationals to minimise their tax bill. But with the UK going to the polls next May, and with British prime minister David Cameron, if re-elected, pledging to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership of the EU, and to submit these for public acceptance or rejection in a referendum, this adds one further uncertainty for Ireland in 2015.",1,fiscal,apple,,,,ireland

64,Irish Independent,03/07/2008,A true test of Cowen's mettle,"RUNNING repairs urgently required. The economic juggernaut has shuddered to a halt, cutting the Government's expected tax-take this year by at least EUR3 billion. The economy now faces its most severe correction in 20 years, butis probably in better shape to face the challenge than it was back then. Certainly that is Brian Cowen's contention.  Starting from tomorrow, if not sooner, tough decisions need to be made and sustained over the next two years if the economy and Government finances are to return to sustainable growth in 2010.  These are interesting times. Along with most other countries, this small, open economy of ours is taking a beating from global, interactive, negative influences such as soaring oil prices, a weak dollar, the international credit crisis and high eurozone inflation. In Ireland's case, as we are continually and depressingly reminded, these unpleasantries are aggravated by the collapse of the construction industry, with its consequent loss of jobs and revenue.  All this at a time of uncertainty about this country's place in Europe and on the eve of national pay talks which are already radiating tetchy vibes. However, social partnership is not about pay alone. The economic situation calls for a genuine partnership between all sectors to help us emerge undamaged and fit to compete with the strongest.  The Taoiseach has sensibly promised to borrow, close to the EU permitted limit, to make up this year's inevitable shortfall in orderto drive the National Development Plan forward. Excessive borrowing in the longer term would be disastrous.  However, we must wait to hear what other, hopefully more imaginative, measures the Cabinet may be about to bring forward.  The opposition's recommended prescription was summarised by Richard Bruton yesterday. First, Mr Cowen must admit his guilt; this to be followed by a ruthless slashing of public service waste, a reduction in the number of unnecessary junior ministers, abandonment of ministerial pay rises and continued investment in infrastructure.  Certainly public spending and the state of the services are central to our predicament. If we had the sort of five-star health and education services that ought to have been delivered through the billions spent in recent years, curbing the growth of public spending today might not present such a challenge.  The opposition's indignant accusation that the Government is guilty of ""blowing"" the benefits of the building boom years is somewhat weakened, in retrospect, by the parties' failure to attack, or even criticise Government economic policies during the run-up to last year's general election.  Nevertheless, people cannot understand where the money went, and are left with the feeling that a great opportunity was wasted.  Be that as it may, this is a time for action and creativity, not recrimination. Answering Eamon Gilmore's questions in the Dail yesterday concerning specific sad cases, the Taoiseach said frontline services would not suffer in a recession. This will not be easy. The puzzle he must solve is how to maintain services while delivering badly needed improvements in health, education and transportat a time when the public sector faces probable real increases in its budgets of 2pc or less.  It is hard to see how services will not suffer under the required budgetary regime.  This is not the end of the world. The imagination, enterprise and partnership that created an economy that has been the envy of Europe for years, together with sound fundamentals, can see the country through.  Even in the gloom there are hopeful signs that we can avoid the doom. A rather more encouraging report was largely ignored last week, perhaps because it didn't match the mood of the times. The Enterprise Ireland 2007 report told of Irish companies' remarkable performance, with exports exceeding an unprecedented EUR13.181bn.   Meanwhile current industrial output remains 30pc higher than in 2002. The Taoiseach tells us that our economic juggernaut, though slightly dented, will pass its NCT test. Now, as the designated driver, he has to show us that he and his team know how to steer it. ",0,,,,,,
65,The Irish Times,02/01/2016,A very different general election; The 2011 election was the most seismic in memory and it left a very changed political landscape for 2016,"We are facing into a very different general election in 2016, an election of 10 firsts the likes of which we have never experienced in the history of this State. This political judgment isn't lightly made, but, in order to state it boldly, it is necessary to position the 2016 contest in the context of national elections that came before. One way or another, I have been involved in covering 12 general elections since 1973. Looking back on them now, in the run-up to the 2016 campaign, they were all distinctive and different in their own right without rocking the political foundations of the State - as Pat Rabbitte was wont to say - in the way that the last one did. There was Liam Cosgrave's Fine Gael- Labour coalition with Brendan Corish in 1973 that was known as the ""Government of all the Talents"" because of the presence of Conor Cruise O'Brien, Justin Keating and Garret FitzGerald inside the Cabinet and people such as David Thornley outside. Jack Lynch won a historic majority of 20 seats for Fianna Fáil in 1977. There was Garret FitzGerald's victory over Charles Haughey to form a minority government in 1981 after Haughey's first election as Fianna Fáil leader. This was followed by Haughey's second election in February, 1982, the minority government of the Tony Gregory deal, Gubu and the telephone-tapping scandal. Then, in the third general election in 18 months, the five-year FitzGerald-Dick Spring coalition was elected with a comfortable majority in November, 1982. Next came Haughey's 1987 minority government supported by Fine Gael's ""Tallaght strategy"" under Alan Dukes. The first Fianna Fáil coalition government was formed in 1989 when Haughey compromised on what was considered ""a core value"" of his party to enter government with Des O'Malley's Progressive Democrats. The first Fianna Fáil-Labour coalition came in 1992 when Dick Spring entered government with Albert Reynolds. (The first change of government in the history of the State without a general election came in 1994 with the formation of the Fine Gael-Labour/Democratic Left coalition). Then came the Bertie Ahern coalitions from 1997 (Fianna Fáil and the PDs); 2002 (Fianna Fáil and the PDs) and 2007, of course, when the first three-party Fianna Fáil coalition was formed with the PDs and the Green Party entering government for the first time. There was also the security back-up of Jackie Healy-Rea, Michael Lowry, Finian McGrath and Beverley Cooper-Flynn on the side. That is just a factual documentation of the changes in traditional voting patterns, loyalties and political influences over more than 40 years. However, it does contextualise where we are now. I can confidently say, without fear of contradiction, that the last general election in 2011 produced the most seismic shift in politics ever seen by the living generations of voters. It is arguable that it is the biggest change in the party political system that ever happened in this State.  Stephen Collins, political editor of The Irish Times, described the 2011 election in his introduction to the Irish Times Nealon's Guide as ""one of the great transformational contests in Irish political history. Fianna Fáil, the party that has dominated the State for almost 80 years, lost three- quarters of its Dáil seats in an unprecedented rout that changed the face of Irish politics."" 2011 election  The result of the 2011 election was: Fianna Fáil lost 58 seats, going from 78 to 20, moving from the largest to become the third party; Fine Gael gained 25, going on to win 76 seats and become the largest party for the first time; The Labour Party won 17 extra seats, to become the second-largest party for the first time in its history with 37 TDs; The Green Party lost all of its seats to have no presence in the Dáil; Sinn Féin gained 10 to win 14 seats, its greatest number of Dáil seats to date; United Left Alliance won five seats; There were 14 Independents elected. What happened last time would normally be the baseline on which the 2016 general election would be fought. Not this time. With political developments since 2011, the state of the parties going into the 2016 election is: Fine Gael 68 (including Ceann Comhairle, excluding the recent Seán Conlon resignation in Cavan-Monaghan and the movement to Independents) Labour Party 33 Fianna Fáil 21 Sinn Féin 14 Anti-Austerity Alliance/People Before Profit 4 Renua Ireland 3 Social Democrats 3 Workers and Unemployed Group 1 Independents 19 Coming back to the point. This is this going to be a very different general election to all those that came before, both politically and journalistically. It is going to be one of the strangest, most fascinating and different general elections where stability in government will be the main issue in a majority of voters' minds after the uncertainty that has engulfed their personal and financial lives in the wake of the crash and the loss of economic sovereignty in the years of the European bailout. A big threat to it is that the Fine Gael and the Labour Party would squander those sacrifices with auction politics in 2016. And, the old journalistic rules must apply. It is going to be a challenging - indeed, a difficult and different general election - for The Irish Times to cover in a fair, balanced, proportionate and independent way in the newspaper and, for the first time seriously, across all digital platforms.  This is the first general election in living memory where the election isn't just about the old conventional 2½-party system. The traditional Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Party options have been the key to changing and forming governments for decades. They were the key as recently as the last general election in 2011. (As an aside, John A Costello was taoiseach of a 5½-party government in 1948 comprising Fine Gael, Labour, National Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and Independents. Interestingly, in an illustration of how history can repeat itself, the campaign theme then was Fianna Fáil versus chaos.) It is the first general election where Fianna Fáil is not the dominant party and even one of its own, former minister Noel Dempsey, stated in an interview on RTÉ recently that the toxicity hadn't gone away. Its new director of elections, Billy Kelleher, has set a target of between 35 and 40 seats for the party as a good result.  It is the first general election where Fine Gael and the Labour Party can establish and verify that they are leaving the country in a demonstrably better state than when they came into government.  It is the first general election with a compulsory female gender quota of 30 per cent of candidates, with the threat of parties losing State funding. Some 134 of the 438 candidates selected/declared so far, at the time of writing, are women. This compares to 86 in 2011. There are 25 outgoing women TDs, the biggest number on record.  Big differences   It is the first election where Sinn Féin has established a real foothold in the Dáil.  It is the first election where there is a significant and visible ideological difference in economic policies, especially around the water charges, property tax and increased taxation on higher incomes. This makes the costing of the promises made in election manifestos a key issue. There are very substantial financial differences and policy implications between the agendas of the different parties. It is the first election where there are more Independents, new small parties like Renua Ireland and the Social Democrats, official and unofficial political alliances, parties and alliances with and without leaders than ever before.  And, politically and psychologically, this is the election heading into the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, where all existing parties and persuasions will want to stake their claim to some aspect, however dubious at the time, of the creation of this State. To make matters more complicated, the composition of the next Dáil has changed as well. There are 166 seats in the current Dáil requiring 84 TDs to form a majority Government. There will be 158 seats in the 32nd Dáil elected in 2016, requiring 80 for an outright majority. The number of constituencies has reduced from 43 to 40. There are historic geographical changes in key constituencies: the two Kerrys, two Donegals and two Tipperarys are gone. There are new constituencies such as Dublin Bay North and Dublin Bay South. All but 11 constituencies are changed. The key issue now, the most relevant going into the 2016 general election, is that there is no alternative taoiseach for the first time. You have Enda Kenny or chaos - a reproduction of the Fianna Fáil campaign slogan in 1948 that produced a five-party coalition.  As things stand, there is no democratic choice on offer. That is not good for voters. So, as of now, there is not the classic taoiseach balanced by the alternative aspiring taoiseach for the first time in the history of the State. Enda Kenny may be stiff, wooden and uncomfortable on television, but, to his great credit, he chaired a government that succeeded in bringing Ireland out of its worst times, leaving Ministers to get on with it. If it weren't for someone as conservative as him coming out to propose the abortion legislation and the same-sex marriage referendum, it is unlikely they would have passed. Many people would wish that they didn't have to vote for Enda Kenny in the next election, but they will. Voters have no choice if they want stable government. And, to be absolutely fair to him, it is a big thing to be able to say that here is an outgoing taoiseach who is not besmirched by impropriety, digouts, moral or ethical questions.  Based on political instinct and successive opinion polls, Fine Gael will be the biggest party in the next Dáil. The danger is that it would assert this with arrogance during the campaign. It would do terrible damage to its profile if it went on a spending spree on promises, and there are signs of that in spin and stories in the news.  If 58 seats can change place for one party in one election, there is no reason to believe that that many seats coming from all quarters could not fly all over the place in the next. Not enough seats   Fine Gael and Labour will not have enough seats probably to return a two-party coalition. This is not all due to Government decisions in the most difficult times. A number of leading high-profile Labour figures are retiring and, in reality, they held personal as much as party seats: Ruairí  Quinn, Pat Rabbitte, Eamon Gilmore, for example. The very worst thing that the Tánaiste, Joan Burton, could do is to fight publicly with Fine Gael in the campaign and yet expect to get Fine Gael transfers. Its campaign strategy and the way that it asserts its differences should be agreed privately. And are we to take it for granted that, irrespective of any shortage of seats for a return of this Coalition, Fine Gael will bring Labour into the next government anyway? Just like Bertie Ahern did with the PDs? Has Fine Gael given Labour such a commitment and, if so, will a newly returned, smaller and younger parliamentary Labour party want to honour it? Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will have enough seats to form a stable majority government but, for historic reasons in 1916, the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, will not allow it to happen. There is a Fianna Fáil fear that if the two Civil War parties coalesce, the way is left clear for a left-wing government next time. That is old thinking in a different Ireland. So Fianna Fáil has excluded itself from power in the 2016 government with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin. That would seem to be an unwise and limiting policy.  Are there divisions among the outgoing 21 Fianna Fáil TDs about such a strategy? Would Fianna Fáil choose Sinn Féin over Fine Gael as its preferred partner? Would Sinn Féin form a government with Fianna Fáil or was that a strategic Gerry Adams flier? And if, as predicted by its director of elections, the honest and respected Billy Kelleher, Fianna Fáil wins 35 to 40 seats, who is to say what a new parliamentary party might decide about its future? Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin will probably not have the numbers, but Sinn Féin usually over-performs in polls and it will be a major advance if the party gets 20 seats. Will Gerry Adams take active steps to be part of the next government? How will Sinn Féin perform outside the working class? Is it attracting middle-class candidates for election whose parents haven't been IRA members or active supporters of the republican cause during the Troubles? Independents, new parties and alliances could be large, all added together, but they are neither a cohesive nor a reliable bargaining force this time. Looking at the last Ipsos/Irish Times opinion poll, where there was an interesting new question. Breaking down the composition of Others, such as Renua, Social Democrats and independent alliances, it would appear that there is an absence of a big enough cohort of TDs with whom the next government could negotiate comfortably. There were six PD TDs and six Green Party TD s which a government could do a deal and enter a working relationship with in earlier coalitions. It does not appear that any of the new parties or Independent alliances will produce such a neat negotiable force. All of these issues will be clarified for voters during the 2016 election. It would be no surprise if, as in Britain, there was a major swing to stability during the campaign and Independents of all hues were squeezed. 2016 election 10 things that will make it different  n1.

66,The Irish Times,01/02/2003,A Warning On The Economy,"Economic growth weakened significantly in the third quarter of last year, according to new figures from the Central Statistics Office. The figures are unusually difficult to interpret, because of the distorting impact of multinational profit repatriations. However a reasonable reading suggests that growth in most areas of economic activity slowed sharply towards the end of last year. 03020100079 There has long been debate about what growth measure best reflects the real state of the economy. Gross Domestic Product, which counts the total output of the economy, rose by 6.1 per cent in the first nine months of last year, greatly overstating growth. This compared to a 1.4 per cent rise for Gross National Product, which is calculated after the subtraction of profits repatriated from multinational operations here. The latter appears the more realistic measure of the growth in economic activity. There will be no improvement in the economy in the early part of this year. International conditions remain poor and the threat of war in Iraq is causing great uncertainty. The main challenge for policymakers is - as far as possible - to hold on to the economic gains of recent years and to try to ensure that the economy is best-placed to benefit when the international upturn arrives. With this in mind, there are some clear economic issues which the Government needs to address. First and foremost is the rate of inflation and the rising domestic costs which are damaging competitiveness. The Government has committed to tackling some of the important issues, through reforms in insurance, new measures to boost competition and active monitoring of price and inflation trends. However there is a need for a much greater urgency in pursuing this agenda. Indigenous industry is being badly squeezed - weakness was already evident in the latest CSO figures and the subsequent rise of the euro will have intensified competitive difficulties. If cost pressures cannot be reduced, then the price will be paid through rising unemployment. Many of these issues are being discussed in the talks on a new national agreement, which are still underway. Signing such an agreement would provide welcome stability. The 7 per cent pay increase over 18 months would represent a slowdown in wage growth, but in an environment of weak global inflation it will not of itself improve competitiveness. Meanwhile it is essential that the reforms promised in return for the expensive public sector pay benchmarking payments are delivered; if the aspirations of progress in this area are not turned into reality then the burden on the economy will be very significant. Overall, the latest figures from the CSO should cause the Government to sit up and take notice. If steps are not taken to restore our competitiveness, then the gains made in recent years will start slowly slipping away.",1,security,iraq wars,,,,iraq
67,The Irish Times,27/12/2011,A year of political upheaval,"THE SHATTERING of Fianna Fáil s hegemony in Irish political life has been the most striking feature of the past year but some of the key reasons for that the collapse of the banking and building sectors, falling living standards, rising unemployment and a failure to call those responsible to account continue to challenge the cohesion and capabilities of the Fine Gael/ Labour Party Government. Fianna Fáil s tumble from power was slow but spectacular, beginning with defeat in the local elections of 2009 and culminating in Brian Cowen s pre-election resignation and the subsequent loss of 58 Dáil seats. It was a long and soul-destroying road for a party that had dominated Irish politics for more than 80 years. Now, down to 20 Dáil seats, it is fighting for its very existence. It is under immense pressure from a Sinn Féin organisation that increased its representation from four to 14 TDs and had party leader Gerry Adams elected in Louth. There is some residual support for Fianna Fáil. This was evident during the presidential election campaign when Seán Gallagher became the party s unofficial standard-bearer and arising from a strong performance in the Dublin West byelection. Traditional voting reflexes can only be effectively exploited, however, if Micheál Martin can distance the party from its record of sleaze and political mismanagement. Fine Gael may have replaced Fianna Fáil as the dominant political force but its foundations are shallow and prone to subsidence. This was graphically displayed in the Dublin West by-election when its candidate came in fourth. The outcome was even worse in the presidential election when Gay Mitchell came a poor fifth. The Labour Party s ambition to become the largest Dáil party did not appeal to the electorate. In spite of that, it made significant progress and won 37 seats, its best ever performance. The party went on to secure the Presidency and the Dublin West byelection. Michael D Higgins became a popular President with more than a million votes, but it was an achievement that owed much to Sinn Féin s televised ambush of Seán Gallagher. Pressures posed by an overwhelming Dáil majority and financial cutbacks saw its byelection winner Patrick Nulty forfeit the party whip and join his colleague Willie Penrose and Fine Gael s Denis Naughten of Fine Gael in the dissidents enclosure. In spite of such distractions, the Government and Taoiseach Enda Kenny in particular enjoyed something of a honeymoon period on the diplomatic front. The first official visit to the State by a British monarch helped to lay the ghosts of old grievances and drew attention to the political progress being made in Northern Ireland through a power-sharing Executive dominated by the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin. People, Queen Elizabeth suggested, should bow to the past but not be bound by it. A hurried visit by President Obama of the United States added to the early summer feelgood atmosphere. But publication of the Cloyne report on clerical sexual abuse brought confrontation with the Vatican and a recasting of Ireland s relationship with the Holy See. Mr Kenny s ringing Dáil declaration that the laws of the State rather than canon law would henceforth apply to all such issues brought general public approval. Diplomatic differences eventually led to closure of the Vatican embassy, although the official reason given was costs. The incoming Government failed in its initial efforts to renegotiate the terms of the EU-IMF bailout. Then, almost as a sop, it was granted a reduction in interest repayments. Irish Ministers discovered how little influence they had in Europe because of past arrogance and their current, reduced circumstances. A blizzard of economic and fiscal uncertainty makes it difficult to plan ahead and threatens long-term austerity. Into that confused situation, the Government dropped a recovery plan and its first budget. The plan reflected original commitments agreed with the Troika and disappointed a great many in its ambition. It was a far cry from Fine Gael s five-point plan with its undertaking to create 100,000 jobs through a EUR 7 billion investment programme. Since then, estimates for growth have been revised downwards as exports slow and recession takes hold in Europe. At the same time, long-term unemployment is rising. The budget sought to keep taxes low and maintain the Croke Park agreement. It gave the impression of protecting the better-off at a time when nobody was being held to account for the disasters that overtook the banking, building and regulatory sectors. In those circumstances, it can only be regarded as extraordinary that Opposition parties have identified a new EUR 100 household tax as their main budgetary concern. Winning the general election may have been the easy part for the Government parties. Repairing the economy and underpinning it with innovation across all sectors while engaging in necessary political reforms will test their mettle. A constitutional convention will consider a range of matters in 2012. Top of the agenda will be reform of the electoral system, involving proportional representation and multi-seat constituencies. Parochialism and clientelism have rotted the notion of civic morality in political life, encouraging bias and dishonesty and damaging the national interest. In the current state of political, economic and social flux, the electorate is looking for strong leadership and a degree of certainty. In that context, a referendum to abolish the Seanad is almost a distraction, and risks defeat if reforms are not far-reaching. If those directly responsible for the economic crisis cannot be held to account under the law, they should at least be removed from their elevated, well-paid positions.",1,fiscal,taxes,,,,ireland
68,Irish Independent,01/02/2016,"A'living'subject; Economics is an exciting and dynamic subject that will give you a different perspective on how you view the world, writes teacher at Yeats College Shauna Roberts","Economics studies why people make choices; it forms the basis for governments to make decisions, companies to employ workers and for people to spend or not to spend. We can't always be definite in our study of human behaviour, because different people act in different ways, which is why economics is called a 'social science'. This means it studies the allocation of scarce resources that have alternative uses. Economics describes the factors that determine the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. Economics is all around us and is relevant to everyone's daily lives. It is a 'living' subject that is constantly changing. If you read the weekly newspaper or watch a current affairs programme on television, you are guaranteed to come across some economic issues that you may be asked about in your exam in June. Topical issues are vital in the economics exam and the A1 student is required to have knowledge of a range of topical and current economic issues outside of their textbook. Topics Leaving Cert Economics is divided into two categories: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics deals with how individuals decide what goods or services they are willing to buy or not to buy; and how firms try to reduce costs in order to maximise profits. Microeconomic topics Topic 1. Utility. Demand. Supply. Equilibrium. Elasticity Topic 2. Costs of production Topic 3. Market structures:. Perfect competition. Imperfect competition. Monopoly. Oligopoly Topic 4. Factors of production:. Land. Labour. Capital. Enterprise Macroeconomics is a study of how governments handle the economy as a whole, and how they decide on policies to achieve their goals. Macroeconomic topics Topic 1: Money and banking Topic 2: National income Topic 3: The Government in the economy Topic 4: International trade and the global economy Topic 5: Economic growth and development Topic 6: Economics of population Topic 7: Inflation Paper structure HIGHER AND ORDINARY LEVEL There are 400 marks in total available in the Economics exam and students have 2 hours and 30 minutes to complete it. SECTION A: Short questions - 100 marks: 25-30 minutes Students must answer six of the nine short questions asked. Questions 1-5 carry 16 marks while questions 6-9 carry 17 marks (therefore questions 6-9 need to be answered to maximise marks). Take 4-5 minutes per question. Questions are based on the entire course. SECTION B: Long questions - 300 marks: 1 hour 40 minutes Students must answer four of the eight questions asked. Each question carries 75 marks in total. Spend 25 minutes per question. Bullet point answers should be used and credit will be given for clear, precise answering and orderly presentation. Generally, there are three to four microeconomics questions and four to five macroeconomics questions. However, in recent years some questions have been mixed with different topics and have even contained a combination of micro and macro topics, so students cannot 'cherry pick' topics or try to take short cuts when preparing for their exam. Ideally, you will be left with 20 minutes at the end of the exam to look over your paper General tips . One-word answers are unacceptable: you must develop answers and detailed, relevant points are required for answers, even for short questions. A good rule of thumb is to fill the spaces provided for short questions. Example Q. Outline one way in which the return to the factor of production enterprise differs from the return to other factors of production. A. Can earn a loss. (correct, but this answer would only get you half marks) A. Can earn a loss; due to a fall in demand or an increase in costs of production, it is the only factor of production that can earn a negative return. . You must state and explain in every answer -even for short questions! Candidates need to show clear presentation of work:. State: heading in red pen. Explain: make sure explanation follows heading in black/blue pen. Marks may be allocated as 2 marks for heading and 3 marks for a clear explanation. . Use bullet point answers: don't write essay-style answers in Section B; bullet point answers should be used. This allows your explanation to be focused on one idea only and prevents you from duplicating points. Your answer should contain evidence of critical thinking and research. . Give examples: even if not asked for them, as this will strengthen your answer. If you are asked for examples, make sure you give them, as marks will be allocated for them. . Label all diagrams: they should be clear, large and properly labelled. Ensure each axis, each curve and each point is labelled. Double check this in your exam. . Practice explanations of the diagrams drawn: you must be able to explain every diagram you draw. . Link answers to the question asked: it is important to read the question carefully and relate your answer to this question, for instance, if Ireland is stated in the question, then focus on it. . Don't wander off the point: you will only be awarded marks for relevant information and your time is very precious in the exam so stick to the question you have been asked. For example, don't give deflation as an example for something and then continue to discuss deflation, when this is not what you have been asked to do. . Identify the outcome verb: make sure you do this before answering the question, so you know exactly what the verb means in the context of the question. Examples of outcome verbs are: analyse, compare, evaluate, discuss, outline, explain, define, state. Candidates often lose marks in the Economics exam by not correctly identifying and answering using the correct outcome verb in the question. . Keep up to date with relevant topical issues: this could include topics such as price levels, exchange rates, interest rates, unemployment figures, economic growth figures (e.g. GDP, GNP) government budgetary position, etc. If you decide to do a question on the paper that requires any current knowledge, it must be current and exact! You must use the latest figures and they must correlate with the marking scheme. . Timing! A main reason why students often fall down in the exam is due to incorrect time management. Make sure to match time spent on a question with the marks available for it. Also make sure that the detail of your answers is appropriate to the available marks. The general rule is that if there are 20 marks, give 4 points at 5 marks each (2 marks to state and 3 marks to explain for each point). This is usually true for 90% of the paper. However, there can always be exceptions, so always give an extra point for good luck, where possible. Section B: Sample questions and answers ELASTICITY Question: (i) Define the categories of price elasticity of demand (PED): elastic, inelastic and unit elastic. (ii)State three factors that affect PED and explain how each factor affects it. Answer: (i). Elastic: a good is relatively elastic when the proportionate/percentage change in quantity demanded of a good is greater than the proportionate/percentage change in the price of the good itself. Example: if price goes up by 10%, quantity demanded falls by 25%. . Inelastic: A good is relatively inelastic if the proportionate/percentage change in quantity demanded of a good is less than the proportionate/percentage change in the price of that good. Example: a 10% increase in price leads to a 3% fall in quantity demanded for the good . Unit elastic: A good is unitary elastic when the proportionate/percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good is equal to the proportionate/percentage change in the price of that good. Example: a 30% decrease in the price of the good itself leads to a 30% increase in the quantity demanded of the good: 30% 30% = 1 (ii). The availability of close substitutes:. The most important factor influencing the elasticity of a commodity. In general, the more substitutes that are available, the more elastic the demand tends to be. The closer the substitutability between goods, the more consumers will tend to switch from one substitute brand to another and thus the greater the PED will be. Example: if the price of Barry's tea went up by 5%, consumers may switch to Lyons Tea, a very close substitute. . If the commodity is a luxury or necessity:. PED for luxury goods will be relatively elastic because they are not essential, they are just things that we want and are a discretionary expenditure. PED for necessities will be relatively inelastic because they are essential goods in our everyday lives and we have no choice but to buy them, even when their price is increased. . The proportion of income that is spent on the commodity:. In general, the greater proportion of income that is spent on a good, the more elastic the demand for it is likely to be in response to a change in its own price. Example: a rise of 50% in the price of a bag of sugar is unlikely to have a significant effect on demand. Question A consumer/motorist buys 20 litres of diesel when the price is (EURO)1.60 per litre. When the price increases to (EURO)1.70 as a result of an increase in carbon tax the consumer buys 19 litres. (i) Calculate the consumer's price elasticity of demand (PED). (Show all your workings.) (ii)Is this demand for diesel price elastic or price inelastic? Outline the implication of your answer for government revenue. Answer (i) PED formula = .Q .P × P1 + P2 Q1 + Q2 = -1 0.10 × 1.60 + 1.70 20 + 19 = -0.846 = -0.85 (ii)Demand for petrol is inelastic The implication for government revenue: An increase in the price of petrol will yield an increase in revenue for the government, because the percentage increase in price will be greater than the percentage decrease in quantity demanded, resulting in increased tax revenue for the government. Question (i) A firm is considering a change to its product's price. It conducts market research which reveals that the price elasticity of demand (PED) for the product is -1.8. If the firm wishes to maximise total sales revenue, should it lower or raise the price of the product? Explain your answer. (ii)The market research also reveals income elasticity of demand (YED) for the product is -2.4. In the case of an economy which is expected to experience an economic boom over the next five years, what, if any, will be the likely impact on the demand for the product? Explain your answer. Answer (i) Price elasticity of demand (PED) = -1.8. This good is price elastic because its absolute PED value is greater than 1.. PED of -1.8 means that a 1% decrease in price will cause a 1.8% increase in quantity demanded. . To increase total revenue, the firm should reduce price.. This is because the percentage increase in quantity demanded will be greater than the percentage decrease in price. (ii)Income elasticity of demand (YED) = -2.4. This good is an inferior good because it has a negative YED value. It is also income elastic because it has an absolute value of greater than 1. This means that a 1% increase in income will cause a 2.4% decrease in quantity demanded. As incomes rise during an economic boom, quantity demanded should fall by a larger percentage that the percentage increase in income. MARKET STRUCTURES Question State and explain four assumptions underlying the theory of imperfect competition. Answer 1. There are many buyers in the industry:. Each buyer acts independently. Individual buyers are price takers as they cannot influence the market price of the goods by their own actions. 2. There is a large number of sellers in the industry:. Each seller acts independently. Sellers can set their own price, therefore they are called price makers. Therefore, each seller can influence the quantity sold by the price it charges for its output. 3. Product differentiation exists:. The goods supplied by the different firms are close substitutes but are not homogeneous. Therefore, firms use branding to distinguish their products from one another. 4. Freedom of entry and exit:. Firms already in the market cannot prevent other firms from entering the industry. Existing firms can close down if they wish. There are no barriers to entry or exit. Question Explain with the aid of a diagram, the long-run equilibrium of a firm in imperfect competition. . In imperfect competition, long-run equilibrium occurs where:. MC=MR and MC is rising (point E on diagram) = equilibrium output is at Q1. AR=AC (Point C on diagram) = equilibrium price is at P1 . SNP is not being earned as AR=AC (just earning normal profit). Cost of producing this output is at point C. The firm is not producing at the lowest point of the AC curve so it is wasting scarce resources. Question Outline the similarities of and the differences between imperfect competition and perfect competition. Answer. Similarities:. The firms in both of these markets earn normal profit where AR=AC in the long run. The firms in both these markets earn super normal profits where AR > AC in the short run. . Differences:. In perfect competition a firm will produce at the lowest point of the AC, indicating efficient use of resources. In imperfect competition a firm does not produce at the lowest point of the AC, indicating waste of scarce resources. . In perfect competition price is equal to MC. In imperfect competition price is greater than MC (indicating more of the good could be produced). . The perfectly competitive firm faces a horizontal demand curve. The imperfectly competitive firm faces a downward sloping demand curve. FACTORS OF PRODUCTION Question State and explain four factors which are currently affecting the supply of labour to the Irish economy. Note: you could similarly be asked 'what factors affect the supply of labour to an economy'. The theory is the exact same, just make it relative to the question being asked. In the above question, make sure to make the points relative to the Irish economy as this is the question being asked. Solution. Size and structure of population:. The greater a country's population and therefore the greater the number of citizens in the working age bracket, the greater the labour force that is available for . Ireland's population has increased with more citizens in the working age bracket, therefore, supply of labour has increased. . Wage levels in the economy:. Higher wage levels (in Ireland in recent years) are an incentive for people to increase the supply of labour. For some workers, as wage levels increase, they may prefer increased leisure and reduce their supply (backward bending supply curve). . Participation rate:. This is the number of people in the economy who are willing to work and depends on attitudes of society and homemakers, the state of the economy and welfare benefits. In Ireland the number of people willing to work in the 16-65 age bracket has increased. For example, more women are working, retired/unemployed people are willing to take up part time employment. . Rates of income tax in the economy:. If taxes fall, it may encourage an increase the supply of labour. If income taxes rise, this may encourage substitution of leisure for labour. In Ireland, income taxes have fallen in recent years, acting as an incentive for people to join the workforce. Question Explain, with the aid of a labelled diagram, the determination of equilibrium wage rate in a free market. Wage Rate S/C labour E WE D/C labour Qty. of labour Answer A free labour market . A free market is where there are no restrictions on the demand and supply of labour. The demand curve for labour will be the MRP of labour and slopes downwards. The supply curve will be upward sloping. The curves intersect at E. This point represents the equilibrium wage rate WE. If the wage rate was above WE, then excess supply would force the wage rate downwards. If the wage rate was below WE, then excess demand would force wages upwards. Question Outline the possible economic advantages and the possible economic disadvantages to the Irish economy of increasing the national minimum wage. Solution Advantages:. Increase standard of living: workers will receive higher income so their standard of living will rise. Increase aggregate spending: higher incomes will increase spending and the demand for goods/services will rise, resulting in more VAT receipts for the government. Encourage employment: the increase in wages will encourage people to join the workforce and reduce participation in the black economy. Impact on general wage levels: this increase in the minimum wage may indicate to employers that all wage levels should rise, resulting in a possible increase in the standard of living amongst the entire workforce, not just those on the minimum wage. Disadvantages:. Higher labour costs: resulting in an increased risk of business closure. Higher selling prices: with production costs rising, this may lead to higher prices of goods/services for consumers. Decreased demand for labour: the increase in wage rate may lead to a decrease in demand for labour and hence possible unemployment. Increased risk of re-location: If Irish wage levels rise higher than in other countries, this may result in firms considering relocating in countries outside Ireland. v Note: the economic effects of increasing the minimum wage is topical for the 2016 exam, as of 1 January, 2016 the minimum wage has increased from (EURO)8.65 to (EURO)9.15. There are arguments that it should be brought even higher. However, students also need to be able to discuss the economic effects of a decrease in the national minimum wage. MONEY AND BANKING Question (i) Explain, with the aid of an example, how it is possible for banks to create credit (ii) Explain four factors which could affect banks' ability to create credit (iii) Outline how the recent tightening in the availability of credit may affect:. The Irish housing market. The Irish motor industry. Inflation. Ireland's balance of payments. Answer (i) 1. Commercial banks accept cash deposits from their customers, for example (EURO)100, for safekeeping. 2. These banks know from experience that their customers will only demand back a small amount of these deposits in cash, for example 10%. 3. Therefore, they now have surplus cash with which to give loans, for example, (EURO)90. 4. The amount of loan they give is related to, but in excess of, their cash deposits and is based on their reserve ratio. Example 1. Mrs. X lodges (EURO)100 into the bank. 2. The bank knows that only 10% of total deposits are demanded in cash. 3. Therefore, it has enough cash to support total deposits of (EURO)1,000. The bank can create another (EURO)900 in deposits. It does this by giving out loans of (EURO)900. 4. Only 10% of its total deposits will be demanded in cash. So (EURO)100 cash is sufficient for this purpose. Increase in credit = increase in cash deposits x 1. Bank's reserve ratio Numerical example A person deposits (EURO)100 into a bank. The bank's reserve ratio is 10%. So the bank can create credit as follows: (EURO)100 x 1 = (EURO)1,000 [-(EURO)100 = (EURO) 900] 10% (ii) 1. Availability of cash deposits A bank can only give loans provided that it can attract cash deposits. If it attracts more deposits, then it can create more credit. As Irish interest rates are low, Irish banks may experience difficulty in attracting deposits, as customers seek better returns elsewhere. 2. Customers' demands for cash The bank must keep sufficient cash to be able to meet the demands of its customers. If people pay more of their bills with cash then their demand for cash will increase and this will reduce the ability of the banks to create credit. Commercial banks must follow the guidelines and regulations of the ECB on changing the required capital ratios (the amount of capital on the bank's balance sheet as a proportion of its loans) and the value of liquid assets it must keep. The ECB can also change the reserve requirement. All of this impacts on the bank's ability to create credit. 4. Demand for loans by customers A bank is limited in the amount of loans it creates by the demand for loans. In times of economic uncertainty, businesses are not likely to invest and individual customers are unlikely to borrow if they are worried about their future income. . Note: you could similarly be asked, more specifically, about factors which limit the ability of banks to create credit or factors which increase the ability of banks to create credit. You can use the same general points as above but make sure to make them specific and relative to the question asked! (iii). The Irish housing market: Decreased demand for housing The Central Bank of Ireland's new mortgage rules state that buyers must have 20% of a deposit regardless of the cost of the house (with the exception of first-time buyers who need a deposit of 10% to borrow anything up to (EURO)220,000) and that lenders must cap the size of mortgages to 3.5 times income. This may reduce the demand for housing, leading to weaker house price growth. Falling construction activity Tighter mortgage constraints may result in a decrease in the construction of houses, due to lack of demand. Decrease in rental accommodation New mortgage rules from the Central Bank of Ireland also state that those buying a house in order to let it out to tenants are obliged to give a 30% deposit before their mortgage will be approved. This may contribute further to the shortage of rental accommodation available in cities and surrounding areas. . The Irish motor industry: Decreased demand for cars It is more difficult for customers to avail of credit in order to purchase cars, which has resulted in a fall in the demand for both new and second-hand cars. Increased redundancies With less demand for cars the numbers of people employed in the sale of cars has declined. Business closures Many small independent car dealerships cannot survive due to the inability to get credit, the inability to pay suppliers and therefore are forced to close. Inflation will decrease The supply of credit will fall causing a decrease in the spending power of individuals. This fall will lead to a reduction in demand-pull inflation. Deflation The price of goods and services will fall due to falling demand and costs of production. . Ireland's balance of payments: Imports decrease If there is a reduction in the demand for goods and services, then we can assume that there will be an automatic fall in the demand for imports. Exports decrease Businesses will not be able to avail of credit in order to expand. This fall in investment may lead to a decrease in exports. A credit crunch on international markets may reduce aggregate demand resulting in reduced demand for goods produced in Ireland on export markets. Question Discuss the possible economic effects of low interest rates for the Irish economy. Answer. Borrowing encouraged: borrowing would be less expensive, resulting in lower loan repayments. This leads to increased spending power and a higher standard of living. . Savings discouraged: with lower rates of return, people may find it less attractive to save. This would increase spending. . Investment encouraged: it becomes less expensive for businesses to borrow, so they may increase investment in capital. . Value of the currency: falling interest rates offer a lower return on savings. As a result, if interest rates decrease, this may deter international money from the eurozone, therefore decreasing the value of the euro. . Costs of production: production costs will decrease due to the lower cost of capital, resulting in possible lower prices and maybe an increase in the numbers employed. . Economic growth encouraged: with possible higher investment, future economic growth in the country may be helped. . Revenue for government from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT): with less savings, the government will receive less revenue through DIRT. . Note: you could be asked about the effects of high or rising interest rates on the economy, therefore, you must also be able to discuss these. However, low or falling interest rates are more relevant for the Irish economy at present. Question The main components of national income are: consumption, investment, government expenditure, exports and imports. (i) Show the equation which links all these components with the level of national income in the economy. (ii) Explain what influences the size of each of these components of national income. (i) Y = C + I + G + X - M (ii) Consumption:. Level of income: the higher the level of income, the higher the consumption, and vice versa. . Availability of credit: as credit becomes more easily available, spending rises. Investment:. Rate of interest: as interest rates rise, borrowing becomes more expensive and investment tends to fall.. Expectations of business people: if business people are optimistic about the future of the economy, investment will increase and vice versa. Government expenditure:. Political decisions: government expenditure primarily depends on the political decisions of the government and the type of fiscal policy being pursued by the state. Exports:. Value of the euro: the value of the euro in relation to other currencies will affect the amount of exports, e.g. if the euro rises in value in relation to the US dollar, exports to the US will fall as Irish goods are less competitive abroad. . Income levels in export markets: if income levels abroad are rising, demand for Irish products may also increase. Imports:. Income: if income levels increase in Ireland the level of spending on imports also tends to rise. . Value of the euro: the value of the euro in relation to other currencies will also affect the level of imports, e.g. if the value of the euro increases in relation to the Pound Sterling, imports from the UK will increase. Question Economists use gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) as measures of economic activity. (i) Define each of the underlined terms. (ii)Which of these terms do you consider to be a more useful measure of economic activity for Ireland? Explain your answer. (iii)Discuss three limitations of national income statistics. (35) (i). GDP is the total output produced by the factors of production in the domestic economy irrespective of whether the factors are owned by Irish nationals or foreigners. . GNP is the total output produced (value of goods and services) by Irish-owned factors of production in Ireland and elsewhere. It is a measure of the income accruing to a country's residents. (ii) A possible answer:. GNP = GDP + net factor income from abroad (NFIA). GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in the country in the period. It is the fundamental measure of economic activity. . The difference between GDP and GNP is significant in Ireland as NFIA is a relatively large negative in Ireland's case. . NFIA is negative because the profits earned by multinational companies (MNCs) and repatriated back to their home countries exceed the profits earned by Irish MNCs located abroad and returned to Ireland and the interest payments on Irish debt held by non-residents also cause the NFIA figure to be negative. . The net repatriation of profits and the interest repayments on the national debt to non-residents are both outflows hence GDP is consistently and considerably larger than GNP in Ireland. . Although GDP is used for comparison with other EU countries, GNP is probably a better measure of Irish economic activity as GNP reflects only the part of economic activity that is produced and shared by Irish nationals. (iii) Possible answers include:. Population distortions Population changes must be considered with changes in national income when assessing a country's economic performance. If national income grows at a slower rate than the population, then average income per head may decrease and the average standard of living may fall. Per capita income may be a more meaningful measure of living standards than national income. . Constant prices and current prices/inflation An increase in prices will increase national income but the standard of living may fall. So changes in national income must be compared with changes in prices to consider the impact on standard of living/economic performance. GDP calculated at constant prices is a better reflection of economic growth than GDP at market prices. . Hidden social costs attached to increases in national income If a firm increases output national income increases. However, a hidden cost may be increased pollution etc. Positive and negative externalities such as congestion, waste disposal and attractiveness of areas are excluded. . Distribution of national income and poverty National income statistics give headline figures as to the overall economic performance. Further research needs to be undertaken to find how income is distributed. e.g., two countries might have the same level of GNP, however, the income distribution might be very different in both countries with consequences for the welfare of its citizens. . Shadow economy transactions not measured The black economy is excluded from the calculation of national income. The value of unreported transactions is difficult to ascertain thus underestimating the level of national income. . Nature of the goods produced A country which spends a small amount on military equipment and a larger amount on health, education etc. will have a better standard of living than one where the reverse is the case, i.e. much of its wealth is on armaments. There is a large difference in terms of relative economic well-being between the two countries yet the national income data doesn't reflect this difference. Topical issues for the 2016 exam Economists are often asked to predict the future - an unrealistic expectation! The following is by no means a predictive or exhaustive list; it is merely a selection of possible topical issues that may be relevant for your exam in June. 1. Property prices increase House prices in Ireland are certainly on the rise again since early 2013. However, the increase in national property prices is slower than last year (a possible reason for this is the drop in demand due to the Central Bank of Ireland's new restrictions on residential mortgage lending). The most recent Central Statistics Office (CSO) data shows that national property prices in Ireland in November 2015 were 6.5% higher than the previous year. This compares to the 16.2% increase that was recorded in November 2014. Increased shortages of supply and excess demand in the Dublin housing market have caused this rise in house prices. Property prices in the capital were recorded to be 3.3% higher in November 2015 than in November 2014. However, it is important to note that there are major differences across the country with regards to supply, demand and prices of property. Excess supply and lack of demand still exists in certain areas of the country, causing house prices to remain unchanged or even fall. Students should be prepared to discuss:. Factors that are causing an increase in property prices in Ireland. . Effects of this on the Irish economy.. Factors causing the rate at which property prices are increasing to be slower than last year. 2. New mortgage rules In January 2015, new mortgage lending guidelines were issued by the Central Bank of Ireland. These new rules state that buyers must have 20% of a deposit regardless of the cost of the house (with the exception of firsttime buyers who need a deposit of 10% to borrow anything up to (EURO)220,000) and that lenders must cap the size of mortgages to 3.5 times' income. In addition, those buying a house to let must have 30% of a deposit. The key reason for the introduction of these new regulations is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in the future. Student should be prepared to discuss:. The effects of these new rules on Irish consumers and the Irish economy. 3. Housing crisis The demand for housing in Dublin, its surrounding areas and other cities such as Cork and Galway has greatly exceeded the supply of housing available. This has brought Ireland from being a country that was saturated with ghost housing just a few short years ago to the point where there are not enough homes to keep pace with the growing population in its cities. The main causes of this new crisis include the collapse of the Irish economy and the burst of the property bubble which brought construction of housing to a halt from 2008 onwards. Public policies began focusing on dealing with mortgage debt and ghost housing estates rather than planning for future housing needs. Oversuppl",0,,,,,,
69,Irish Independent,26/02/2016,Absence of Brexit debate in election baffling - DKM,"ECONOMIC historians will reflect on Election 2016 and wonder how the imminent prospect of a British withdrawal from the European Union was barely raised as an issue in the campaign, economic consultancy DKM has warned. With the pound trading yesterday at a 14-year-low against the euro and hovering around a seven-year low against the dollar, DKM chair Brendan Dowling said the Brexit debate will undoubtedly lead to a slowdown in UK growth, even if Britons vote to remain in the EU. ""These factors will differentially affect Ireland given the nature and scale of its links to the UK,"" Mr Dowling, inset, said. ""At the moment it would appear that none of these factors are in the forecasts for the Irish economy."" Mr Dowling also warned that Irish voters seemed to place a ""low value"" on stable government and a high value on electing a large number of independents whose ""sole common features is their low likelihood of forming a functioning government"". He pointed to political deadlock in both Belgium and Spain, but warned neither had to deal with the possibility of the UK leaving the EU. ""When economic historians reflect on February 2016 half a century from now, they will wonder how Brexit was scarcely raised as an issue in an election which was supposedly about the management of the economy,"" he said. ""They may also wonder how so many of those seeking re-election were more concerned with redistributing the current levels of income than ensuring the continued growth of that income. ""The implicit assumption seems to have been that the economic pie would continue to grow, regardless of the election outcome, and the only issue was the appropriate division of this pie."" In its latest snapshot of economic forecasts, which give a concise outlook for the economy based on 13 sources including the Central Bank, Department of Finance, and Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), GDP will grow by 4.7pc this year, the fastest in the EU, and there will be continued strong growth in domestic demand. But risks include the uncertainty about the formation of the next government, and international investigations into the tax affairs of Google and Apple and the knock-on effects for Ireland. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the weakness in sterling is a ""foretaste"" of what's the come if the UK pulls out of the EU. ""A vote to leave is a vote for an uncertain future, that's a simple fact, and that uncertainty would generate immediate and negative reactions in financial markets,"" he said.",1,geopolitics,brexit,,,,uk
70,The Irish Times,11/04/2009,Addressing banking crisis was crucial to Budget's credibility,"It is always easier to attack than to defend complex, long-term initiatives such as Nama THIS WEEK S emergency Budget seems to have come in perhaps a little short of what some economists or foreign finance houses might have wished for, but at the top of what is currently politically sustainable domestically. Although some economic commentators view the 2009 projections for tax receipts as still being too optimistic, overall the Budget appears to have been accepted internationally as a genuine and measured, if belated, effort by Ireland to address its public finances. Whether it works will depend to a large extent on the wider economic environment in which Ireland s economy has to operate for the next few years. This depends more on decisions made in Berlin, Washington or Beijing in the months to come than those made in Leinster House last week. The abolition of the social welfare Christmas bonus payment is perhaps the most politically sensitive of the Budget announcements, which is why there were murmurs from all sides of the Dáil chamber when the Minister announced it. However, the fact that the cost of living is falling and actual cuts in social welfare rates were avoided at least for the moment will blunt some of its political impact. Notwithstanding a new-found acceptance among many sectors of the electorate that tough measures are necessary, the income tax increases announced this week are certain to add to the Government s political problems. In January, workers watched the first tranche of the new income levy come out of their pay packets. Those in the public sector saw another larger chunk of pay disappear when the pension levy was implemented in March. As a result, many workers may feel able to guess what further impact a doubling of the income levy will have on their take-home pay in May. However, the changes in cut-off points at which the different levy rates will apply is something they may not yet have appreciated. Local and European elections are often described in academic literature as second-order elections , by which is meant that they are viewed by voters as less important, and attract lower turnouts. The turnout in our last local and European elections in 2004 was comparable, however, to Dáil elections, and the results were shaped primarily by national rather than local factors or European issues. Voters felt they had been misled in the 2002 general election and were angry about the spending cuts introduced shortly afterwards. They turned out in 2004 in near record numbers for a local poll to deliver a severe mid-term rebuke to the Ahern-led government, resulting in Fine Gael winning more seats than Fianna Fáil in the European elections and coming close to being the largest party in local government. If recent polling is anything to go by, voter anger, even before this Budget, is even more intense now than it was in 2004. Some individual Fianna Fáil incumbents may be buffered by their work rate and local record, and some new faces will manage to distance themselves from responsibility for national political action to some extent. Coming as they do just weeks after workers will have felt the full punch of this week s Budget, these local and European elections are going to be more national than in 2004, and seem set to be another disaster for the main Government party. Overall, however, it is those paragraphs in the Minister s Budget speech dealing with banking rather than budgetary matters which are likely to have the most enduring political sequelae. The policy announcement to establish a National Asset Management Agency (Nama) to acquire certain property and development loans of the banks has the potential to light a political fuse. As the country was still absorbing the scale of income deductions on Tuesday evening, business and economics reporters were struggling to understand and explain the banking initiative. However, the budgetary strategy would have had no credibility without a strategy to address the banking crisis. Its inclusion in the Budget speech serves to underline the extent to which getting out of our economic difficulties requires tackling our banking crisis in tandem with our public finances. Since Tuesday, the Government has been behind the curve in trying to explain what Nama is to be and how much it will ultimately cost. It was always going to prove difficult for our political system to process this announcement. What is proposed is a large-scale, complex initiative designed to address an immediate problem with undetermined long-term consequences. As illustrated by the debate on the Lisbon Treaty referendum last year, neither our political system nor our public debate generally absorb the long-term or the complex particularly well. It is always easier to attack than to defend such proposals. There is always a temptation to engage in the type of populist rhetoric and scare-mongering in which some Opposition politicians and various pundits have engaged this week, over which some more informed economic commentators have rightly criticised them. Explaining the Nama proposal and persuading people of its merits is one of the greatest communications challenges faced by Government, one made more difficult by the level of public anger directed at the banks and the uncertainty about future prospects for the economy generally and the property market in particular. Unfortunately, doing nothing is not an option. Concerns about the level of toxic debt infecting our banks means that much of the international banking system is refusing to lend to them, and they in turn are unable to extend credit to businesses. Solving our banking crisis will inevitably involve risk and will certainly require political courage, but unless we tackle the banking problem the additional pain inflicted by this week s Budget will have been in vain.",1,monetary,lending,,,,ireland
71,Irish Independent,21/06/2012,Aer Lingus comes out fighting to stop Ryanair,"AER Lingus said yesterday that shareholders should reject the surprise EUR694m bid from Ryanair as analysts and investors questioned whether Michael O'Leary's third bid would ever be allowed.  In the first volley from Aer Lingus in the takeover battle launched by Ryanair on Tuesday evening, the former state-owned airline said the hostile bid ""undervalues"" the airline.  Shares in Aer Lingus hit a17-month high in Dublin yesterday after rising more than 15pc to hit EUR1.09. That was still 21 cent less than Ryanair's offer, which underlines doubts among many investors about whether the bid can succeed.  ""There is significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair, if made, would be capable of completion,"" Aer Lingus said yesterday afternoon.  ""The board, having considered the offer with its advisers, believes the offer, even if it is capable of completion, undervalues Aer Lingus.""  The rejection came as politicians and unions rallied to defend the 75-year-old former flag-carrier's independence.  Taoiseach Enda Kenny told the Dail: ""The Government would be concerned, obviously, in terms of competition, in terms of consumer facilities, in terms of price and access to the country.""  However, he added that the Government, which owns 25.1pc of Aer Lingus, would be powerless to halt the takeover if enough shareholders were to back the move.  Ryanair's bid would earn the Government EUR174m of its EUR3bn privatisation target.  Mr Kenny said: ""It is a minority share that the Government has. We don't have any veto over this.  ""We don't have any blocking rights and the details of the offer made by Ryanair have not yet been considered collectively by government.""  Education Minister Ruairi Quinn said that ""competition is important"" and added that he believed a Ryanair takeover would create ""problems"" if one group controlled 80pc of the air traffic out of Dublin.  Brian Devine, an analyst at NCB Stockbrokers, said Ryanair's EUR1.30 a share offer was ""probably fair"", despite the EUR1bn cash pile that Aer Lingus has sitting on its books.  Gerard Moore, an analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers, said that Ryanair ""doesn't have much to lose"" if its bid fails or succeeds.  Either the bid would force the Government to sell its stake faster than anticipated or Ryanair would gain control of Aer Lingus, he said.  Unions rushed to voice their opposition to the Ryanair move.  Siptu's aviation organiser, Teresa Hannick, insisted that it would be ""madness"" for any Government to put Michael O'Leary and Ryanair in charge of Ireland's air links.  The IMPACT union, which represents 1,600 Aer Lingus pilots and cabin crew, claimed that a takeover would be ""bad for Ireland's economic recovery, for competition and for the travelling public"".  Meanwhile, the Aer Lingus board -- headed by chairman Colm Barrington and which includes its chief executive Christoph Mueller -- queried ",0,,,,,,
72,The Irish Times,28/11/2014,Afghans get face time with their political leaders; Politicians pull publicity stunts instead of forming a new government,"Afghans are being treated to the unfamiliar spectacle of their leaders trying to outdo one another in good governance even as they remain hopelessly deadlocked on forming a new government.  When an early morning suicide bomber struck at a residential camp for foreign workers on November 18th, the first vice-president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, showed up straight from his morning workout, still in his tracksuit, complaining in a kerbside news conference about Taliban infiltration of the government. President Ashraf Ghani made a surprise 2am visit to a military hospital to make sure doctors were really on duty, visited war wounded, and has already travelled to at least three countries.  Despite an active schedule, Ghani has also earned the gratitude of his capital city by keeping his motorcades small, especially compared with those of his predecessor, Hamid Karzai, whose convoys paralysed the city for hours. On Monday Abdullah Abdullah, the national unity government's chief executive, flew to the site of a Taliban atrocity the day after it occurred, braving the anger of the locals over years of government neglect.  And on Wednesday, when the United Nations rolled out its annual appeal for international humanitarian assistance in 2015, Abdullah served as chairman for the event - the first time a top Afghan official had done so. This is all in sharp contrast to the past 12 years of Karzai, whose public appearances were increasingly infrequent and carefully restricted. But while the nation's top officials are certainly getting a lot done, and looking good on Afghan television while doing it, none of it is the main task at hand.  That would be the getting to the crux of forming a new government, already weeks past Ghani's self-imposed deadline amid lasting disagreements between the president's and Abdullah's camps. Other than the top elected officials and their immediate aides, the government is still being run by holdovers from the previous administration along with a hodge-podge of temporary appointees. This is true even in critical posts such as the ministries of defence and interior, responsible for running the war effort, and the ministries of economy and finance, which must deal with a catastrophic budget shortfall and a deepening economic crisis. ""Both sides have supporters expecting to receive a share of the power, and both sides are negotiating to maximise their position,"" said a senior Afghan official familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. No breakthrough was in sight, the official said. The national unity government was brokered by the US and the UN as a way out of a protracted crisis over a fraudulent election, giving Ghani the presidency and Abdullah the prime minister-like post of chief executive. Dragging on They agreed on an equitable allocation of cabinet choices and other government positions, but the details of who would fill the jobs were left until inauguration - and those talks are now dragging on.  The uncertainty over a new government, coupled with the economic crisis and a wave of recent bombings in Kabul, has driven the normally stable currency, the Afghani, to plunge in value, to 59 to the dollar (50 was the long-term normal, and on Wednesday it was about 58). ""Businessmen are worried that the disagreement on a new government will continue until the end of the national unity government's term,"" said Hajji Najeebullah Akhtary, who until recently was the president of the Moneychangers Union in Kabul. Some Afghans see the PR activity by their government executives at least in part as a distraction from the impasse.  ""With the bottleneck, the government has no real activities to perform, and by visiting bomb sites and other minor stuff, they're trying to make it look like they're busy doing something,"" said Waheed (26) an inventory manager for a charitable agency here who goes by just one name. Said Hajji Janan, a former council member from Wardak province: ""Since all the ministers and governors are acting employees, none of them are taking their responsibilities seriously anymore, and the country is going through a very hard time."" Still, even those who are critical see positives to the one-upmanship at the top, given that the usual complaint against the government is that it is unresponsive to everyday Afghans.  ""The election created competition between them, and now they are competing to prove who is more proactive and has got more popular support,"" Waheed said.  At the UN aid drive, Mark Bowden, the agency's humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan, was appreciative: ""We've never had such a stellar cast from the government side attending this event."" The United Nations is attempting to get foreign donors to contribute toward its $405 million (EUR 324 million) goal for aid to refugees, disaster victims and malnourished Afghans. Warlord past Dostum, in particular, has taken every possible opportunity to burnish his own image, which suffers from his history as a warlord during the country's brutal civil war. As recently as 2013, he set his private gunmen on a governor who had displeased him. Years before courting Dostum to be his first vice-president, Ghani criticised him as a ""known killer."" Last week Dostum publicly donated blood for the military and made sure that 300 of his guards and followers did so also (Ghani donated a month earlier). And after years of rarely, if ever, meeting journalists, Dostum on Monday gathered a group of them in honour of the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists.  He spoke about how he supported women's rights and a free press, and even announced plans to start a fund with his own money to provide for needy or ailing journalists. But journalists who desecrate religion will get no mercy, he added. ""I will strangle such a person myself."" - (New York Times service) Five dead in attack on British vehicle A Talibani suicide bomber rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a British embassy vehicle in Kabul, killing at least five people including a British security guard. Afghanistan's interior ministry confirmed that four Afghans were killed in the attack and another 33 civilians were injured.  Afghan police said a vehicle packed with explosives rammed the heavily armoured embassy vehicle, exploding on impact .

73,Irish Independent,04/04/2019,"After a major shift in May's position on Brexit, there's still everything to play for as Merkel comes to town","ANGELA Merkel visits Dublin today. The German chancellor's trip was announced only days ago. The most powerful leader in democratic Europe does not take time out of her schedule to visit small countries on a whim. She will discuss Brexit and Border issues with the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach talked about these same issues with Europe's second most powerful leader two days ago. Leo Varadkar went to Paris on Tuesday to meet his French counterpart. Emmanuel Macron said France would never abandon Ireland. Both leaders have backed the Taoiseach to the hilt on Brexit and the Border backstop. Neither France nor Germany, publicly or privately, has ever seriously pondered throwing Ireland under the bus on the issue that has broken British politics. But all relationships involve give as well as take. Ms Merkel is here to make clear that she expects Ireland to fulfil its obligations to Germany and the rest of the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. With extensive direct shipping routes between Ireland and France, and French farmers hyper-alert to the risks of cheap food leaking into the EU market via Northern Ireland, Mr Macron has an even greater interest in Ireland meeting those obligations. It has always been clear, as this column has repeatedly set out, that if the UK leaves the EU without agreed terms, Ireland will be obliged to collect import taxes on goods coming from Northern Ireland and to ensure that those same goods meet EU laws and standards. The European Commission in Brussels polices EU rules. At this 11th hour in the Brexit fiasco, the Government and Brussels are in intensive talks about how Ireland would fulfil these obligations. This week Michel Barnier, the man whom EU leaders tasked with negotiating Brexit, said such checks were needed ""in order to avoid any kind of controls inside the single market"". This was a not-so-subtle highlighting by the Frenchman of the choice Ireland would face in the event of a no deal: fulfil its EU obligations on goods coming into the Republic from Northern Ireland or face barriers to goods going from this island to continental Europe. The Government continues to be less than clear on how it is facing up to this choice. Brussels has been upping the ante over the past week by talking of an ever greater risk of a no-deal Brexit. Thankfully, and despite Brussels's public assessment of the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, the risk of the worst happening has declined again over the past week, even if it is still worryingly high. For the first time since January 2017, when the British prime minister declared she was seeking a hard Brexit, Theresa May has made a substantive change to her position. On Tuesday evening, after spending a full working day locked in a meeting with her cabinet, she effectively dissolved her hard Brexit red lines. Instead of trying to achieve what she had sought for so long with her own party, she announced that she would attempt to reach a cross-party consensus and then take direction from the House of Commons (she had previously refused to be bound by parliament's mere 'indicative' votes). This is a major shift. But it by no means eliminates the risk of a no-deal exit. There remain a dizzying number of issues to be resolved before that happens. The biggest questions now are for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party and a life-long hard leftist. He has always believed the EU to be a capitalists' club. Its free market mechanisms - the customs union and the single market - have never held any appeal to him. According to the Corbynista worldview, free markets generate bad things for the least well-off, including insecurity and inequality. EU rules limiting governments' freedom to control the commanding heights of the economy are another reason to seek to be free of its constraints. Ideology is one reason Corbyn's Labour Party is less than enthusiastic about the EU and all its works. Expediency and opportunity are others. Why should a party that has been sidelined on even this most crucial of matters help save Mrs May's floundering government? Why would a party that has been out of office for a decade risk sharing the blame for the Brexit fiasco? Could Mr Corbyn resist bringing the government down and precipitating an election he could well win if the opportunity arose in the coming days? It has become clichéd to say that there are more twists and turns to come in the tortured saga of Brexit. That remains as true as ever, even at this very late hour. et's conclude with the positive news on the economy in recent days, and how limited the fallout from Brexit has been for people's lives and livelihoods. LUsually, a cocktail of economic and political uncertainty gives consumers the jitters. That makes them salt more cash away and splash out less. Less spending and more saving cause economies to slow in the short run. Uncertainty of the kind currently being experienced tends to spook businesses even more than individuals. When companies see potentially big changes to their trading environment just over the horizon, they invest less in new capacity and hire fewer workers. Both these effects have been evident in Ireland for some time. But the good news is that weaker consumer and business confidence has come nowhere close to halting the economy's overall momentum. Even better news is that despite Brexit dominating more and more public and private conversations, the effects on behaviour (as opposed to sentiment) have been limited. Late last week new figures showed that spending by consumers grew in February. Last Tuesday's figures on the Government's finances showed no sign of a slowdown in the rate at which revenues are flowing into Exchequer coffers in the first three months of the year. Earlier the same day, the State's statisticians estimated that unemployment in March had fallen to its lowest level in 11 years. If Brexit risks can be avoided, things look quite rosy for the Irish economy.

74,The Irish Times,01/12/2012,After Greece: Ireland's next move,"Europe moved this week to grant a new swathe of financial concessions to Greece in a renewed effort to prevent the country falling into an abyss. Only days before another harsh budget in Dublin, the development underlined the Irish Government s failure to prise a debt-relief deal from its sponsors in the euro zone. Although economic conditions in Greece are far worse than in Ireland, there are questions about whether the new arrangement for Athens should prompt Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister for Finance Michael Noonan to intensify their campaign.  I would, given the recent Greek deal, wait for a while to see whether the EU/euro zone responds; [there is] no point pushing hard now, having not done it before, says Kiron Sarkar, a former Rothschild investment banker who writes a financial newsletter.  However, if by January there is little movement, I would push far more aggressively. The EU/euro zone needs Ireland, in particular, as it is its only success story. In future it needs to offer incentives, rather than just penalties, to those that perform, [as that] will encourage a better response from the relevant country.  In such arguments there s little to gain by always being nice. Better to get down and dirty than to be teacher s unerring pet, or so the argument goes. Kenny has extracted a vague political promise, but little more, from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that something will be done in recognition of Ireland s special situation. Still, the Taoiseach is no pushover. Last year he doggedly resisted a Franco-German assault on Ireland s corporate-tax regime. Although the interest rate he received in the end will save a grand total of EUR 12 billion, this was granted in a package to quell a market onslaught on Italy and Spain. In June he refused to sign up to new arrangements for Spain until a specific reference to Ireland was inserted. Notably, however, the value of that breakthrough faded fast. The prospect of direct capital infusions from the European Stability Mechanism fund into the likes of AIB and Bank of Ireland is on hold. The focus now is on a deal with the European Central Bank to recast the Anglo Irish Bank promissory-note scheme. More than a year into the talks, however, there is still no agreement. Would it ever work to get gritty? After all, straight talk won t necessarily lead to a wilful act of disruption and might demonstrate an urgency to settle matters quickly. But this remains tricky. You ve got to think long and hard about upping the ante, says a European official who knows the intricate ways of the Brussels machine. You go for a showdown only if you have a reasonable expectation that it will yield results. The risk of hyping things up is that you may get a rather more categorical No than you want.  Warning signals are already emerging. Even as the Government explores whether any of the new Greek concessions might be made available to it, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has declared his opposition. This matches scepticism in Germany about Ireland s need for additional aid. More radical still would be a repudiation of a EUR 3.1 billion Anglo repayment due next March, which would involve a damaging default on a sovereign debt. The same goes for any unilateral shunning of any other debt, something the ECB repeatedly refused to countenance when it insisted the Government repay senior bank bondholders in full. Hence the view among close observers that any such move would be politically unsound, financially dangerous and, ultimately, self-defeating. To renege on debt would compromise the credibility of the Government as borrower, the very thing Dublin needs to cultivate if it is to free itself of the yoke of the bailout next year. To call the ECB s bluff might threaten well in excess of EUR 100 billion in emergency support for the Irish banking system. It is because of such support that the banks function. In the end, this is all about reliability, as the salutary case of the former Greek premier George Papandreou illustrates. A year ago he was treated to strident public diktats from Merkel and the then president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, for having the gumption to propose a referendum on the bailout. Critics bristled at this extraordinary intrusion into Greek affairs, but Papandreou s international standing sank, and he was replaced by an unelected technocrat. A similar fate befell the former Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi after he reneged on his promises to the ECB to assert control over his wayward public finances.  I would be very much of the view that Europe does not operate on an antagonistic basis. For sure, the right strategy is to frame the case as what is best for Europe, says Prof Philip Lane of the department of economics at Trinity College Dublin. The new Greek arrangement comes at a pivotal moment for Ireland. It is two years since the disastrous banking guarantee inexorably led the faltering State into the clammy embrace of the EU-EC-IMF troika, meaning the Government must secure its return to private markets within 12 months. Attitudes towards the bedraggled Irish have improved markedly since the dismal days at the outset of the bailout, but all the praise in Europe will not pay off the debt.  I believe that what Noonan has done so far is very good, and we know where the problems lie, says a participant in the talks in Brussels. Yet a solution acceptable to all remains elusive. Not only is Ireland s national debt huge, thanks to the bank rescue and large ongoing budget deficits, but it is still expanding rapidly. The latest Department of Finance forecast suggests the general Government debt, representing the totality of the State s gross debt, will reach EUR 192 billion next month. This sum is four times greater than in 2007, before the eruption of the crisis. A further EUR 34 billion will be borrowed between 2013 and 2015. The European Commission estimates that Ireland s all-important debt-to-GDP ratio, which measures public indebtedness as a proportion of economic output, will reach 122.5 per cent next year. (This is slightly higher than the Government s own estimate in the table, right.) This is above the 120 per cent threshold the IMF generally considers unsustainable. The ratio will drop a little in 2014 but will remain very close to 120 per cent. In Brussels this month the economics commissioner, Olli Rehn, did not reply to a question about whether Ireland s debt could be considered sustainable without relief on the bank rescue. The sense remains that Ireland is not really a priority for Europe at the moment. Although the debt question has assumed totemic status in unending domestic debate, that s not the case elsewhere. At the highest levels in Europe, it is well recognised that leaders move only when forced into emergency action. At a time of concern about the deteriorating Franco-German relationship, anxiety about a possible British exit from the EU and lack of clarity about Greece, Ireland is far from the top of the list. This calls to mind a maxim attributed to the storied US diplomat Dean Acheson, secretary of state in the early 1950s under President Harry Truman: Negotiating in the classic diplomatic sense assumes parties more anxious to agree than to disagree.  It is clear by now that Ireland is more anxious than its partners to agree. But all of this uncertainty is not without risk for the bond yields that will determine Ireland s cost of borrowing at the end of the bailout. You cannot interpret the success of the past year, in terms of getting the yields down, independently of the presumption that a bank deal will be achieved. If that deal disappears, the current reduction in yields could reverse, says Prof Lane. Debt relief: What are Ireland's best options? Promissory notes: the Government s main aim is to spread out the cost of this 20-year IOU scheme over a longer period, possibly 40 years, at a lower interest rate. For this to work, the ECB would need to commit to a long-term resolution plan for the former Anglo Irish Bank, but it disapproves of emergency banking support. Direct ESM aid: the European Stability Mechanism permanent bailout fund buys shares from the Government in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB. For this to reduce Ireland s debt, the ESM would have to pay for historic losses in those banks. Germany, Finland and the Netherlands have rejected that option for involving mutualisation of bank debts. A further drawback is that direct ESM bank aid was conceived for Spain, but it has not applied for any. This means there is no precedent for the deal the Government is pursuing. The new deal: What Greece got The latest deal for Greece marks the third attempt in a year to settle on a workable second bailout for the debt-struck country. After most private investors incurred voluntary losses on their Greek bonds earlier this year, the agreement reached on Tuesday morning will see euro-zone governments grant new financial concessions to the country. In return for EUR 43.7 billion in new aid between now and the end of March next year, the Greek government has enacted laws to extract EUR 13.5 billion from the budget in the next two years. That is twice the comparable Irish retrenchment (EUR 6.6 billion) in the next two years. In the deal the interest rate on Greece s borrowings is being scaled back, and a 10-year deferral of interest payments will save a cumulative EUR 44 billion. Although Greece will buy its debt from investors below its face value, euro-zone countries will also forgo their profit on the Greek bonds held by national central banks. The current stated aim is to achieve a debt level of 124 per cent of national output by 2020, still above the IMF limit after another decade of rectitude. If Europe s joint pledge with the IMF to bring that below 110 per cent by 2022 is to be met, euro-zone countries may have to take losses on their loans to Greece.",1,debt,,,,,ireland
75,The Irish Times,23/07/2009,Agencies are capable of pivotal role in recovery,"OPINION:Democracies are hard things to manage that s why we have agencies to help out, writes MAUREEN GAFFNEY LADIES AND gentlemen, fellow citizens, we need to get a grip here. In the wake of the report of An Bord Snip Nua , there has been a national outbreak of self-loathing. How could we have got it so wrong? What national madness took hold? And that was even before the Sunday papers got going with the bloodbath of solutions ahead complete with colour cartoons of Colm McCarthy as butcher, axe murderer, and scissorshand. The McCarthy report has done the State some service. It paints a picture of excess, waste and restrictive work practices which grew like bindweed around the delivery of services, a situation that few could defend. It questions the existence of many State agencies. Aside from a few organisations that deliver a core of essential services, no group has a right to exist and none without scrutiny and re-examination. Without a doubt, there is evidence of duplication and overlap in some areas. There is clearly justification for reduction and rationalisation where that is demonstrated. I also believe that many good agencies will be closed down because we can t afford them anymore not because they don t do excellent work, let s be clear about that. The report and much of the commentary on it contains unexamined, unspoken assumptions for which no evidence exists. Firstly, that Government departments are more efficient than State agencies. Secondly, that the functions of various agencies can be taken back into Government departments. Thirdly, that Ireland is some crazy outlier in respect of its use of multiple agencies. Does anyone think that if a similar exercise was conducted in the US, the UK or any developed OECD country, it would find a pristine, minimalist government landscape? Of course not. The business of managing complex modern democracy is just that complex. There is also an almost wilful historical amnesia in some of the reaction to the report. Remember the entire agenda of modernising government which everybody was so enthusiastic about a decade ago? That agenda emerged from the realisation that the socio-economic challenges facing government in a rapidly-changing world are more complex, uncertain and unpredictable than they were in the past, making it difficult to respond in a way that meets the higher expectations of the public. Central to this agenda is reform of public services. While modernising initiatives have taken varying forms in different countries, certain key features were common. Most included a focus on outcomes and value for money; better understanding and management of risk and ensuring users of public services rather than providers were the focus. Crucially, modernisation also involved challenging existing models of service-delivery by the wider involvement of people outside government and greater collaboration and partnership with the private and non-profit sectors. This in turn called for the creation of arm s-length executive agencies as a way of bringing public and private sectors together in a way that allowed them to act independently at different levels local, regional and national. The goal was to build a more responsive, customer-focused approach by utilising the local knowledge and specific expertise of agency staff. That was the thinking behind the creation of most agencies and it is still legitimate. This raft of initiatives as implemented by the Clinton administration in the US, the Blair governments in the UK, and by governments in Australia and New Zealand has been termed the New Public Management . But trying to modernise government is no easy business and the results have been patchy everywhere. Policy assessments undertaken by the US Office of Management and Budget have found that of the 1,016 federal programmes it had assessed by the end of 2006, only 18 per cent were judged to be effective, with a further 31 per cent moderately effective, 29 per cent were adequate, 3 per cent ineffective, and the results were not demonstrated in the rest. In the UK, the overuse of performance measures and targets has been criticised for stifling creativity and creating perverse incentives. Issues of accountability and autonomy, as between parent departments and agencies, have continued to be a problem in most states. In Ireland, the civil and public service responded quickly and, for the most part effectively, to the modernising challenge. Irish policymaking has been innovative and entrepreneurial over the past decade, particularly in the area of equality and social exclusion. At their best, Irish policymakers have also introduced a central coherence into policymaking through the social partnership process and the lifecycle approach. But we have our own peculiarly Irish problems. In the social partnership process alone, I think I counted about 80 working groups operating at one point. There have been persistent problems associated with the management of pilot projects, including inadequate evaluation, failure to terminate unsuccessful projects, and failure to mainstream successful projects. In the past decade in particular, the growing use of multiple agencies with multilevel governance often led to increasingly varied approaches to policy making, policy drift, and consequently greater challenges in monitoring success and failure. But the failure here was due not to the agencies. All the modernising initiatives described above, particularly the creation of executive agencies, implied a changing role for government in a more complex society a role of strategic co-ordination rather than policy control. This is where we stumbled. Agencies can only operate effectively if they are given a clear remit and strong support. In a world where issues develop, change and mutate rapidly, the agencies dealing with them have to be monitored and expanded, modified or closed down as required. In Ireland, we seemed unable to close anything down. But we found other ways to kill off programmes or agencies. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former Harvard professor and counsellor to the US president, once observed: withdrawing funds and favour is only the most obvious way to do that. Establishing a competing programme is more elegant and usually more effective, with the newly-established competing programme having goals and rhetoric barely distinguishable from the other programme. Consciously or otherwise, we rather specialised in that modus operandi here. Before we ever had zombie banks, we created zombie agencies. I can t help thinking that when finally presented with the full list of department-sponsored agencies, there must have been murmurings of surprise among some top civil servants. Now these ghostly agencies have been dragged into the full glare of the An Bord Snip limelight and stand condemned. The process of softening up the public to get them ready for a public execution is already well established, this time led by a few overexcited politicians and media commentators. Agencies are no longer referred to by their individual names, but by the pejorative general term quango . The key point is this: we need to recognise that the solution to too many agencies is not a reversion to a 1950s-style system of governance. Government departments are the linchpin for delivery of State services. But the essential function of departments is to implement the policies of the government of the day. They must do so within strict rules, with discretion and without criticising government policies. Social radicalism is not a civil service function. Neither is advocacy. Government departments, no matter how innovative, are large bureaucratic institutions. With their broad remit, they are unable to give the sustained focus and attention to particular areas of activity that smaller, more activist State agencies can. Necessarily, they are at a greater remove from the local, intimate knowledge of particular groups or problem areas. Because of their size and way of functioning, they are not able to respond in the rapid and nimble way a good State agency can. Indeed, one of the major weaknesses of the McCarthy report is the almost exclusive reliance it places on large-scale as the route to effectiveness. As American commentator Thomas Friedman said, in the age of globalisation it is not size that is important but speed. Before, the big ate the small. Now, the fast eat the slow. In any case, we have recently had painful reminders from the Ryan report of just how spectacularly a government department can fail. Had there been at that time even a semblance of an independent State agency with a specific brief to protect children, akin to the Ombudsman for Children s Office, it is hard to envisage such sustained physical and sexual abuse occurring that happened under the watch of the Department of Education. In the months ahead, important decisions will be taken. We need to be vigilant that in the rush to a kind of pseudo-efficiency we don t create further problems for the future. We must be careful that we don t undermine the progress we have made over the past decade in creating a modern developmental State that networked web of Government departments, State and other agencies capable of delivering the mixture of income support and tailor-made services identified as the most effective way to tackle a complex issue like social exclusion. A command-and-control-style government cannot deliver nuanced, bespoke solutions like that. No doubt, in some redoubts, there may be a longing for the paradise lost of command-and-control government. But that is what it is paradise lost; and it was never much of a paradise anyway. If that mindset prevails, State agencies will be indiscriminately shut down, or amalgamated into Government departments. We will be assured that their functions will continue. And then? I will leave the last word to Moynihan (adapt as necessary for Ireland): But the pattern persists: the bright idea, the new agency, the White House swearing-in of the first agency head, the shaky beginning, the departure 18 months later of the first head, replacement by his deputy, the gradual slipping out of sight, a budget bureau reorganisation, a name change, a new head, this time from the civil service, and slowly obscurity covers all.  Never was sober reflection and considered debate more needed in Ireland than in the coming three months.  Maureen Gaffney is a clinical psychologist. She is chairwoman of the National Economic and Social Forum, which advises Government on economic and social issues, and is a member of the board of the Health Service Executive.

76,The Irish Times,14/01/2003,"Agreement is no January bargain as Exchequer counts benchmarking costThe partnership deal between unions and employers will come at a cost to the Exchequer, but could provide some stability at a time of economic uncertainty, writes Cliff Taylor, Economics Editor","Partnership looks to have been saved - but at a price. There is much that is welcome in the proposed terms of the new deal from an economic viewpoint: it should help to maintain industrial peace, the basic increases should not be inflationary and it provides some stability in a time of considerable economic uncertainty. The price tag, however, does not qualify as a January sale bargain. It comes for the Exchequer in the E1.1 billion cost of implementing the benchmarking increases for public servants, which are a central part of the proposed agreement. The Government has agreed to pay the benchmarking awards in three phases ""subject to final agreement on a modernisation programme for the public service"". 03011400084 Thus public-sector workers will receive much more generous increases from the deal than their private-sector counterparts, if the deal is finally agreed by both sides. The benchmarking report, published last year, recommended increases averaging 8.9 per cent for public servants, which the authors said was justified on the basis of studying comparable jobs in the private sector. When added to the 7 per cent basic increase proposed in the new agreement, this means public servants will receive an average rise of 16 per cent under the terms of the new deal, although they will not receive the final element until mid-2005. In contrast, private-sector workers in companies which stick rigidly to the terms of the deal will receive 7 per cent over the the 18 months. Neither has the Government been able to afford to promise to top up take-home pay through tax cuts, a central element of all previous national deals. As the trade union movement is dominated by public-sector unions, the delivery of benchmarking - once likened by ICTU president Senator Joe O'Toole to ""an ATM machine"" - will be a powerful factor pushing them to accept the deal. However for the Exchequer finances, it will come at a cost - public sector pay is set to rise by 11 per cent this year and by a further 6.7 per cent next year. In an era of budgetary tightness, this will restrict the room for other measures in the 2004 Budget, just as it did in this year's package. What will be left for measures to attack poverty and disadvantage in the 2004 Budget, for example? There are two key factors about benchmarking. First, the report provided no detail whatsoever about the job comparisons between the public and private sectors used to calculate the recommended increases, which ranged from as low as 2.5 per cent to as high as 25 per cent, averaging 8.9 per cent. Given the extent of the bill being imposed on the taxpayer, this lack of transparency is extraordinary - it leaves unanswered legitimate questions about the rationale for the increases and has left those public servants who are to receive lower increases disgruntled. University teachers - who are to get just 3 per cent - have taken the matter to court. The second key benchmarking issue is that the increases were meant to be delivered on the basis of significant changes in work practices in the public sector. The Government statement on the latest talks said the payment is subject to the final agreement on modernisation talks now under way between unions and the Government. However the detail of these talks remains unclear. The concern is that the benchmarking awards - now surely irrevocably promised - will be made on the basis of nominal concessions in terms of productivity. Given the extent of the increases, the Government as employer must look for significant flexibility and increased productivity so that the cost is reflected in genuine improvement in our public services. Put bluntly, if - for example - teachers are to get the 13 per cent increase recommended under the report, then the first requirement is that no more be heard of ASTI's complaints on the supervision and substitution deal. And, like other professionals, teachers must be prepared to grant a range of meaningful changes in the way they work in return for being ""benchmarked"" to the private sector. Better pay for public servants must translate into better services for the public. It remains to be seen whether the Government can deliver on this - but putting dates on the payments before negotiating the modernisation programme does not appear to leave it in a strong negotiating position with its employees. In terms of private sector employers, the deal should not undermine competitiveness. However nor will it boost industry's competitive position, which has been somewhat eroded over the past couple of years. About 25-30 per cent of companies are unionised, but many of the rest tend to take their lead from the figures negotiated in national agreements. For this year, the average payroll increase will come in at 3.5 per cent - roughly in line with our major trading partners. The total of 7 per cent over 18 months may still be a bit ahead of the international norm, though not by a enormous amount. However the formula of the early national agreements - low nominal wage increases to boost competitiveness backed up by significant income tax concessions - is no longer possible because of pressure on the Exchequer. What is important this time is that companies who genuinely cannot afford to pay the 7 per cent due to competitive pressures are able to pay lesser increases - or none at all. Many firms ended up paying more than the terms of the previous deal - the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness - and some businesses will be looking for flexibility on the downside this time around. There is already evidence that some multinational employers have frozen pay increases over the past year. In the year ahead, the more profitable employers, such as most of the big financial organisations, will have no difficulty paying the increases. However for smaller indigenous companies already facing competitive pressures in Britain and US markets due to the rise in value of the euro, it may be a different story. As Prof John FitzGerald of the Economic and Social Research Institute pointed out yesterday, a further sharp rise in the value of the euro is a significant competitive threat facing the economy and could yet leave many firms unable to pay. That said, the deal does not tie down increases for a lengthy period and it is clear that all sides will hope to sit down in a more certain economic environment towards the end of next year to negotiate a successor. The Government will hope that it adds an element of stability in an otherwise potentially volatile year, when the threat of war in Iraq has contributed to deep uncertainty about the outlook for the world economy.",0,,,,,,
77,The Irish Times,15/03/2008,Ahern calls for calm in face of 'pessimistic' growth forecast,"TAOISEACH BERTIE Ahern has called for a calm approach to the economy and warned against ""short-term, knee-jerk reactions"" which, he said, would cause unnecessary damage to long-term prospects.   At a press conference after the Brussels summit of European leaders, he played down the significance of the latest forecast for the Irish economy from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) on the basis that it was only one of a range of different assessments available. ""The ESRI is forecasting a GDP growth of 1.8 per cent, 1.6 per cent GNP. That's the most pessimistic that we've seen on the Irish economy so far,"" Mr Ahern said. ""Economic forecasting, as we all know, is an uncertain exercise and, for a small, globally-integrated economy such as us, the uncertainties that are out there at the moment are magnified. There's no doubt about that and this is apparent from a whole range of forecasts currently available. ""But they are all very different. I'm not getting into the business of which one is right. NCB (stockbrokers) this week published a forecast of 3.5 per cent of GDP growth for the year so here you see, in the one week, [ forecasts] that are going from 1.8 to 3.5."" He pointed out that the Department of Finance's budget day forecast of GNP growth of 2.8 per cent for this year, 3 per cent for GDP growth, had not been changed. ""In terms of the public finances, the Tánaiste is providing for a modest deficit this year. That's appropriate at this stage of the economic cycle. We examine these things in the late autumn and early winter."" Ireland was once again running a current budget surplus. ""We're borrowing modestly to invest ambitiously. We have to keep on doing that."" He added: ""All sectors of construction are going very well this year with the exception of the one that we know, the residential side."" Although the Government was ""upfront"" about economic and fiscal risks, Mr Ahern stressed that, ""at this stage it's important that we remain calm and avoid taking short-term, knee-jerk reactions that would damage long-term prospects and there's no need for that"". The Government would emphasise the need to retain flexibility and continue to raise productivity. ""If we do this, it will protect and enhance competitiveness and employment levels."" Another policy priority was slowing the rate of increase in public spending: ""We have to control public spending and we've set that out in our book of estimates and in the budget process."" It was also important to restore confidence in the housing market, ""through the stamp duty changes, increasing the ceiling for mortgage interest relief"". From a policy perspective, there were international economic developments over which Ireland did not have control, ""but they do highlight the importance of improving competitiveness"". He added: ""We can do that; we can work hard as we've done several times over the last 20 years to improve competitiveness when we needed to do so. We have to address that through putting money into education, into skills, investing in infrastructure - well over 5 per cent of GDP in the National Development Plan - maintaining stability in the public finances, which we're going to have to do this year and we're going to have to do that strictly, and maintaining a low burden of tax on profits and wages. ""These are the issues that we have to manage. It's a more difficult year, it's more difficult internationally. It's a global situation but, if we keep our nerve and manage ourselves through as we've done successfully now for 20 years, we'll come outside of the downturn in a strong position.""

79,The Irish Times,22/05/2003,Ahern hopes for decision on fees within two weeks,"The Taoiseach has declined to rule out the introduction of student loans in the ongoing controversy over third-level fees. Mr Ahern said, however, that no legislation to allow for such loans would be forthcoming in the current Dail session, which ends in July. He hoped, however, to have the issue of third-level fees dealt with and cleared by Cabinet before the start of the Leaving Certificate exams in two weeks' time. He was speaking during a stormy session yesterday, as the Opposition repeatedly challenged him to set out exactly what the Government's proposals were on fees. 03052200030 The Labour leader, Mr Pat Rabbitte, echoing the view of the Union of Students in Ireland, said the controversy was an entire smokescreen for the introduction of a loan scheme, which would have the support of the PDs, would be punitive for ordinary people and would force skilled people into emigration. The PDs have since expressed their opposition to a loan scheme. The Fine Gael leader, Mr Enda Kenny, said the Taoiseach should show leadership, remove the uncertainty hanging over the 50,000 Leaving Certificate students and their parents, and abandon any proposal to reintroduce third-level fees. Mr Ahern, who made a staunch defence of the Government's record on education, repeated that no decision had been made to reintroduce fees. There was still a difficulty in one area - access for those in lower socio-economic groups to third-level education. ""It would be totally irresponsible not to look at this issue,"" he insisted, adding that he would not take lectures from people ""who say we do not care about the disadvantaged"". Mr Ahern said the Opposition only cared about the people who were wealthy and already in third-level education. But if you were disadvantaged, on the margins and on welfare the Labour Party and Fine Gael did not care ""two hells"" about you. Mr Kenny, who raised the issue, said that in two weeks students would sit their Leaving Certificate English exam and would be marked for clarity and conciseness in their replies. He asked the Taoiseach to state clearly there would be no fees. ""With absolute clarity"", Mr Ahern replied, he hoped to have the matter dealt with and cleared at Cabinet before the Leaving Cert started. Mr Rabbitte said the discussion was a smokescreen for the introduction of a loan scheme. That was going to put people on moderate incomes ""in hock"". There would be a brain drain as a result, as in Australia, and young, skilled and educated people, which the economy needed, were going to emigrate. That was what was wrong with a loan scheme being contemplated by the Government, that was going to have the support of the PDs, ""and that's what's going to save the Minister, Noel Dempsey's neck. It is a disgrace because it will impose significant hardship on ordinary people,"" Mr Rabbitte said. Mr Ahern said the Australian example might not be right, but Australia had the strongest economy in the world, its education was considered good, like Ireland's, and Mr Rabbitte's argument did not hold up. There were now 120,000 people in third-level education compared to 40,000 previously, and there was one issue left. About 50,000 people earned over E100,000 and ""a sizeable number earn over E200,000 and they pay nothing at all for the education system. I do not think that is right."" Mr Rabbitte said that Ireland had the second-lowest spend in Europe as a percentage of GDP on education. It would take a generation to know the impact of the removal of fees.

Mr Ahern emphasised its ""soundness"" and its ""real contribution to continuing confidence in the Irish economy"". It would send out a ""message of confidence at home and abroad that ""we are determined to remain on top of the situation despite the further deterioration in the world economy"". 02120600048 He warned against tax harmonisation, lauded the completion of the schedule to reduce the corporate tax rate to 12.5 per cent, and defended the Government's modest borrowing increase. There were many uncertainties ""not least the uncertainty over Iraq, and our aim must be to get through this period with minimum disruption"". Mr Ahern said the Budget was ""socially caring"". There was in real terms no reduction in Government expenditure and in fact ""there is likely to be a modest real increase"". The overall positives included a modest general borrowing requirement of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product next year. Other European countries and the former Asian tigers had shown ""how quickly economic reputations built up painstakingly over a long period of time can be undone, if the right action is not taken in good time"", he said. Some had suggested the Government could afford to borrow more. ""But I have no desire to see this country under the sort of pressure that we were facing in the past or indeed that some of our partners are under today in struggling to achieve acceptable deficits, nowadays defined as below 3 per cent of GDP."" The Budget meets ""two imperatives. It strikes the right balance between social protection for today's people and today's needs, and investment to underpin and secure our economic prospects into the future"". Lower personal taxes had been maintained, and the move to a unified corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent had been completed on schedule. Defending the rate against the background of renewed European debate on tax harmonisation, he said it ""would have been very unwise from a confidence point of view to delay or defer completion of the process of achieving a unified rate of corporation tax"". Warning against tax harmonisation Mr Ahern pointed to the US, which had a fully federal constitution and said that ""a key part of the competition between different States is their freedom to set different rates of business taxes"". On personal income tax rates, he said that ""only 30 per cent of those potentially subject to tax are on the higher rate, which has been reduced to 42 per cent. ""We have over-indexed tax credits and bands consistently in the past few years, so the pause in this year's Budget, given the difficult circumstances, will I believe be understood by most taxpayers.""",1,security,iraq wars,,,,iraq
81,The Irish Times,01/11/2008,Ahern says he would relish challenge of fiscal crisis,"FORMER TAOISEACH Bertie Ahern has said he would ""relish"" leading the country as it faces into grave economic uncertainty. Mr Ahern said it would not be his first time facing such an adverse situation, referring to his handling of the currency crisis of the early 1990s when he was minister for finance. ""I would have in a lot of ways relished the challenge of dealing with the [current] difficulties,"" he said. The former taoiseach, speaking to The Irish Times, said the crisis of 1992 had presented a ""hell of a challenge"". ""Every day you were wondering where the Irish pound was going; and you were fighting off devaluation."" Turning to the current situation, he said: ""You know from a political point of view I would have managed the challenge. But, as we know, that's life. It wasn't to be."" At the same time, he strongly rejected the contention that economic policies from his time in government were responsible for the crisis. He pointed to the low debt-to-GDP ratio in the past decade saying it insulated the State against a ""bumpy period"" in the economic cycle. ""The opposition continually attack me about the property market [saying] the price of houses was too high,"" he continued. ""But we tried to get supply and demand into equilibrium. ""Of course the property market slowed down ultimately, not only here but all over the world. And now they say it's something to do with our policies. ""Granted, [property] was over-priced. We all knew it was over-priced and the correction had to happen in the market. Unfortunately, it happened as the consequence of a credit squeeze internationally,"" he said. Mr Ahern was speaking in advance of the screening by RTÉ of Bertie, a four-part documentary about his life which begins on Monday night. The series, directed by Steve Carson, is made by Mint which also made the earlier high-profile series, Haughey (2005), and Fine Gael: A Family at War (2004). A request by The Irish Times for a preview copy of the series was turned down by RTÉ. Over 70 friends, associates and political colleagues were interviewed for the series including Mr Ahern's wife, Miriam, from whom he is separated, his daughters Georgina and Cecelia, and many of his associates, including Barry English, Joe Burke, Chris Wall, Dave McKenna, Paddy Duffy and Des Richardson. His former partner Celia Larkin declined to participate. Former British prime minister Tony Blair is also interviewed as are Mary Harney, Charlie McCreevy and Brian Lenihan. Mr Carson said he submitted the idea to RTÉ in August 2006, a month before the disclosure of the digout loans to Mr Ahern from 1992. Kevin Dawson, RTÉ's commissioning editor for factual programming, said that one of the motivations behind making the series was the contradiction about the former taoiseach that for such a well-known figure, he was surprisingly little known. ""His own daughter Cecelia says in the series that even as his child she would feel that he is unknowable in some way. She could talk to him for 15 minutes about something and afterwards realise that there was no deep communication,"" said Mr Dawson. Mr Ahern yesterday said that he was not a complicated person. ""Maybe the conspiracy theory is that there is no conspiracy theory,"" he said. An associate also told the film-makers that Mr Ahern first began planning to become taoiseach in 1977, within weeks of first being elected to the Dáil. Mr Ahern said this was not so. He also said he did not want the series to be made and agreed to be interviewed himself only in July of this year. ""I was faced with only two options then, not to do an interview or to do an interview and have it included in the programme as they saw fit. What I decided was to do the interview and at least put across my story."" He neither encouraged nor discouraged friends to participate. Not having yet seen the programme, he said the ""acid test"" for him would be the amount of time allotted to his personal finances compared to his work on the North and the economy. ""The controversy of the tribunal-related stuff was effectively an 18-month period of my life. It will be interesting to put a stop-watch on the programme's four hours and see how much 18 months gets out of 57 years [his age].""",1,debt,,,,,ireland
82,The Irish Times,21/04/2007,Ahern signals support for PD pledge on stamp duty reform,"Taoiseach Bertie Ahern seemed to signal his support yesterday for the pledge by the Progressive Democrats to reform stamp duty before the Dáil summer recess, if Fianna Fáil and the PDs are returned to government. Mr Ahern told reporters yesterday: ""The concept of doing it in the summer and not waiting until the budget makes sense"". Earlier, Tánaiste Michael McDowell committed the PDs to abolishing stamp duty for first-time house buyers and introducing bands to make the system fairer. He said if his party returned to government the reform would be implemented with immediate effect to ensure market stability. ""There will be no phasing-in period. We will do this through legislation enacted before the new Dáil rises for the 2007 summer recess,"" he said. The Opposition leaders poured scorn on Mr McDowell's pledge. ""I'll challenge him now, if he's serious about his stamp duty proposals, Fine Gael and Labour will facilitate him next week in the Dáil to change stamp duty. If he has that much clout over this Government, let's do it next Tuesday and Wednesday in the Dáil,"" said Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny. Labour leader Pat Rabbitte also attacked the Tánaiste, saying he had had five years in office to change stamp duty but had not done it. He added that in any case what Mr McDowell said now was irrelevant as he would not be back in government. Fine Gael and Labour have pledged similar stamp duty reform as a priority but have refused to give a timetable. Minister for Finance Brian Cowen refused to be drawn on the PD plan and said he did not want to take any action that would disrupt the property market. ""If you look at everything I've done in the past it has been geared towards the first-time buyer,"" he said. He would not say whether Fianna Fáil would unveil a stamp duty proposal before the general election. Mr Cowen was in Berlin to attend an informal meeting of finance ministers. Speaking at his press conference to launch the PD economic policy document Sustaining Success, Mr McDowell said he had discussed the issue with Mr Cowen and he shared his view that a pledge to change the stamp duty regime without a clear timetable would be destructive of the property market. ""I am operating on the basis that Brian Cowen means what he says, that it would be wrong to prolong uncertainty for any period. I believe there is a willingness across the two parties in Government to address the matter sooner rather than later. ""I speak for the PDs and Fianna Fáil will speak for themselves. I cannot force their hand but I am absolutely confident that the package should be introduced before the Dáil goes into recess for the summer,"" the Tánaiste said. He said the PDs had come up with their proposals last autumn, Fine Gael and Labour had come up with their plan and Fianna Fáil might well come up with proposals before the election. Mr McDowell refused to say whether acceptance of stamp duty reforms would be a precondition for entering into another coalition with Fianna Fáil. The PD plan involves the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers and the banding of the rates so that house buyers only pay the higher rate on the proportion of the price over each threshold. The other key commitments of the PD economic manifesto are a reduction in the higher rate of income tax to 38 per cent and the lower rate to 18 per cent. The tax bands will be widened so that a couple, both earning, can earn at least EUR 100,000 and only pay income tax at the standard rate, while a single worker would earn EUR 50,000 and only pay at the standard rate. A married couple with one earner could earn up to EUR 59,000 and only pay tax at the standard rate.",0,,,,,,
83,The Irish Times,26/02/2003,"Ahern warns recovery is two years offBusiness leaders at management award ceremony told they must remain competitive in an uncertain environment, writes Edward Power","Global economic recovery may be at least two years away, the Taoiseach told business leaders last night. With the jobless rate in the United States predicted to breach 8 per cent by the end of this year, it was apparent that the global downturn would continue over the medium term, Mr Ahern said. Speaking at the Irish Times/PA Consulting Group Management Award, Mr Ahern reiterated the Government's determination to keep a tight rein on spending, warning that borrowing to fund infrastructure development could saddle the State with a potentially unmanageable deficit. 03022600137 The award was won by United Drug, the pharmaceuticals wholesale and distribution group. Although the Taoiseach's overall tone was cautious, Mr Ahern expressed optimism for the next national pay deal, saying it would help copperfasten competitiveness. He reaffirmed his commitment to upgrading State infrastructure, citing a E1.2 billion outlay on road projects this year. But Mr Ahern insisted the Government would not follow the lead of those European states that are in the process of running up heavy deficit to meet short-term expenditure. While others substantially increased borrowing, the Republic's debt-to-GDP ratio fell last year and was set to remain stable in 2003, the Taoiseach said. ""As the uncertainty continues, all of us who are managers face tough decisions,"" he added. ""It is important to remain competitive and not get tied up in deficits."" Accepting the award, Mr Martin Rafferty, chairman of United Drug, paid tribute to the Mayo pharmacists who established the group in the late 1940s and to its employees, whose dedication had proved vital to the company's continued growth in Ireland in Britain. Ms Maeve Donovan, managing director of The Irish Times, said that, in the current environment of economic uncertainty - one that had been exacerbated by the looming threat of war in the Gulf - good management practice is more important than ever. Mr Michael Maguire, country head of PA Consulting Group, said the successes of recent years had prompted a profound shift in the dynamics underpinning the economy. As a result, the boundaries between public and private sectors had become increasingly blurred and there was now a ""compelling argument"" for forging closer links between the two. ""Related to this is the idea that some further consideration could be given to those non-policy functions currently undertaken within the public sector, and seeing if the private sector could make a useful contribution here,"" said Mr Maguire. ""As experience has shown elsewhere, the private sector can have a substantial role to play in the delivery of public services,"" he said. First held in 1977, the award gives public recognition to excellent management practice. The competition is open to organisations throughout Ireland, with the objective of rewarding outstanding performers in industry, commerce and public administration. The award is made to an enterprise that has generated outstanding results through a strategic, driven and innovative management style. Previous winners include Musgraves grocery group and DCC, the value-added marketing and distribution firm. The judging panel for this year's event included: Mr David Dilger, chief executive of Greencore; Mr Jim O'Hara, general manager of Intel Ireland; Sir David Fell, chairman of the Northern and National Irish Banks and former head of the NI civil service; and Mr Eddie Sullivan, secretary general of public service management and development at the Department of Finance.",0,,,,,,
84,The Irish Times,13/10/2007,Ahern's heir should note success of his full-term policy,"The power to call an election is among the most significant powers held by prime ministers in those political systems where parliaments do not have fixed terms, writes Noel Whelan   Prime ministers will usually seek to exercise this power at the moment best suited to ensuring their party will be re-elected to government. A wily premier can pull a surprise, spring an election on the country at short notice, and hit the campaign trail running, leaving the opposition to catch up. Alternatively, he or she can play cat-and-mouse with the opposition (and indeed with the media), hinting that an election is imminent, causing opponents to burn up resources on election preparations, only to have it all set at naught when the election is not called. Talking up the prospects of an election or even letting election speculation build can be risky, however, as British prime minister Gordon Brown learned last weekend. Only time will tell whether Brown's premiership has been fatally damaged by the bout of cold feet he suffered when the polls chilled. In our political system the legal authority to dissolve the Dáil at any point before the end of the statutory five-year term is a trump card for the Taoiseach. As long as he has a Dáil majority, he gets to exercise that power unhindered. In practice, there may be party political or coalition considerations, but ultimately it is he and he alone who has to make the call as to when to go to the country. It is he who gets all the credit if he gets it right and who carries all the blame if it goes wrong. Irish taoisigh have learnt the hard way that the power to call elections can be a sharp double-edged sword. In 1989, Charles Haughey, still jet-lagged after a long-haul trip to Japan, and irritated that his minority government had lost another Private Members' motion in the Dáil, allowed the more bullish of his ministers to persuade him to call an election even though his government wasn't even halfway through its term. It was a bad move. Fianna Fáil returned after that election with even fewer seats and was compelled to go into government with the Progressive Democrats. Elsewhere John Bruton is still criticised by some Rainbow politicians who, with the benefit of hindsight, claim he should have called the 1997 election in the autumn of that year rather than in the early summer. Bertie Ahern has managed to avoid the pitfalls of election timing. Indeed, one of the most striking features of Ahern's tenure as Taoiseach is how he has forgone some of the benefits of holding this power by indicating at the outset that his governments will run full-term. It is said that when his first cabinet had its inaugural meeting in Áras an Uachtaráin after the 1997 election, Ahern told them there and then that it would be a full five years before the next general election. Although many doubted him during both his first and second terms, he was true to his word, going almost to the last possible moment before calling the elections in 2002 and 2007. Many of his political colleagues and strategists advised him against leaving it so long. In fact in both 2001 and 2006 some of those closest to Ahern gave off-the-record quotes to newspapers suggesting he was blowing his best chance at re-election by not going to the polls four years in. Both times, however, Ahern stuck with his original schedule and, notwithstanding turbulence in the polls, economic uncertainties and late breaking stories about his personal finances, he twice came out the winner. Even the manner in which Ahern carefully constructed his current government by bringing the Green Party and some Independents in with the Progressive Democrats owes much to his desire to nail down a comfortable majority so that his party can again be in power for a full term. It has proved a very wise move, especially in light of the lackadaisical approach of some of his deputies towards turning up for Dáil votes. However, Ahern's days of calling elections are over. As of now, it is odds-on that it will be Brian Cowen who will next exercise this power. The informal head-counting has already begun within Fianna Fáil. Anywhere that two or more TDs, party advisers or even journalists gather for a political natter of any length these days, the topic of conversation inevitably turns at some point to whether it will definitely be Cowen. Of course, Dermot Ahern is right when he says that open speculation about the succession is premature, but that doesn't stop it happening in private. In Fianna Fáil, only TDs get to choose the leader. The view of most Fianna Fáil parliamentarians is that the next leadership contest looks like remaining a one-horse race. Interestingly, however, many of them when pressed say that if a real alternative to Cowen ever emerges, it is more likely to be Mícheál Martin than any of the other reported contenders. In the words of one deputy: ""The Corkman hasn't gone away, you know."" If Cowen does become the next Fianna Fáil leader he is likely to find himself in circumstances similar to Gordon Browne's. He, too, may benefit from a honeymoon bounce. He, too, will have come to the top job after years of being second in command. He will also have many advising him to seek his own mandate. However, if watching Bertie Ahern up close hasn't already persuaded Cowen of the merits of leaving elections to the last possible moment, then Browne's recent difficulties surely will.

85,Irish Independent,24/12/2016,Alarm bells are sounding - yet the Government is spending like crazy,"THE economic landscape is going to look very different in three years' time. And when it does, we will be able to point to 2016 as the year when things really began to turn. It might not seem obvious now, given that the economy will grow at the fastest rate in the eurozone this year. Unemployment continues to fall and our exports remain very solid. But we have been hit with a three-punch combination in 2016 and the damage hasn't yet been seen. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump in the US and renewed questions about Italy's future in the euro all spell bad news for our economy. None of them are of the Government's making. Yet, the problems they throw up are likely to be compounded by decisions made in Government Buildings and Leinster House, from public sector pay, water charges and the housing crisis, to expenditure increases and complacency about our tax revenues. The Irish economic recovery has been truly astonishing. We have gone from running a budget deficit of 32pc in 2010 to less than 1pc in 2017. The real turnaround happened in the last three years when we were reaping the benefits of the pain taken in the austerity years, while also getting incredibly lucky on three fronts. Our recovery enjoyed triple tailwinds of a cheap euro to help exporters, low oil prices which helped everybody and low interest rates which kept borrowing costs down. The State has also benefited enormously from being able to borrow cheap sovereign debt on the bond market. But things are beginning to shift. With Brexit, the euro has risen in value against sterling, one of our most important export markets. Oil prices have remained relatively low but are now starting to tick upwards. Interest rates remain low but as they start to go up in the US, we may see change closer to home. Uncertainty about the nature and timing of the British withdrawal from the EU will be a drag on our economic performance. Thousands of jobs, mainly in indigenous firms, are under threat from a hard Brexit. The uncertainty could go on for years, with the British ambassador to the EU warning in recent days that a new UK/EU trade deal could take a decade to negotiate. If anything, the pending Trump presidency is an even greater mystery. His determination to boost the American economy could even play in our favour. But it all depends on how he does it and what sort of longer-term damage he does to the exchequer of the largest economy in the world. If he slashes US corporation taxes to 15pc, there is an argument that says Ireland should benefit through the increased investment that richer American companies might make. However, it all depends on how he cuts corporation tax. The suggestion is that cuts will only be available for companies that export from the US and do not import goods produced abroad to the US. This would be a new corporate tax system not simply based on a percentage of profits but based on the origin of the product and the investment flows that surround it. In other words, US corporations would be financially incentivised to reduce foreign investment and make more at home. This could undermine the flow of future US inward investment to Ireland. Separately, the EU is yet again pushing for a harmonised corporate tax position based on where products are sold and not where the company behind them is registered. Economists have warned that such a move would seriously erode our corporation tax base, which is expected to bring in (EURO)7bn this year. Then there is Italy. Italian banks have not dealt adequately with their legacy bad loans and high cost base. Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), the country's third biggest bank, is trying to raise around (EURO)5bn in new capital from private investors. Unicredit wants to raise (EURO)13bn. If MPS fails, it goes under or is bailed out by the Italian government. Under new EU rules, a government bailout must see bondholders burned on part of their investment. Billions of its bonds are held by ordinary Italian investors who would lose a lot of money. Junior bondholders could lose 80pc to 90pc of their investment in a forced state bailout. Italy is not far away from electing a government that wants out of the euro. It may come to that unless the country can politically push through massive reform. But it failed at the first hurdle when the electorate rejected reforms in a referendum earlier this month. As the third largest economy in the eurozone, Italy is too big for a bailout. Economic alarm bells are going off all over the place - in London, Brussels, Rome and Washington. So what is our Government doing? Well it is abolishing water charges, spending like crazy, awarding public sector pay increases to anyone who threatens to strike and finding new ways to subsidise its way through the housing crisis. It runs the risk of squandering the potential gains of years of austerity through new spending commitments before even getting its hands on the money. The Fiscal Advisory Council crystallised it very well in recent weeks when it re-visited the socalled ""fiscal space"" in the years ahead. It said half of the money available for spending increases or tax cuts in 2018 has already been used up by the full-year effects of last October's Budget. Any increase in spending on public sector pay next year, for example, would have to be paid for by increased taxes or cuts in other areas of spending. Nobody will pay a cent for water, other than businesses and group schemes, despite the billions needed to upgrade the network. First-time buyers will land (EURO)15,000 in free money from the State, irrespective of their wealth or income, as a way of getting around Central Bank mortgage rules that have now been changed anyway. Exchequer figures for November were well ahead of target in several categories. Much of it was corporation tax and self-assessed income tax based on earnings made in 2015. Vat is a useful realtime barometer of spending and confidence and it was the only tax category behind target. The Government needs to change tack and stop trying to buy its way out of tough political problems. Unfortunately, Dáil arithmetic makes that look impossible. This has been the year of living dangerously. We will need to be lucky to escape the consequences. It runs the risk of ; ; squandering the gains ; ; of years of austerity ; ; through new spending ; ; commitments ; Graphic   Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe during the annual recital by the Department of the Taoiseach staff choir.

86,Irish Independent,15/03/2018,"ALiving Subject; In order to do well in the Economics exam, students need to keep on top of current affairs and should practise answering questions, writes Yeats College teacher Shauna Mujic","Why is Ireland the fastest growing economy in Europe? Has Ireland's economic growth rate been overestimated? How do banks make a profit? How will Brexit affect the Irish economy? Why are house prices spiralling, once more, out of control? When you tell people that you are studying Leaving Cert Economics, these are the sort of questions you may be faced with. At this stage in your Economics education you will have discovered that there is no end to the conversational questions, nor to the knowledge that you are required to have for your exam. Economics is not your average subject. Less than 6,000 Leaving Cert students will sit this paper on the morning of 21 June. Whether you are excited by the intrinsic diagrams and theories of microeconomics or you have always been interested in what causes economic growth and government policies, this subject is a passion of yours. Don't waste that passion, don't think it won't help you; it is a vital ingredient in excelling at Economics. However, now is the time to get super organised. Economics is often referred to as the 'social science' and just like any science there is a system behind studying it. Economics is all around us and is relevant to everyone's daily lives. If you read the weekly newspaper or watch a current affairs programme on television, you are guaranteed to come across some economic issues that you may be asked about in your exam in June. Topical issues are vital in the economics exam and the H1 student is required to have knowledge of a range of topical and current economic issues outside of their textbook. Breakdown of topics Leaving Cert Economics is divided into two major categories: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics deals with how individuals decide what goods or services they are willing to buy or not to buy; and how firms try to reduce costs in order to maximise profits. Higher and Ordinary Level Duration of exam: 2 hours 30 minutes (150 minutes) Total marks for exam: 400 marks START: 10 minutes should be spent reading, highlighting and picking your questions Section A: Short questions - 100 marks: 25-30 minutes You must answer six of the nine short questions asked. Questions 1-5 carry 16 marks Questions 6-9 carry 17 marks (therefore questions 6-9 must be answered to maximise marks) Timing: 4-5 minutes per question Questions based on the entire course Section B: Long questions - 300 marks: 1 hour 40 minutes You must answer four of the eight questions asked. Each question carries 75 marks in total Timing: Spend 25 minutes per question Bullet point answers should be used Note: Generally, in Section B there are three to four microeconomics questions and four to five macroeconomics questions. However, in recent years many questions have been mixed with different topics and some have even contained a combination of micro and macro topics. Hence, students cannot 'cherry pick' topics or try to take short cuts when preparing for their exam. Ideally, you will be left with 10 minutes at the end of the exam to tidy up your paper General tips for students 1. Most long questions in Section B have three to four separate parts. You may be able to answer two parts very well and the rest of the question you may know very little about. Therefore, make sure to read all of the question before attempting to answer it. 2. Time is of the essence! As part of your revision, practise answering questions within the time allowed (see the paper structure section above to remind yourself of the time allowed for questions). Do not exceed this time limit. A main reason why students often fall down in the exam is due to incorrect time management. Make sure to match time spent on a question with the marks available for it. 3. Make sure that the detail of your answers is appropriate to the available marks. The general rule is that if there are 20 marks available, give 4 points at 5 marks each (2 marks to state and 3 marks to explain for each point). This is usually true for 90% of the paper. However, there can always be exceptions, so always try to give an extra point for good luck, where possible. 4. Students should answer Section A, the short questions, first, as this section will briefly span over many topics, giving you the chance to get ideas moving in your mind for Section B. Remember, questions 6-9 in this section carry 17 marks each and questions 1-5 carry 16 marks each. Therefore, to score the maximum of 100 marks you should answer all questions 6-9 at 17 marks and two more at 16 marks. Ensure to practise and revise the previous 10-12 years of examination papers, as examiners sometimes repeat the same types of questions. 5. The state and explain method: you must develop answers with detailed, relevant points, ensuring to state each point and then explain it in 2-3 well developed sentences. This is necessary for both long and short questions and you should always fill the spaces provided for short questions in Section A. Example: Q. Outline one function of the European Central Bank (ECB). A. To maintain price stability within the eurozone. (correct, but this answer will not even get you half marks, as you have stated the point, but not explained it) B. To maintain price stability within the eurozone: This is the key aim of the ECB. This is done so by closely monitoring inflation (keeping it below 2%) in member countries and adjusting the base ECB interest rate (currently at 0%) to influence consumer spending and investment. (This answer will get you full marks, as you have stated the reason and fully explained the answer). 6. Use bullet-point answers: Don't write essay-style answers in Section B. Bullet point answers should be used, and you should make sure to begin each point with a new paragraph. This allows your explanation to be focused on one idea only and prevents you from duplicating points. Start your section B with the question you feel most comfortable with and this will give you a boost for the remaining questions. Each point should be written using the state and explain method above. 7. Do not take shortcuts when you are in the process of revision. A lot of students tend to leave out the section on the history of economic thought. This is not advisable, as this area is often asked as a small part of a 75-mark question in Section B. In questions on national income, Keynes is often included. In questions on competition, Adam Smith is sometimes included. Friedman may appear in inflation or banking questions. In population questions, Malthus can appear, and so on. 8. Diagrams should be clear and large. Ensure diagrams are titled and each axis, curve and point are labelled correctly. Double check this in your exam. Also, practise explanations of the diagrams drawn: every diagram you draw, you must be able to explain it correctly. Allow yourself plenty of room when drawing these diagrams - don't try to save space in the exam. Each diagram you draw should take up half an A4 page. 9. Identify the outcome verb: make sure you do this before answering the question, so you know exactly what the verb (the thing you are being asked to do) means in the context of the question. Examples: analyse, compare, evaluate, discuss, outline, explain, define, state. Candidates often lose marks in the economics exam by not correctly identifying and answering using the correct outcome verb in the question. 10. Keep up-to-date with relevant topical issues: this could include topics such as price levels, exchange rates, interest rates, unemployment figures, economic growth figures (GDP, GNP) government budgetary position, etc. If you decide to do a question on the paper that requires any current knowledge, it must be current and exact! You must use the latest figures; they must correlate with the marking scheme. Some important definitions p The law of diminishing marginal utility states that as a consumer consumes more units of a good the extra satisfaction or marginal utility derived from each additional unit consumed will eventually decline. p The law of diminishing marginal returns states that as more units of a variable factor of production are added to other (fixed) factors of production the returns to the variable factor will eventually fall. p Capital widening is a scenario where there is an increase in the capital stock in the economy but the capital/labour ratio (amount of capital per worker) remains unchanged. This is where capital increases and labour also increases in line with it. p Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total output produced (value of goods and services) by the factors of production in the domestic economy irrespective of whether the factors are owned by Irish nationals or foreign factors of production (MNCs, etc). p Gross national product (GNP) is the total output produced (value of goods and services) by Irish-owned factors of production in Ireland and elsewhere. This excludes any earnings by foreign factors of production in Ireland and it is the measure of the income accruing to a country's residents. p Primary liquidity ratio/liquidity coverage ratio is the amount of money with respect to short-term deposits that the Central Bank of Ireland requires commercial banks to keep in cash form. p Net factor income from abroad (NFIA) is income earned by Irish factors of production abroad and sent home (repatriated) minus income earned by foreign factors of production in Ireland and sent back to their own country (repatriated). This is the difference between GDP and GNP. p Balanced regional development is when the Government identifies and targets regions which are disadvantaged or economically depressed and then implements policies which positively discriminate in favour of these regions. p Balance of payments on the current account refers to the difference between total exports and total imports. (Visible + invisible exports) - (visible + invisible imports) p Harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) is an indicator of inflation and price stability for the ECB. It is a consumer price index (CPI) which is compiled according to a methodology that has been harmonised across EU countries. How parents can help . Encourage your teenager to clear some space on their smart phone and download a couple of business broadsheet apps, such as the Irish Independent news app, selecting economy and business as the main areas of interest. Spending 5 minutes a day reading through the top stories is an easy and interesting way to stay in the know about topical issues for the exam. . Quiz students on what they have read in the news each week. You can help your child to stay up-to-date and interested in current affairs by bringing up topical economic issues from the news and starting a relaxed conversation about these at home or in the car. . Practising exam questions is the best way to study for Economics and understanding is the key to remembering in this subject. Encourage your child to work their way through as many short and long exam questions as possible by topic and break their study down into manageable chunks - taking on too much at one time can make students feel overwhelmed. . Ensure the business section of the broadsheet you buy is left where your teen is likely to see it and read through it in their own time. . Quiz students on their definitions as these need to be perfect to excel in Economics. You will find a short list of some very important definitions below. SAMPLE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Section A - Short questions SAMPLE QUESTION: Outline why ""choice"" is fundamental to the study of economics. Solution: In economics, resources are limited/scarce and have alternative uses (e.g. money), however consumer wants are unlimited, therefore, choices must be made on how to allocate these scarce resources. This is done by firstly prioritising needs over wants, involving opportunity cost. SAMPLE QUESTION: A ""high concentration ratio"" is a key feature of an oligopolistic market. (a) Explain this statement. (b) Outline two ways oligopolists behave in the market. Solution: (a) A high concentration rate exists in an industry if a small number of firms account for a relatively large part of the total output of the industry. (b) Oligopolists act in a way that affects the behaviour of their competitors: as firms are interdependent, every decision a firm takes will be based on the likely reaction of their rivals. Oligopolists usually compete via non-price competition: this is any action, other than lowering price, taken by firms to increase sales. SAMPLE QUESTION: (a) Outline the primary responsibility of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). (b) Is selling bonds at a low yield good or bad for the Irish Government? Explain your answer. Solution: (a) The NTMA is mainly responsible for borrowing for the exchequer and national debt management in order to ensure liquidity for the exchequer and to minimise the interest burden over the medium term. It also manages the Central Treasury Service, which offers cash management facilities to non-commercial state companies. (b) Selling bonds at a low yield is good for the Irish Government because it means that the cost to the Government of raising money is reduced. SAMPLE QUESTION: Outline one possible social benefit and one possible social cost of the Irish Government investing in infrastructure. Solution: Social benefit: Attracts foreign direct investment: enhanced infrastructure should enable Ireland to attract more foreign investment into the economy. This will result in benefits of increased employment, increased incomes, economic growth and a better standard of living. Social cost: Opportunity costs of funds: the funds used for developing these projects could have been used for alternative purposes which may have benefited society in general. For example, the Government could have spent money on improvements in the health services or education. SAMPLE QUESTION: Explain what is meant by the term the 'black economy'. State one method by which the Government could discourage this activity. Solution: The black economy is all economic activity that goes unrecorded in the national income accounts. This is also referred to as ""non-market economic activities"" or the shadow/underground economy. Method: Reduce taxation rates: if the Government did this, citizens may be more inclined to be tax compliant and buy legitimate goods and services as less of their income is being deducted on taxes. This will reduce activity on the black economy (such as smuggling cigarettes, etc). Section B - Long questions ÷DEMAND, SUPPLY AND ELASTICITY SAMPLE QUESTION: Distinguish between the economic meanings of a ""movement along a demand curve"" and a ""shift in a demand curve"", with the aid of appropriate diagrams. Solution: Movement along a demand curve is caused by a change in the selling price of the good itself (ceteris paribus -all other things being equal.) This results in a change in quantity demanded, at different prices. PP1 P2 D/C QQ1 Q2 shift in a demand curve is caused by a change in any of the factors other than the price of the good itself. This will cause the demand curve to shift to the right (an increase in demand) or to the left (a decrease in demand). In this case, we say that there has been a change in demand at any given price. PD/C2 D/C 1 QSAMPLE QUESTION: Outline FOUR factors that determine the demand of a good or service. Sample answer: Changes in the price of other goods: Substitute goods: (e.g. Lyons and Barry's Tea) -If the price of a substitute good increases, then the quantity demanded for the good itself will increase, causing a rightward shift in the demand curve. -If the price of a substitute good decreases, then the quantity demanded for the good itself will fall, causing a leftward shift in the demand curve. Complementary goods: (e.g. cars and petrol) -If the price of a complementary good increases, then the quantity demanded for the good itself will fall, causing a leftward shift in the demand curve. -If the price of a complementary good decreases, then the quantity demanded for the good itself will increase, causing a rightward shift in the demand curve. Changes in consumer incomes: Normal goods: (e.g. L'Oréal shampoo) -If income rises, then the quantity demanded for a normal good will increase, causing a rightward shift in the demand curve. -If income falls, then the quantity demanded for a normal good will decrease, causing a leftward shift in the demand curve. Inferior goods: (e.g. Tesco own-brand shampoo) -If income rises, then the quantity demanded for an inferior good will fall (as the increase in income is spent on higher quality goods), causing a leftward shift in the demand curve. -If income falls, then the quantity demanded for an inferior good will increase (as there is less money to spend on higher quality goods), causing a rightward shift in the demand curve. 3. Consumer expectations: • If consumers expect the price of the good to be higher in future (e.g. stocks and shares) or that the good will become scarcer in the future (e.g. oil), then the quantity demanded for the good will increase, causing a rightward shift in the demand curve. • If consumers expect the price of the good to be lower in the future (e.g. property prices during a recession) or that the good will be in plentiful supply in the future (e.g. fruit after a good harvest), then the quantity demanded will decrease, causing a leftward shift in the demand curve. 4. Change in consumer tastes: • If consumer tastes change in favour of the good, then the quantity demanded will increase, causing a rightward shift in the demand curve. • If consumer tastes change against the good, then the quantity demanded will decrease, causing a leftward shift in the demand curve. SAMPLE QUESTION If the price of a Giffen product were to fall (all other things being equal) would more or less of the product be purchased? Explain your answer with reference to the substitution effect and the income effect. Sample answer: Substitution effect: The quantity demanded for the good increases. This is because the good is now relatively cheaper due to its price reduction, so the consumer is getting increased marginal utility for their good. Income effect: The quantity demanded for the good decreases. This is because the consumer now has additional real income due to the reduction in price of the good. As this good is a Giffen good, the quantity demanded for it will decrease and the rise in income will be spent on better quality goods. Overall, the demand for the good would decrease, as the income effect is much larger than the substitution effect for a Giffen good. This proves the theory that a Giffen good has a positive price effect. SAMPLE QUESTION Which figure stated below is most likely to represent each of the following: • Income elasticity of demand for inner city bus transport • Income elasticity of demand for Kellogg's Cornflakes • Price elasticity of demand for cuts of organic meat. +2.6 -0.2 -3.3 Give reasons for your choice in each case. Sample answer: YED for inner city bus transport is -0.2 -Inner city bus transport is an inferior good with regards to income, therefore a negative sign. -Bus transport is a necessity for those using it to commute, therefore income inelastic (figure less than 1). YED for Kellogg's Cornflakes is +2.6 -Kellogg's Cornflakes are a normal good with regards to income, therefore a positive sign. -Kellog'gs Cornflakes are a non-necessity and therefore income elastic (figure greater than 1). PED for cuts of organic meat is -3.3 -Cuts of organic meat are a normal good with regards to price, therefore a negative sign. -Cuts of organic meat are a non-necessity and therefore price elastic (figure greater than 1). ÷MARKET STRUCTURES SAMPLE QUESTION Explain, with the aid of a diagram, the long-run equilibrium position of a monopoly firm. Solution: Price MC AC P1 SNP C CWXMR D = AR Q1 Q The firm is earning super normal profits because average revenue is greater than average costs (covering its costs and making extra profits) and these super normal profits can continue to exist in the long run due to barriers to entry. Equilibrium price is charged at P1 and equilibrium output produced at Q1 Equilibrium occurs at point X, where marginal cost equals marginal revenue and marginal cost cuts marginal revenue from below/marginal cost is rising at a faster rate than marginal revenue. The cost of production is at point C, which is not the lowest point of the AC curve (point W), however at this point the firm is covering its costs and making a normal profit. The firm is considered to be wasting scarce resources and not operating efficiently as it is not operating at point W, the lowest point of the average cost curve. This is due to additional costs of advertising, innovation, branding, etc. SAMPLE QUESTION (i) Explain the term 'price discrimination', giving one example. (ii) State and explain the market conditions necessary for price discrimination to take place. Solution (i) Price discrimination is when goods and services are sold to different consumers (in different markets) at varying ratios between marginal cost and price, when the price difference is not due to changes in costs of production. Example: By location: Netflix is more expensive in Ireland than in the UK. (ii) Some monopoly power: A firm that price discriminates must have some ability to alter the market price by exercising control over its demand, supply, or both. If freedom of entry existed in the industry, competitors would enter where the firm was charging the higher price and earning super normal profits, and this would continue and drive price down until only normal profit was being earned. Separation of markets: The markets must be distinct and separate. This ensures that a good purchased in the lower priced market cannot be resold in the higher priced market, which would make the charging of different prices in the two markets impossible. For example: railway times and different fares. Different consumer price elasticities of demand: It must be possible to differentiate between consumers with different price elasticities of demand. Consumers with greater PED are charged lower prices for their goods, for example students and pensioners are assumed to have lower incomes and so are not in the position to pay full price for certain goods/services, so they are often offered discounted rates to entice them to buy and thus increase sales. ÷FACTORS OF PRODUCTION SAMPLE QUESTION: Outline TWO economic characteristics of 'land'. Sample answer: 1. Land is fixed in supply: Nature has provided only a certain amount of land. Therefore, an increase in price being offered for land will not result in an increase in quantity supplied, as it is not possible to do so. The supply curve for land is vertical (perfectly inelastic). Quantities of land can be reclaimed from the sea and soil erosion takes place, but these have little effect on total supply. 2. Land has no cost of production to society as a whole: Land is a gift provided by nature and has no cost of production to society as a whole. Therefore, the supply price of land (the price that has to be paid to bring it into use) is zero. Hence, any payment for land is above its supply price of zero and is known as ""economic rent"". SAMPLE QUESTION: The price of residential property has increased in Ireland in recent years. Discuss four reasons for this development. Solution: Note: This is very topical for the 2018 exam, as the house/land prices in Ireland are on the rise again. Use these same points and make them relative to the question being asked. Economic growth: The Irish economy is growing, with a GDP growth rate of 10.5% for the third quarter of 2017. With economic growth and increased employment more people are demanding property and therefore, prices increase. Banking (availability of loans): Financial institutions have eased lending restrictions. Interest rates (dictated by the ECB) have stayed at a very low level (base interest rate at 0% since March 2016), therefore the cost of borrowing money (mortgages) is low. This has increased demand for housing/land and therefore increased prices. This has been further enhanced by the Central Bank of Ireland's mortgage rules for first-time buyers only needing a deposit of 10% of the value of the property and since 2017, the Government's new 'Help to buy/build scheme' (income tax rebate for first-time buyers). Immigration/age structure of the population: There have been many returning emigrants and a rise in immigration into Ireland. An increasing proportion of Ireland's population is within the age group capable of buying property. This has increased the demand for housing/land and therefore increased the price. Speculation in housing: Increases in property prices fuel speculative demand, with more people seeking to invest in property as it is viewed as being a safe and sensible financial move. This causes increase in demand for housing/land and therefore, a further increase in prices. SAMPLE QUESTION State and explain the factors affecting the level of investment in the Irish economy Note: you could similarly be asked about factors that cause a rise or a fall in the level of investment; just make the points relative! Sample answer: Interest rates: As interest rates decrease, the cost of borrowing decreases. Therefore, the profit earned will be higher, resulting in a rise in investment. Interest rates in Ireland are relatively low (the ECB base interest rate is 0% since 2016), encouraging investment both nationally and from foreign direct investment (FDI). Business people's expectations: If business people are optimistic about the economy, they are more likely to invest in new enterprises or expand old ones. Currently in Ireland, due to economic growth, many business people in Ireland are beginning to feel optimistic again about the future of the economy and so are more likely to invest. Government economic policies: If government policy is favourable towards investment, then investment tends to rise. Examples of favourable policies currently in Ireland include a policy to maintain corporation tax at current levels (12.5%) and continued development of infrastructure. Certain government policies in Ireland at present also deter investment, such as the plan to reduce DIRT every year until 2020 when it reaches 33%. This will encourage savings and discourage spending and investment. The international economic climate: Ireland is an open economy, which relies on FDI. If the international economic climate is in a slump, then this may result in a fall in FDI into Ireland. The US and the UK, our largest trading partners, are both experiencing times of economic and political turmoil, which may result in a drop in FDI into Ireland from these countries. However, Ireland may also stand to gain from Brexit as a result of multinational companies re-locating to Ireland from Britain in order to freely access the EU market, once Britain officially exits the EU. SAMPLE QUESTION: State and explain how a government budget could be affected by each of the following developments: • A fall in interest rates • A fall in taxation rates • A rise in subsidies Sample answer: A fall in interest rates: • Government current expenditure would decrease, as interest repayments on national debt would decrease. • Government current revenue would increase, as lower interest rates mean people and businesses will borrow more, spend more and therefore there is more tax revenue for the government. A fall in taxation rates: • Government current revenue could increase, as there may be an increase in purchasing of certain commodities due to lower direct and indirect taxes, increasing the amount of tax revenue generated - but the final effect depends on the price elasticity of demand for the commodity. An increase in subsidies: • Government current expenditure increases because the State will have to increase its expenditure to fund the subsidies (e.g. subsidised childcare). • Government current revenue may increase, depending on the commodity being subsidised (e.g. subsidised childcare may encourage more parents to work, meaning greater revenue for the Government through income taxes). . Note: similarly, be prepared to answer this question without being given the list of factors in the question, for example: ""State three developments/factors that could affect a government budget and explain how each would affect it"" ÷NATIONAL INCOME AND ECONOMIC GROWTH SAMPLE QUESTION: (i) Define gross domestic product and gross national product. (ii) Which of these terms do you consider to be a more useful measure of economic activity for Ireland? Explain your answer. Solution: (i) Gross domestic product is the total output produced (value of goods and services) by the factors of production in the domestic economy irrespective of whether the factors are owned by Irish nationals or foreigners. Gross national product is the total output produced (value of goods and services) by Irish-owned factors of production in Ireland and elsewhere. It is the measure of the income accruing to a country's residents. (ii)The difference between GDP and GNP is significant in Ireland. GDP is larger than GNP in Ireland's case, as NFIA (net factor income from abroad) is a relatively large negative due to: 1. Profits earned by MNCs and repatriated back to their home countries is greater than the profits earned by Irish MNCs located abroad and returned to Ireland. 2. The interest payments on the foreign elements of Ireland's debt. 3. The remittances (money sent back home) of immigrants in Ireland sent abroad is larger than the monies sent back to Ireland by Irish emigrants living abroad. Therefore, GNP is a better measure of Irish economic activity (and our standard of living) as GNP reflects only the part of economic activity that is produced and shared by Irish nationals. However, GDP is often used for comparisons with other EU countries and it is generally easier to measure. (ii) Calculate the MPS for this economy illustrated in the table above. (iii) Calculate the value of the multiplier in this open economy. (iv) How much will the Government have to inject into this economy if it wants the economy to operate at its full employment level? Show your workings. Solution: i)Marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the proportion of each extra unit of income that is not consumed/saved. ii) MPS = 1 - MPC = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 iii) 1 0.2 + 0.2 = 1 0.4 = 2.5 iv) Shortfall in national income: (EURO)820m -(EURO)600m = (EURO)220m So, the Government must increase spending by: (EURO)220m = (EURO)88m. 2.5 SAMPLE QUESTION: Irish economic growth has outpaced average EU growth rates in recent years, making Ireland the fastest growing economy in the EU. Discuss the factors that have contributed to Ireland's recent rates of economic growth. Solution: Increased consumer spending: due to decreasing unemployment rates (down to 6.1% in January 2018, from 7.1% 12 months previously) and job creation staying positive, low interest rates and more availability of credit, there is increased aggregate demand and spending in the economy, contributing to the level of economic growth. Increased investment: due to the very low interest rates in Ireland (as dictated by the ECB base interest rate of 0% at present) and low corporation tax (12.5%), there has been an increased level of indigenous and foreign investment in Ireland. Decreased saving: due to low interest rates and increasing consumer confidence, less people are saving and more people are spending and investing, contributing to the increased economic growth. Government fiscal policy: the 2015 budget was the first in seven years to introduce tax cuts and increased government spending and the 2016, 2017 and 2018 budgets have followed with the same approach. Tax cuts have increased disposable incomes and increased government expenditure is aimed towards public services which will aid economic growth. For example, the free pre-school for children before primary school scheme (now extended to two years), encourages more parents to work, therefore increasing aggregate demand. Corporation tax: by maintaining low levels of corporation tax (at 12.5%, Ireland's corporation tax is amongst the lowest in the world), Ireland has ensured it has continued to be a desirable location for indigenous and multinational companies to locate. This creates employment, increases aggregate demand and contributes to economic growth. Exports: Ireland's export sector has continued to grow, with a series of significant base metal deposits being made, including the giant ore deposit at Tara Mine. Zinc-lead ores are al",0,,,,,,
87,Irish Independent,17/12/2011,"All change in the Dail, but real test still to come","NO dissenting voices were heard -- for once -- yesterday when Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore announced the Dail would be shutting down for three and a half weeks.  After a gruelling year, coalition and opposition TDs alike were more than happy to see the end of 2011.  Taoiseach Enda Kenny had threatened earlier in the week to bring them in next week if there were any complaints from the Opposition about enough time not being given to debate legislation.  He called their bluff.  Ceann Comhairle Sean Barrett noted wryly he was afraid for a moment that Fianna Fail deputy leader Eamon O Cuiv wanted to extend the sitting period.  Not a chance.  Instead, Mr O Cuiv wanted to divulge some world-weary advice to the batch of new TDs.  ""I am sure all the new deputies now fully realise something they might not have realised this time last year, that public representatives have a heavy workload,"" he said.  ""The little break is more than well deserved and there is a lot of work to be done back home in the meantime.""  Sitting in for Micheal Martin, Mr O Cuiv was speaking directly across the Chamber from where he sat a year ago in the dying days of the old Fianna Fail and Green Party government.  He was flanked by a half dozen of his party colleagues, who survived the electorate's cull.  Rightfully, he mentioned the sad passing this year of Brian Lenihan, which left a void in so many ways.  What stands out most about the new Dail is the volume of Fine Gael TDs.  On a quiet morning yesterday, where nothing contentious was being discussed, 25 Fine Gael backbenchers were scattered across the government benches.  The volume in numbers translates into a volume of sound when their Taoiseach comes under attack from the opposition benches.  Martin and Gerry Adams literally find themselves being shouted down.  The visual transformationof Fine Gael is more striking because the Labour backbenchers are still sitting inthe same corner of the Dailthey occupied while in opposition.  The arrangement is simply down to the arrangement of the seats rather than a suggestion that the party is having it both ways in government and opposition at the same time.  Nine months on and the coalition parties are already down four TDs, without batting an eyelid.  Only nine months into the Dail term is too early to make any judgment on newly elected TDs. But Fine Gael and the Labour Party have reason to believe the class of 2011 is a new generation which will go on to become the future leaders of the parties.  Certainly there's no lack of ambition among the young buck TDs, but the ones with cop on know patience is required and ministerial office doesn't arrive overnight.  Pinning down the seat at the next general election is the primary challenge for any new TD worth their salt.  Politics is a long-term game.  Ironically, the current idol of the Fine Gael backbenches is a man who lead the party to its worst ever result -- an outcome which inadvertently created vacancies in constituencies for the younger TDs.  Almost a decade after presiding over the meltdown, Michael Noonan delivered his first Budget as Minister for Finance.  The wheel always turns.  The decline of Fianna Fail also saw the arrival of increased number of Sinn Fein TDs and a rejuvenation of the independent benches.  Mr Adams's impact has been limited but Sinn Fein has finally elected a coterie of young, articulate and capable performers -- even if the party's economic policies are still simplistic and lacking in credibility.  The result is the pressure to pass the torch of leadership will grow.  The independent benches have provided many colourful moments, but some of its numbers supply a lot of heat with very little light.  The diversity of views certainly provides a challenge for the Ceann Comhairle, but Sean Barrett's firm, no-nonsense style is fair to all and demands respect for the institution of the parliament.  But the break will be welcomed by all sides of the Dail after a hectic year.  Compared to the disarray and uncertainty of a year ago, the political system is vastly changed.  When the Dail reconvened in January 2011, the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen faced questions over his relationship with former Anglo Irish Bank chief Sean FitzPatrick after revelations of an infamous game of golf.  The absolute beginning of the very end was Mr Cowen's botched reshuffle amid some bizarre scenes in Leinster House of cabinet members trying to explain the logic of a zombie government trying to replenish.  Mr Cowen's exit just a few days later was inevitable, dignified and soon forgotten.  Following the shambolic final days of the previous regime, the arrival of a stable administration with the election of Enda Kenny as Taoiseach on March 9 came as a relief.  The seminal moment of the year almost happened before anybody noticed when the Taoiseach made his celebrated Cloyne Report speech without any advance fanfare and proceeded to criticise the Vatican's attitude on child abuse.  Although the new Dail brought about a change in personnel, the relevance of much of the business that takes place there is still in question.  2011 was a year that started with a bang and ended with a whimper.

88,Irish Independent,04/05/2015,All eyes on our near neighbour as the UK heads for cliffhanger,"IT'S a shorter than usual week this week, thanks to the bank holiday today. But one event is sure to be of interest to the business world, and that's the general election in the UK on Thursday. Polls have prime minister David Cameron's Conservatives roughly level with the Labour Party led by Ed Miliband, suggesting a coalition government is the most likely outcome. Mr Cameron's Liberal Democrat coalition partners have seen a collapse in support amid a surge in backing for the Scottish National Party, a challenge by the anti-European Union UK Independence Party, and the rise of the Greens. The economy is one of the most important issues in the election. Data released on Friday showed that British manufacturing growth slowed sharply in April, underlining the uneven nature of the economic recovery. Coming after a surprising slowdown in growth in the first quarter, the survey will have made for gloomy reading for Mr Cameron and chancellor George Osborne, who promised a manufacturing revival shortly after coming to power in 2010. And one of the big questions is if the Conservatives get back into power, could we end up potentially seeing a British exit from the EU? That uncertainty could result in market jitters. And yet, the leaders of 5,000 small companies have signed a letter endorsing the Conservative Party, saying they would like Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to have the chance to finish what they have started, the 'Daily Telegraph' reported last month. The letter, signed by firms from every region of the United Kingdom, says the Conservatives' commitment to low taxes has helped ""to get the economy moving again,"" creating 1,000 jobs a day since 2010, the newspaper reported. Elsewhere, the European Commission tomorrow publishes its spring European Economic Forecast, which will include projections for growth, inflation, unemployment and budget deficits. French finance minister Michel Sapin travels to Brussels on Thursday to discuss France's plans to cut its deficit and reform its economy. France has said it will target smaller reductions in its structural budget deficit in 2016 and 2017 than called for by the European Commission in order to preserve economic growth. And then there's Greece. The country is scheduled to make an interest payment to the International Monetary Fund of about (EURO)201m on Wednesday. Negotiators from Athens and Brussels are likely to continue talks as they seek to break an impasse over bailout aid amid conflicting signals from the country's government over its willingness to agree on longstalled reforms. Here at home, it's a relatively quiet week on the business front as well. A number of companies will publish interim management statements, including CRH and Kingspan. The Central Statistics Office, meanwhile, will publish the monthly services index tomorrow, and industrial production on Wednesday.

89,The Irish Times,13/12/2002,"All indicators point to state of chassis in 2003If the economy is going to record any respectable growth over the next year then the consumer will have to hang in there, writes Cliff Taylor, Economics Editor","Walking down Grafton Street this week I bumped into one of Dublin's more bullish economists. With a wave of his hand to point out the hordes of shoppers he exclaimed: ""Recession - what recession?"" And you had to admit he had a point. The street was thronged and the shops were busy. It will be some months before we have statistics on how retail spending performed at Christmas 2002. It is unlikely to match the mattress money madness of last year, but the signs so far are that spending is holding up well. 02121300157 For the sake of our economic prospects, we must hope that it continues to do so. If the economy is going to record any kind of respectable growth over the next year, then the consumer will have to hang in there. At this stage the jury is out on whether this will happen, with the Budget and rising inflation reducing spending power, and unemployment edging steadily higher. There are four main drivers of economic growth - consumer spending, government spending, investment and exports. The outlook for two of these looks decidedly shaky. First, the Government sector has strongly supported growth this year, through higher spending and rising employment. In its forecasts accompanying the Budget, the Department of Finance estimates that Government consumption spending rose by 8.9 per cent last year, but will ease back by 0.7 per cent next year. Not much impetus to growth from the public sector, then, which has been single-handedly supporting the jobs market over much of this year. The second sector which is unlikely to contribute much to growth next year is investment spending. This counts investment by both the public and private sectors. It eased by 0.3 per cent this year, the Department estimates, and is predicted to fall by 0.7 per cent next year, affected by falling Government spending in this area and a nervous climate for private business. So for growth next year we will be left to rely on the consumer and on exporting industry. The Department predicts that exports could rise by 5 per cent next year, taking advantage of a gradual recovery in the international economy. Can we can rely on the recovery? Here there are worrying signs. The World Bank in its latest forecast this week wrote that ""the global recovery is fragile"". A tentative recovery in early 2002 has more or less fizzled out, due to turbulence in financial markets and falling investment. The bank expects world GDP to rise by 2.5 per cent next year, after 1.7 per cent this year. However it warns that any further financial turbulence - or a temporary surge in oil prices due to war in Iraq - could easily reduce this to below 2 per cent. Looking at individual economies, Germany is in dreadful trouble and threatens to act as a brake on the big Continental euro zone bloc. Britain, still our biggest single market, is somewhat healthier, while the outlook in the US remains uncertain, with confidence severely hit by financial turbulence. Overall, our exporters face an uncertain and difficult outlook for 2003. It is also important to remember that Irish export figures have been affected by export surges in areas such as pharmaceuticals. These relate to the activities of multinationals here - and obviously benefit the economy through increased employment in particular. However, they have less of an economic impact than exports from the indigenous sector. Here the British market's health and the euro's health will be key factors. Any sharp rise in the euro's value could provide another burden to a sector already suffering from the increasing costs of doing business in Ireland. Which brings us back to the consumer. Here the Department is predicting a gradual pick-up from spending growth of 2.8 per cent last year to 2.9 per cent next year and 3.6 per cent in 2004. Whether this is correct will depend on that most brittle and unpredictable of factors - consumer confidence. We have just gone through a few boom years for the consumer. In the four years 1998-2001 consumer spending growth averaged about 9 per cent a year, driven by rising employment and sharp increases in disposable income. However next year employment growth will be modest at best and, in a Budget analysis, Goodbody Stockbrokers predicted that real (that is inflation adjusted) personal disposable income will rise by just 1.4 per cent next year, down from almost 4 per cent this year. So the boost to consumer spending from rising incomes will be much less marked than it has been in recent years. Just as important will be the ""mood music"" for consumers - they have seen a tough but by no means savage Budget. Could confidence be affected by war in Iraq? Or by some more bad news on the employment front? At the moment there is no reason to expect a collapse in consumer spending. It may well keep ticking upwards, supported by the strong gains of recent years, low interest rates and an international upturn in the latter part of the year. But it is clear the economy is entering a risky period. Growth has slowed very sharply over the past year or so and there are points of vulnerability in the economy - such as significant numbers of people who have borrowed very heavily to buy property. Statistically the first few months of 2003 may not measure as a recession - but it isn't going to seem too pretty to a populace accustomed to rapid growth.",1,security,iraq wars,,,,iraq
90,The Irish Times,13/01/2020,All the focus in politics now on the first fortnight in February,"The 32nd Dáil will have lasted almost four years by the time of the general election, a much longer period than most believed when the last election threw up its inconclusive result on February 26th, 2016.  Given the novel and at times fragile governing construct that contest threw up - Fianna Fáil underpinning a Fine Gael-led minority Government in a confidence-and-supply agreement - TDs have laboured for years in the belief that an election could come at any time. After those years of uncertainty, they now know an election will be held within weeks. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made his call and, while not being definitive, clearly indicated on RTÉ's This Week that he will dissolve the Dáil in the coming days for an early February general election.  The signs that Varadkar was moving in this direction were evident since before Christmas, when he began to carve out the space to allow himself to go to the country earlier than his previous suggested date of May 2020.  Impossible  He slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country.  He then asked the impossible of Micheál Martin, asking that the Fianna Fáil leader should get his TDs to actually vote with the Government rather than abstain, as outlined in the confidence-and-supply agreement.  Knowing his Fine Gael-minority government was on its last legs due to dwindling Dáil numbers, he prepared the ground for the announcement he is expected to make this week. Perhaps the Taoiseach was content to allow events of recent days - with Independent TDs shying away from supporting him and general uncertainty building momentum towards an election - play out.  The past week has brought Varadkar to the destination he had likely settled on weeks ago: a general election campaign he hopes will be bookended by Brexit, what he yesterday called ""the big job of this Government"". He will travel to Belfast today to meet British prime minister Boris Johnson, and Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, is in Dublin on Wednesday.  If Varadkar opts for a February 7th election date, the UK will leave the EU one week out from polling day, and the issue will feature heavily in the final week of the campaign, when many voters make up their minds.  The RTÉ interview offered some clues to how Varadkar will run the campaign: attacking Fianna Fáil on its record on the economy while offering praise for those he may hope to coax into coalition if he is successful in the election.  On the issue of hospital beds, he said Fine Gael had ""reversed"" the cuts in health implemented by Fianna Fáil between 2007 and 2011, and added that he had worked with Brendan Howlin in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of 2011-2016 to increase investment.  His interview also prompted action across political parties and among Independent TDs and candidates. Many TDs had already begun a heavy canvass schedule, but others had held back. Decisions on whether to actually run at all will also be made by others in the coming days, with two members of the Independent Alliance considering their future. Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath is understood to be consulting his family and local organisation on whether he will stand again in Dublin Bay North, with sources close to the political veteran saying he is ""50-50"".  Minister of State for Skills John Halligan is also said to be considering whether to retire from politics and not seek to hold on to his Waterford seat. Fianna Fáil is expected to make a few further ticket changes this week, such as the addition of a candidate in Cork North Central, and the party announced that Dara Calleary, its deputy leader, will be director of elections.  Fine Gael's executive council will also add more candidates in some constituencies as all political focus now turns to the first fortnight in February.",1,political,elections,,,,ireland
91,The Irish Times,11/05/2009,Alternative economic vision of Spirit of Ireland offers hope,"OPINION:The Spirit of Ireland economic revival proposal shows how we can pick ourselves up and get over this crisis, writes RAY KINSELLA IRELAND IS a chastened country. Successive economic forecasts provide confirmation of an implosion that is creating a vortex at the heart of our economy, and the wider society including public services which it underpins. On the external front, the contraction in world trade, together with the pressure on US foreign investment arising from Barack Obama s legislation, give additional impetus to this vortex which is swallowing up jobs, lives and domestic industry. It is not partisan, but only the hard reality, that the politics which have led us into this cul-de-sac are incapable of identifying a way forward. But, there is a way forward. Unlikely as it seems, we are being offered an opportunity to re-imagine the economy, and in doing so, restore both our confidence and our international standing. The announcement, by Graham O Donnell, of a new national energy initiative is transformational. It is based on our capacity to jointly harness Ireland s uniquely favourable wind-flow, and the potential for hydro-electric generation offered by ice-sculpted valleys running into the Atlantic. Nothing like this has been conceived before. The logo Spirit of Ireland does less than justice to what is envisaged which is reimagining how our economy and society could be. It is eminently clear from the critical mass of research, drawing on both Irish and international expertise, that this can be done, starting, more or less, now. The economics of the initiative are compelling. Ireland s economic future is inextricably bound up with the cost, and the security, of a stable and sustainable supply of energy in a form compliant with our responsibilities under the Kyoto protocol. The most recent (2008) National Competitiveness Report by Forfás highlights this reality:  This report highlights that Ireland is highly dependent on imported fossil fuels, which present a range of challenges . . . With respect to electricity cost competitiveness, Ireland ranks as the second most expensive country in the EU15 . . . Irish businesses and consumers are exposed to volatile and increasing international prices for oil and gas . . . Our reliance on imported fossil fuels endangers our security of supply and raises the carbon intensity of the Irish economy . . . Significant change will be required if we are to meet our Kyoto targets. Achieving our security of supply and environmental objectives in a fashion that does not further weaken our energy cost competitiveness is an acute challenge. * Electricity costs for Irish industry have risen inexorably over the last decade significantly faster than those of our trading competitors. They are now, according to the most recent data published by the Central Bank, the second highest in the EU15. The cost of electricity to households has followed a similar pattern they, too, are the second highest in the EU. The cost of imported fuel is some EUR 3 billion a year. The reality is that our capacity is inadequate, our costs excessive, and our whole generating infrastructure deficient and not aligned to our own indigenous energy capabilities. The Spirit of Ireland Initiative provides a robust platform for: ** Transforming Ireland s medium-term economic performance. ** Reducing uncertainty, which is at present imposing a severe economic penalty on business and Government, not least within a largely self-fixated banking model and foreign exchange markets that are, at best, indifferent. ** Restoring national morale and confidence in our ability, wholly against the odds, to innovate and, once again, provide a template for other countries to seek to emulate. ** Fiscal stabilisation, and greater certainty, will contribute to a restoration of Ireland s international reputation and policy credibility. ** Leveraging Ireland s Golden Demographics , which is one of its few embedded competitive advantages, compared with other EU and OECD countries. The initiative provides a compelling justification for pro-active investment in higher education, and for expanding, rather than closing down, skill-based third-level courses and research. It is worth emphasising that Central Statistic Office data suggests that the present demographics provide a unique window of opportunity which will close within 20 years, leading to significant increases in older, as well as the overall, dependency ratios. Furthermore, the funding would not represent a further burden on an exchequer running out of balance-sheet capacity. Instead it provides the means for progressively returning to fiscal stability and paying off the costs of fiscal and political profligacy. The initiative is not aspirational. It is rooted in established engineering and project management protocols. The scale of the project is vast. Downstream applications are limited only by the inventiveness of the Irish people. The first wave employment opportunities are in the tens of thousands the key constraint here being the commitment of the people of Ireland and, secondly, the willingness of the present political order to support it without any regard whatever to patronage, and still less to control. One of the terrible aspects of the recession has been the unravelling of expertise. Engineers are emigrating, whole classes of postgraduate students are seeking shelter within the third-level sector or setting aside their hard-won knowledge and capabilities. There is still time to reverse this process. We have the people with the necessary skills and with every incentive to engage proactively with this initiative. What is in prospect is a whole new wave of industries and specialised service providers, following on from the epic energy engineering core of the project itself. The scale of Spirit of Ireland is, prophetically, proportionate to that of the country s existing and even more so, prospective, problems. And all of this potential, which is waiting to be harnessed, is configured around natural endowments of air, water and the human creativity of one of the youngest populations within the OECD. It is, however, the proposed governance of the Spirit of Ireland initiative which truly sets it apart. The hubris that brought Ireland to its knees in the latter stages of the Celtic Tiger was characterised by societal fragmentation, driven by greed. We lost the run of ourselves and lost sight of our neighbour. Spirit of Ireland is the complete antithesis of this mindset. It proposes that the wealth in the form of energy, and all of the other activities that will be animated by this energy be held in trusteeship for the people of Ireland. The proposed legal framework envisages that the gifts of our natural resources are the legacy of this, and future, generations, and must remain so. The fruits of this initiative will not be privatised, or parcelled out for private or institutional interests. This far-sighted vision throws into sharp relief the extent to which our natural resources have, in the past, been sold out or sold cheaply. This is not a Government or even a political initiative. It is, quite simply, driven by the vision, tenacity and generosity of Graham O Donnell, a successful entrepreneur working in this field, co-operating with a gifted academic team led by Prof Igor Shvets. The integrity and clear-sightedness of the initiative has brought on board a wide range of Irish and international experts. The sole motivation of this team has been the interests of the people of Ireland, and the willingness to engage inclusively with all of the people in order to make it happen. This is the public good as a vital force in transforming, not just our energy supplies and our economic trajectory, but the whole manner in which Ireland, as a community, can function. That, surely, is transformational. The response to my recent article ( We ve screwed up, that s the truth of it April 23rd) which argued for a whole new political ethos found an extraordinary resonance across all ages and shades of political opinion. This response is embodied in the Spirit of Ireland initiative which is not just the only option open to us in our current bleak circumstances; it is the very best possible option. Spirit of Ireland puts our future firmly into the hands of the people of Ireland, and the onus for supporting and empowering this initiative on to the politicians of a political system which is passing.  *Source: National Competitiveness Report 2008 (Vol. I) 1.2.6.

92,The Irish Times,13/06/2003,An agenda for competitiveness,"The inflation rate fell to 3.7 per cent last month, a welcome decline which brings it to its lowest level since late 1999. The combination of falling energy costs and the impact of the rising euro on import prices appears to have set inflation on a downward trend, with most forecasters now expecting the rate to drop below 3 per cent by the end of the year. The outlook for modest economic growth, meanwhile, should ensure that excess demand does not put pressure on the general price level as we move into the new year. 03061300104 Causes for concern remain, however. While the inflation rate here is falling, it remains almost twice the EU average. Competitiveness here will thus continue to suffer, particularly if the euro makes further gains against sterling and the US dollar. Meanwhile, price pressures remain in areas of the economy, including parts of the services sector. Government policy now faces two challenges. One is not to do anything to reverse the downward inflation trend in the coming months. The wage terms for the final year and a half of the new national agreement will come up for negotiation as we move into next year and it is vital that the downward inflationary trend is maintained, to allow modest and competitive terms which will at the same time offer real gains to employees. The second challenge for policymakers is to tackle the lack of competitiveness remaining in some parts of the economy; this would make a key contribution to building an efficient and low-inflation economy in the long term. The decline in the Irish inflation rate also, unfortunately, reflects worrying international trends. Growth is low in all the main economies and inflationary pressures have eased to such an extent that deflation - or a period of generally falling prices - is now a threat. The European Central Bank yesterday forecast that the euro zone economy would grow by less than 1 per cent for the second year in a row. Meanwhile, the outlook for the US economy is also uncertain, due in no small part to its rising current account balance of payments deficit. These trends suggest that the next few months will offer little in the way of good news for the Irish economy. Growth is likely to remain subdued and a further sustained rise in the value of the euro would threaten the jobs market, which so far has performed remarkably solidly. This uncertain international backdrop makes it all the more important that the Government does what it can to stabilise inflation at a relatively low level in the coming months and presses ahead with an agenda of building competitiveness and ensuring value for money and efficiency in the provision of public services.",0,,,,,,
93,The Irish Times,08/03/2001,An Election Budget,"The British chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, has paved the way for an election with a relatively generous budget which targeted tax reductions at families and the low-paid and extra spending to health and education. While the Conservative party leader, Mr William Hague, quickly dismissed the package as a ""cynical election budget"", Mr Brown did not, in fact, throw caution to the wind. He provided some benefit for most voters, but was still able to forecast a budget surplus for the 2001/2002 fiscal year of (pounds) 23 billion sterling. He was able to do this because steady growth has boosted tax revenues, giving him considerable room for manoeuvre. 01030800107 The date of the general election remains uncertain; May 3rd remains the favoured date, shortly after the Budget tax concessions become effective in mid-April. Mr Brown tried to press all the right buttons in his package, offering a modest reduction to all taxpayers by widening the tax band for the low 10 per cent income tax rate. In what he put forward as a ""families first"" package he significantly boosted maternity leave and benefits and increased tax relief for families with children. On the spending side, he provided (pounds) 1 billion extra for both health and education, while also introducing a range of new measures to encourage enterprise. The overall message was that the Labour government would keep Britain on a steady growth path, escaping the traditional boom to bust cycle. With the election now just a couple of months away, the economic outlook for the Labour government is good. The economy should grow by 2.5 to 3 per cent this year, unemployment is low and inflation is subdued. Britain can reasonably hope to avoid any major difficulties from the downturn in the US, although the Bank of England may choose soon to reduce interest rates again to give growth a modest boost due to the poorer international environment. The issue of whether - and when - Britain will enter the euro zone will no doubt be an election issue. While the Conservatives will try to focus on this issue, Labour will stick to its mantra that the decision to hold a referendum will only be made when the various tests set down for entry are met. For Ireland, the outlook for steady growth in the British economy is welcome. With growth starting to ease in the US, our exporters will hope to target Britain and the Continental European economies instead. An early decision to bring sterling into the euro zone would also be good news for our economy and would do much to encourage additional trade and investment across the Border. It remains to be seen, however, whether the likely timing of such a move will become clear shortly after the election. Mr Blair - odds on to return to Number 10 Downing Street - has indicated that the issue could be dealt with in the first two years of the new parliament, but even if the vote was then for entry, it would still be some years before sterling entered the euro zone. So while exporters can probably count on a benign outlook for the British market, they will still have to cope with the uncertainties of currency swings for some years to come.",0,,,,,,
94,Irish Independent,07/10/2020,An era of economic inequality awaits if hospitality industry is allowed to collapse; WEDNESDAY INSIGHT,"ONE of Ireland's most important industries faces a reckoning that is fast approaching. An urgent response is needed. This response is even more urgent as the country moves to Level 3 of the Government's Covid-19 roadmap, while Dublin is set to remain at Level 3 for up to six weeks. Nearly 8pc of the entire country is employed in what the Central Statistics Office (CSO) defines as the 'accommodation and food services' sector, which includes your local pub, restaurant, and hotel. However, according to projections by the drinks and hospitality industry - based on the Department of Business, Enterprise, and Innovation's own analysis - almost twothirds of those jobs, 114,000 in total, could be lost by the end of 2020 and early 2021 unless Government recognises and responds to the situation. Some regions are particularly vulnerable. In the southwest, for example, as many as 19,000 jobs are at risk. In Kerry alone, the sector employs 10.5pc of workers. Last week, updated forecasts by the Department of Finance substantiate these concerns. In a pre-Budget forecast, the Department signalled a looming jobs crisis in the domestic economy. While the multinational sector is flourishing, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has acknowledged Ireland's ""dual economy"", which he says ""has become even more apparent during this pandemic"". CSO data for the first two quarters of 2020 hinted at its existence. In Q2 2020, the volume of total gross value added (which is similar to GDP) dropped by a modest 2.2pc compared with 2019, but the distribution, transport, hotels, bars, and restaurants sector dropped by 32pc. Employment is the better indicator of the negative economic impact of Covid-19. A collapse of the hospitality industry will have a disproportionate effect on the economy and serve to widen this division, particularly among groups like our young workers. Take, for example, the effect on the 15-24 age group, who make up nearly a third of all accommodation and food service employment. And on women, who make up more than half of employees (and more than two-thirds in the midlands and south-east). In a typical recession, emigration can give younger people a second chance at a career and financial independence. But with travel restrictions and lockdowns, school leavers and university graduates are now effectively confined to home with few short-term prospects. Everyone has felt the hardship of the last six months, socially, psychologically, and materially. Most businesses are worse off than they were in 2019, those in the drinks and hospitality industry especially. Pubs, hotels, and restaurants depend on the free movement and congregation of people, which are of course now greatly reduced, and on foreign tourism, which is practically non-existent. Ireland's so-called 'wet pubs', the 60pc that do not serve food, have had it hardest of all. These businesses were shut - dependent on social welfare payments for a wage while still having to meet fixed costs - for over six months and are now reopening into a world of restrictions, reduced operating hours, and general uncertainty. A recent survey of publicans showed that almost half took on (EURO)16,000 in debt during lockdown to cover staff and business costs, one in five as much as (EURO)30,000. Dublin publicans, whose businesses have been caught in the Government's costly and unpredictable stop-start lockdown strategy, will endure further financial strain for the next period of weeks. Or it could be months - no one knows. The K-shaped recovery Over the last year, you may have heard academics and politicians talk of L, U, V, and W-shaped economic recoveries, whereby lines on a graph indicating GDP dips and rises broadly take on these shapes. But in a ""K-shaped"" recovery, where the K's strokes indicate divergent fortunes for different segments of the workforce. Workers on the upward stroke - those in professional services, technology, and online retail - recover to acceptable levels as lockdown restrictions are lifted. But those on the downward stroke, in industries like hospitality and tourism, do not. While remote working has been a welcome revolution for many, not everyone can do their job from a laptop. The CSO's Q2 Labour Force Survey shows that the number of people in professional and technical occupations actually increased during lockdown compared to the same period in 2019, but ""elementary"" occupations, such as kitchen, and cleaning jobs, fell by a quarter. There is much at stake. For many people, a job in the drinks and hospitality industry is a rewarding, lifelong career. For others, like students and homemakers, it offers flexibility to work part-time hours, providing an additional earnings opportunity that supports lifestyles and, in many cases, facilitates wider responsibilities. If a downturn in the industry means these people lose their jobs, we face years of increased economic inequality between the lower-skilled and the high-tech professional. Regional inequality would deepen, too. In many places, especially small towns and villages, work in drinks and hospitality businesses is one of the few forms of employment available. If these business fold, their communities fold with them. The fortunes of Ireland's pubs, hotels, and restaurants are inextricably wound up with those of the ""experience economy"", like live events and tourism. A fast recovery is good for both, while a slow decline will spread unemployment and bankruptcy on a much larger scale. Make it easier for us to do business Short of a time machine, no one single action, political or scientific, can undo the culmination of events of the last year. Drinks and hospitality business owners understand that they have a difficult period ahead of them. However, the Government can take direct, practical steps now to minimise economic hardship and save jobs. That means removing barriers to doing business. Take excise. Ireland's consumers and drinks and hospitality businesses pay the second-highest excise tax on drinks in the EU. These rates are punitive, and they directly undermine a crucial employer, tourism product, and growing export business. In a commercial environment where restaurants are operating at 60pc capacity, pubs at 50pc, and hotels at 25pc, every cent saved counts. With a reduction in costs, publicans, hoteliers, restaurateurs, brewers, and distillers can spend more money keeping staff employed, paying off debt accrued during lockdown, and preparing their business for a tough economic period. None of us can take Covid-19 lightly. Face masks and Perspex screens are here to stay until there is a vaccine or some other effective therapy. Drinks and hospitality businesses know this, and that is why they have invested thousands of euro - some, tens of thousands - to protect their staff and customers and keep their doors open. We must go on regardless. Businesses must stay open as much as possible and wages must be paid. What we need now is a clear plan, built in close collaboration with the Government. This plan must provide short-term support while the industry reopens and prioritise its medium and longterm recovery. If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste want to help our pubs, our restaurants, our hotels, our burgeoning micro-brewing and distilling industries, and all the jobs they support, then they must act now, in this Budget, and implement a package of consistent, predictable, and easily accessed business support measures. By next year it may be too late. Tony Foley is an economist and lecturer at DCU Business School.

95,The Irish Times,02/06/2021,An outlook filled with uncertainty; Economic recovery plan,"The Government's plan for economic recovery is an important step for the Coalition, providing some clarity on what's ahead after the pandemic, or at least after its most serious phase. Inevitably, it must be couched in terms that involve some uncertainty. We can hope that the worst of the restrictions are behind us, but we cannot be sure and the Government is correct to frame its strategy with this in mind. The Covid-19 emergency supports were, as the name suggests, always going to be temporary. The strategy to start winding them down in the autumn is reasonable, as is the commitment to continue them in reduced form up to the end of the year. If restrictions have to be reimposed, a rethink might be necessary. And the Government must deliver on its promise to put in new and extensive supports to help people who have lost work permanently to get back into employment. Businesses will welcome the continuation of wage subsidies and a range of other supports, including new sectoral programmes and restart assistance. The Government faces a difficult job in helping viable companies to restart and rehire - the reality is that while most will succeed, there are some that will not. In some cases this will be because of changes in their sectors, with patterns of demand and spending unlikely to return to previous levels. There will be new opportunities, but also sectors which face ongoing problems.  The Government has spent heavily over the past year and this will continue, albeit on a reduced basis. Spending big was the right approach, even if withdrawing support is difficult and contentious.  The document provides some pointers to longer-term strategy in areas such as transport and the environment and to the likelihood of greater social protections post-pandemic.  There are also pointers about how these might be paid for. The Government hopes that a quick rebound in the economy may help to allow the pandemic debt to be managed in the years ahead. However, funding will be needed for new social supports and for permanently higher spending in areas such as health and social protection. There are suggestions of a rise in PRSI payments and details will be announced today of a reform of the local property tax, leading to a slightly higher yield. The latter, while it will lead to controversy, is an overdue reform and underpins a widening of the tax base introduced after the last crisis. Missing from the plan is a wider strategy for the public finances. This may come in the Summer Economic Statement from the Department of Finance. The new commission on welfare and tax, due to report next summer, also has a big agenda. Some shape is starting to appear on the post-pandemic economic agenda. Let's hope now that the prospects for this can be boosted by a relatively smooth reopening.",1,fiscal,covid,,,,ireland
96,The Irish Times,09/12/2011,An over-cautious budget approach,"THE STATE and its agencies will spend EUR 68.5 billion next year, according to this week s Budget. Total revenue is expected to amount to EUR 54.9 billion. If both targets are met, the general government budget deficit will fall from EUR 15.6 billion this year to EUR 13.6 billion in 2012. This will amount to the fifth consecutive year of unsustainably large gaps between the State s income and its outlay. These accumulated deficits, which are considerably larger than the bank rescue costs, but greatly exacerbated by them, have locked the State out of the bond market and forced it to depend on charity. Eliminating deficits and cutting the mountain of public debt to a sustainable level will take at least a decade, but if the Government can meet its targets for next year there is a good chance that it will convince the world that it is on the right path. It is still possible that the State s creditworthiness will be sufficiently improved to begin the process of weaning itself off bailout funds and back to normal market funding. But in common with households and businesses budgeting for the year ahead, the Government faces a great deal of uncertainty. Even in the four weeks between the time the Coalition agreed the size of the budgetary adjustment in early November and the finalisation of the detail on how this adjustment would be achieved this week, the skies over Europe darkened. Growth has halted. The banking system is at risk of cardiac arrest. Concerns for the future of the euro have reached new heights. The risk of recession or worse is real. Even if the Government meets both its spending and revenue targets next year, its forecast for gross domestic product, of 2.5 per cent in cash terms and 1.3 per cent when adjusted for inflation, will have to be reached, otherwise the budget deficit (of EUR 13.6 billion) will exceed 8.6 per cent of GDP the upper limit allowed under the terms of the EU-IMF bailout and, incidentally, by far the highest projected deficit among the 27 countries of the EU. Given the deteriorating external conditions in Europe, including in our single largest trading partner, Britain, the economic forecasts underpinning Budget 2012 look more optimistic almost by the day. It may be that resolution of the euro crisis today unleashes a return to growth across the Continent. But even if EU leaders take measures that are convincing and hopes that they will do so have dimmed over the course of the week it is likely that some time will be required before economic momentum returns. More likely still is that the euro crisis will rumble on into the new year. Given these uncertainties the Government was too cautious in the size of the adjustment. Ireland s budget adjustment next year is considerably smaller than those of either Greece or Portugal, the other two euro area member states being bailed out. There was and is scope to take more aggressive action to shrink the deficit. But ultimately, whether Budget 2012 succeeds in meeting its deficit target will depend more than anything else on economic growth. At this juncture missing the target seems more likely than meeting it.",1,fiscal,budget,,,,ireland
97,The Irish Times,11/07/2013,An uncertain outlook,"If short-term economic forecasting is difficult, given frequent revisions to the projected annual growth rate of the economy, medium-term forecasting to 2020 might seem like a wasteful exercise in pure speculation. Nevertheless, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has been right to offer a medium-term view of the outlook for the Irish economy over the next six years. And it uses three different scenarios for the economy to examine the potential challenges ahead, and to help inform a wider public debate. In the ESRI's dream scenario, where growth in the EU economy recovers at a reasonable rate, the Irish economy could enjoy a 3.5 per cent annual growth rate by the end of the decade, with the level of unemployment more than halving. In its nightmare scenario, the EU economy fails to recover and stagnation prevails. In such a situation, the domestic economy would struggle to grow at 1 per cent a year and, by 2020, the unemployment rate would be no lower than today. While under another malign scenario, where the EU economy recovered but domestic policy failed to respond and the economy underperformed, fiscal tightening (spending cuts and tax rises) would again be needed to stabilise public debt.  The wide range of scenarios outlined by the ESRI reflects the very uncertain outlook for the world economy. Given that background, the ESRI recommends that the Government fully implements the planned EUR 3.1 billion in spending and tax adjustments in the forthcoming budget in October. Doing it now, the ESRI claims, is an easier and less risky option than deferring some of the tax and spending adjustments until later, when economic conditions may have deteriorated. The ESRI's view, however, remains at odds with Ibec, the employers group, and the trade unions. While both employers and unions agree on using some of the EUR 1 billion in interest savings on the promissory note deal to reduce austerity measures in the budget, they disagree on how to do it. While Minister of Finance, Michael Noonan, has remained non-committal on the issue, saying it will not be considered before mid-September.  In the meantime, as Ireland prepares to exit the bailout programme at year-end, Mr Noonan now proposes to discuss exit strategies with the troika of international lenders. This is to ensure that after the bailout Ireland retains access to market funding at low interest rates. But whether that will require the Government to take out some insurance against any sudden loss of market confidence, via a reserve line of credit for use in a financial emergency, has yet to be decided. The result of those discussions will also have a bearing on whether the Government has scope to ease up on austerity in the next budget, and whether it can safely do so without losing credibility with financial markets at a critical time.

98,The Irish Times,22/04/2003,An uncertain world,"For some months speculation about a war in Iraq, followed by nervousness about its outcome, have held back the international economy. Understandably, businesses were loath to commit to major investment projects when faced with such a climate of uncertainty, while consumer confidence was also hit. Now, the question is whether the end of the war heralds an international upturn. The answer is not clear. The outlook for the US economy remains uncertain, although the end of the war should boost consumer and business confidence. Continental EU economies remain in poor shape, particularly Germany where deflation is a real threat. Meanwhile, the Far East has been hit by the SARS virus, while the Japanese economy remains in trouble. 03042200091 In the months ahead it is essential that policymakers do all in their power to promote recovery. The agenda they face is imposing and the diplomatic fall-out from the war will not help in some key areas. In the US, a key responsibility rests on President Bush, whose tax-cutting strategy faces political difficulties. Faced with Congressional opposition to its original plan, the task for the administration is to come forward with a programme which mixes stimulus with a longer-term strategy to control the federal deficit. The task facing European policymakers is even greater. In Germany, the Schroeder government is bringing forward economic reform plans. However there is a long way to go in deciding and - crucially - implementing a strategy. Meanwhile, it is long past time that the European Central Bank acted to offset the risks facing the euro zone economy. Last December it announced a half point interest rate cut, but it has not reduced rates since then and it is not now clear that it intends to do so. Lower interest rates are required without further delay to promote EU recovery. The risk of a growth slump is now much greater than any inflationary threat. Finally, there is one area which transcends international boundaries - trade. The Doha round being conducted under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation is in trouble, caught by old disagreements over agriculture and new trans-Atlantic diplomatic tensions. A breakthrough is essential if a key meeting of trade ministers in September is to give some impetus to the round. Progress will require flexibility on all sides, including a strategy to reduce supports to agriculture. However, if the compromises are not made and the round fails, the damage to already fragile business confidence will take a heavy toll on the longer-term growth outlook.",1,security,iraq wars,,,,ireland
99,The Irish Times,28/06/2013,Anglo bankers believed they could force an outcome at expense of State; Leaked recordings reveal bankers thought they could fool the regulators,"The aggressive stance taken by Anglo Irish Bank chief executive David Drumm with regulators, which emerges in the latest tape recordings of conversations within Anglo at the time of the 2008 bank guarantee, shows a banker under increasing pressure to save his institution and resorting to desperate tactics as the bank edged towards collapse. Drumm's conversations with the bank's head of capital markets John Bowe, recorded on Bowe's telephone line in Anglo's treasury department, took place against the background of a run on the bank's deposits and almost daily meetings with the regulator to respond to the deepening crisis of September 2008. US bank Lehman Brothers had just gone bankrupt sending the financial markets into a tailspin as corporate depositors - big companies spreading large cash deposits around various banks - decided that Anglo was too risky a bet and sought the return of their money as the deposit terms matured. The conversation between Drumm and Bowe on September 19th, 2008, is focused on how, at Anglo's next meeting with the Central Bank and financial regulator, the bank could increase the pressure on regulators to agree to lend EUR 7 billion to cover the amount of deposits lost, though - as Bowe himself acknowledged in a telephone call the previous day - the amount was likely to be higher. One aspect of the detail within the conversations that has been lost in the coverage of these new recordings is that during the telephone conversations the Anglo bankers were discussing a EUR 7 billion liquidity bailout to help the bank fund itself, they did not consider at the time - either due to incompetence or self-delusion or both - that a capital bailout to cover losses on loans was necessary.Black holeAs far as the bankers were concerned they were just dealing with a run on their deposits, not a black hole in their loan book, and were trying to get the regulators to act.  The EUR 29 billion bailout of public money that the Government is pumping into the bank was eventually provided for bad customer loans. The September 19th call shows the ""Drummer"" acknowledging that it was just a matter of days before the bank would run out of money.  Meetings between all of the Irish banks and the regulators became more intense following the collapse of Lehman Brothers on the weekend of September 14th-15th. That week's discussions between Anglo and the regulator marked a turning point as the crisis deepened for Anglo in particular.  For the first time, Anglo had requested a specific sum of cash in liquidity support from the Central Bank - backed by loans on the bank's books and a promissory note as collateral. This, the bank believed privately at the time as the tapes show, would turn the tables on the regulator, forcing the Central Bank and financial regulator to consider making a big call.'We need the moolah' ""Get into the f***ing simple speak: 'We need the moolah, you have it, so you're going to give it to us and when would that be?' We'll start there,"" Drumm tells Bowe about the strategy that they would pursue in their next meeting with the Central Bank and the financial regulator. The strategy was to hit the ball back into the regulator's court. ""The game has changed now because really the problem now is at their door,"" Drumm told Bowe. ""Because if they don't give it to us on Monday they have a bank collapse."" In the end the strategy failed, forcing Anglo chairman Se^on FitzPatrick and chief executive Drumm out of desperation to doorstep Central Bank director, economist Alan Gray - who they knew had the ear of taoiseach Brian Cowen as an adviser - at his offices in Dublin the following week to impress upon him the seriousness of the crisis and the need for an urgent solution to save the bank. The Central Bank procrastinated for more than a week but did eventually provide some short-term support to Anglo - in the order of a loan of about EUR 1 billion - to tide the bank over on Monday, September 29th when it ran out of cash. Ultimately, the government stepped in with the blunderbuss approach to try to stem the run on Anglo with the EUR 440 billion guarantee for the wider banking system, a gamble the government lost. Patrick Honohan, now governor of the Central Bank, explored the reasons why the Central Bank chose not to provide a large emergency loan to Anglo in late September 2008 - a possible short-term solution to the banking crisis - when he investigated the causes of the banking crisis in his May 2010 report.  He concluded that if an emergency loan was given to Anglo, the Central Bank may have been forced to provide emergency loans to the entire banking system, which would have been damaging for the entire system, and that the Central Bank was uncertain whether an emergency loan to Anglo, whether publicly disclosed or detected, would ""boost or detract"" from market confidence.  The Central Bank was also seriously concerned about the potential open-ended size of emergency loans and the associated risks for the regulators, he said. So the regulator may well have been aware of the potential outcome in the bank's strategy devised by Bowe in the earlier call - that Anglo could demand a certain amount of support from the Central Bank, namely EUR 7 billion, get the State on the hook and then ""creep up"" the amount demanded from the Central Bank as the bank required it. The most revealing aspect of the series of leaked telephone recordings, published in the Irish Independent this week, is the belligerent tone and expletive-ridden aggression of the conversations and what they say about Anglo's culture - that these bankers believed they could play with the regulators and pull the wool over their eyes to force an outcome at the expense of the State.Drumm's conversations The tenor of Drumm's conversations and his behaviour also show how the chief executive sets the tone in the bank and this is reflected in how his underlings spoke. Drumm's salty language, Bowe's mischievous reciting of the German national anthem, the disregard for the government and the regulator's wishes that the bank guarantee not be abused and the ribbing of regulators Pat Neary and Con Horan during the telephone calls was typical of the gallows humour and desperation within Anglo during its final weeks and months. Two months earlier when Rabobank in the Netherlands declined a frantic request from Anglo to take it over, Drumm disparaged the Dutch bankers in a private email to a colleague, describing them as ""windmill-lovin' clog-wearin' MOFOs"".'Doombuster Party'Two weeks before the September telephone calls, Drumm sent an email out to staff inviting them to his ""Back To School Doombuster Party"" early that month to try to lift their spirits and put up a brave front. ""The stock markets are down,"" he wrote in the invite to staff. ""They say the economy is in recession. It rained most of the 'summer'. The holidays are over. This is Anglo so there is only one thing to do - party!"" A hefty bill was incurred on food, drinks and entertainment for a party reminiscent of the last days of Rome. Almost five years, putting EUR 29 billion of public money into Anglo and biting austerity later, the sick jokes still emerging in this painful tragi-comedy are very much on the Irish people.

100,Irish Independent,13/08/2010,Anglo blamed as cost of debt doubles,"A SHOCK doubling in the cost of some government borrowing yesterday has been blamed on uncertainty about the final cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank.  But the government agency in charge of the national debt is determined to go ahead with a more significant fundraising next Tuesday -- despite yesterday's worrying rise.  The monthly borrowing of up to EUR1.5bn will now be watched closely next week to see if there has been a real fall in Ireland's credit rating.  The shock came when lenders demanded an average rate of almost 2.5pc on short-term loans due for repayment in February. This compared with a rate of just under 1.4pc for similar loans only three weeks ago.  Shock  The European Central Bank bought Irish government loans yesterday, according to reports on the financial news service Bloomberg, in what will be seen as a move aimed at easing market strains.  Yesterday's expensive fund-raising came a day after news that yet more money might have to go into Anglo Irish Bank than had previously been estimated.  The governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, has described the rates now being demanded for government borrowing as ""ridiculous"" and said they ""are a setback for our hopes of a narrowing to reflect the fiscal credibility of the country"".  A Central Bank source said yesterday that Dr Honohan stood by his words, despite yesterday's sharp rise in debt yields.  Borrowing costs for Ireland and Portugal have been rising steadily, after a short-lived fall when EU stress tests of banks were published last month.  The more important 10-year loans are costing more than 5pc -- an annual rate which is about as fast as the economy can possibly be expected to grow.  Lenders are worried about budget deficits in both countries and about budgets and banking costs in Ireland.  They fear EU statisticians will insist that the 10-year bill for rescuing Anglo is all recorded on this year's government accounts -- producing a deficit of more than 20pc of output (GDP).  Growing political opposition to more spending cuts will also raise questions in the minds of international banks that lend to the Government.  ""There is a danger that markets get spooked and demand rates well in excess of 5pc at next week's fundraising,"" said Brian Lucey, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Business School.  He added: ""Anything much over 5pc is dangerous territory.""  Markets are also worried about EUR80bn in loans which Irish banks are due to repay and replace with fresh borrowings in the next few months  The new debt will be guaranteed by the State, but no one can see when the State might be free of these liabilities.  ""One wouldn't read too much into what happens in quiet August days,"" said Rossa White, economist at Davy Research.  He added: ""But there will be no major progress until we get EU decisions on the Anglo restructuring plan and move beyond that.""  Nick Stamenkovic, a strategist at RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh, said: ""Irish debt is currently in the firing line because of concern over the fate of the country's banks and its implication on government finances.  ""Investors are going to demand higher risk premiums.""  The National Treasury Management Agency believes that cancelling next Tuesday's monthly fundraising would be seen as a panic measure.  It will therefore auction four-year loans and 10-year loans at the best interest rate it can get. ",1,monetary,anglo irish bank,,,,ireland
101,The Irish Times,31/12/2009,Annus horribilis for Irish banks,"With each passing month things got worse for Irish banks and their handling of the crisis often did not go down well with the public or the Government, writes SIMON CARSWELL, Finance Correspondent THE GOVERNMENT may have restarted the oxygen of funding to the banking sector with the emergency State guarantee in September 2008, but fears that the banks had potentially fatal levels of capital to protect against rising losses lingered as 2009 began. Just before Christmas 2008, the third largest domestic lender, Anglo Irish Bank, revealed that former chief executive Seán FitzPatrick had hidden loans of up to EUR 122 million over eight years. The scandal forced out FitzPatrick as chairman and then David Drumm, his successor as chief executive. The year started with another emerging crisis and ended with all but one of the six domestic lenders still desperately low on capital and the sector facing a much greater level of State ownership in 2010. JANUARY Anglo s finance director Willie McAteer, the bank s third in command, followed FitzPatrick and Drumm out the door in early January. The Irish banking crisis was three months old at this stage, yet the three Anglo executives were the only bankers to have resigned. It emerged that the Financial Regulator knew of FitzPatrick s loans that he had been temporarily hiding in Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) over the years. The loans were detailed in the bank s quarterly reports to the regulator. The regulator s chief executive Pat Neary already under pressure for his repeated assurances throughout 2008 that the Irish banks were adequately capitalised announced his departure. By the late evening of Thursday, January 15th, the strain on Anglo became too great and the Government was forced to take the bank into full State ownership, blaming the serious reputational damage to the bank caused by the controversy over FitzPatrick s loans. Brian Goggin said he would step down as Bank of Ireland chief executive in the summer after the bank decided to accept a State capital bailout and due to the bank s collapsing share price. His departure was expedited after he proclaimed to RTÉ that, following a voluntary pay cut, he would earn less than EUR 2 million for the current financial year. FEBRUARY The nationalisation of Anglo spooked investors creating uncertainty that the Government may have to take over other banks. Further controversies came thick and heavy as it emerged that Irish Life Permanent (ILP) had moved deposits of EUR 7.45 billion into Anglo for several days over the latter bank s previous September 30th financial year end. The deposits falsely flattered Anglo s balance sheet at a time of severe volatility and made the bank appear much stronger than it was on a day when investors were closely scrutinising its books. Anglo claimed the lodgements were customer deposits, while ILP argued they were inter-bank deposits backed by funds originating from Anglo. This is now the subject of investigations by the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement Paul Appleby. ILP had argued that the move had been encouraged by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank as part of a green jersey agenda to encourage Irish banks to support one another through the liquidity crisis of 2008. The regulator said that it was unaware of the precise nature of the arrangements in advance and that, while it would have encouraged interbanking lending, it could not support the nature of the transfers, which masked Anglo s heavy losses of customer deposits. It emerged that the regulator became aware of the transactions a month after they took place, but failed to raise any issue until mid-January. Despite differing accounts over who knew what and when, ILP chairwoman Gillian Bowler admitted the deposits were wrong and regretted that they had happened. ILP s board met and accepted the resignations of finance director Peter Fitzpatrick and head of treasury David Gantly, and later chief executive Denis Casey. By this stage, three Irish bank chief executives had resigned. During the same week, the Government announced a revision of its pre-Christmas recapitalisation plan, saying it would inject EUR 3.5 billion each into Allied Irish Banks (AIB) and Bank of Ireland, for 25 per cent preference share stakes. Soon afterwards, Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan sought to remove the banks most toxic loans the EUR 60 billion in loans to developers against which banks were taking heavy losses. The Government enlisted economist Peter Bacon to devise a bad bank plan to cleanse the lenders. Dr Michael Walsh resigned as Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS) chairman on February 17th as further revelations emerged about FitzPatrick s bed and breakfast loan arrangement to hide his borrowings at Anglo. Anglo s long-awaited annual report for the year to September 30th, 2008 when the bank teetered on the brink was published late the following Friday with a report by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). They provided fascinating details into the bank s financial position the previous autumn and its wild lending. The PwC report showed just how close Anglo was to going bust. Anglo had lost EUR 10 billion in deposits in September 2008 and was facing a negative cash position of EUR 12 billion by mid-October. The heavily edited report found that the bank had very large exposures about 15 customers with loans of more than EUR 500 million each. It was a case of a having far too many eggs in a very fragile basket. The bank also said in its annual report that it would have to write off EUR 300 million in loans provided to 10 long-standing customers who had purchased a 10 per cent stake in the bank during the summer of 2008 to prop up the share price. The so-called Golden Circle transaction, known within Anglo as the Maple transaction, arose after businessman Seán Quinn decided to convert an indirect 25 per cent stake in the bank into a direct shareholding of only 15 per cent. This left an overhang of 10 per cent of the bank s shares, which, if left to the open market, would lead to the stock plummeting, sounding alarm bells about the stability of Anglo. The secret share deal is the third strand of the official inquiries taking place at Anglo. At the end of the month Richie Boucher, an internal candidate and former head of Bank of Ireland s Irish retail operations, was appointed to succeed Goggin. The appointment drew criticism from several quarters, including financier Dermot Desmond, who said that a person who helped create the bank s problems should not be charged with solving them. MARCH As bank shares fell to record lows, Lenihan issued assurances that outflows of deposits at the two main banks was nothing to worry about. This did little to ease the growing pressure on the banks funding as the system came under a level of stress last experienced the previous September. This had a knock-on effect, driving up the Government s borrowing costs to the most expensive level recorded in a decade compared with German debt. The month started with troubling 2008 annual results from the State s largest bank, AIB. Heavy write-downs on Irish development loans forced the bank s Irish operation into its first loss since the bank was established in 1966. Chief executive Eugene Sheehy refused to resign, saying that he planned to lead AIB through the crisis. He said that the bank had believed there would be a soft landing in the economy. AIB said it could write off EUR 8.5 billion on bad loans over three years and, with the EUR 3.5 billion taxpayer bailout, would still have enough capital to survive the recession. The crisis claimed more casualties as the chairman and finance director of the Educational Building Society (EBS) resigned after the customer-owned lender, a minnow in property development lending, made a loss of EUR 38 million for 2008 as a result of these loans. Three days later, the Government committee on bankers pay, dropped another bombshell. Michael Fingleton, the chief executive of INBS, the State s other building society, had been paid a EUR 1 million bonus in November 2008, just weeks after the society secured protection under the State guarantee. Fingleton said that he was contractually entitled to the bonus which had been agreed in early 2008. It subsequently emerged that he was also the sole beneficiary of a EUR 27 million pension. By late March, the Government had taken Peter Bacon s advice and started preparations to establish a bad loans agency to cleanse the banks of their toxic assets. APRIL The mounting pressure on Fingleton became too much and he agreed to step down, promising to repay his bonus to INBS. As the year comes to a close, the society has to yet to be repaid. Fingleton became the fourth bank chief executive to step down; only Eugene Sheehy at AIB and Fergus Murphy at EBS remained. The Government s emergency budget of April 7th was dominated by the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) which would buy up to EUR 90 billion in development and associated loans at a discount. Dr Bacon said this would remove uncertainty about the banks capital requirements, while Lenihan said the economy could not sustain banks postponing losses on property loans. The Minister refused to say how much the Government would pay for the loans but that, if the purchases led to losses and the banks needed more capital, the State would take majority stakes. AIB reluctantly accepted that the State s EUR 3.5 billion would not be enough to absorb future losses and agreed to raise a further EUR 1.5 billion after a more severe stress test by the Government. The admission spelt the end for AIB s three most senior bankers. After surviving seven months of the crisis, AIB chairman Dermot Gleeson, chief executive Eugene Sheehy and finance chief John O Donnell agreed to stand down. The bank had stubbornly resisted State aid and then twice increased the capital that it needed, all the time refusing to contemplate management changes until large shareholders threatened to withdraw support. MAY Two weeks later, their humiliation was complete when a shareholder hurled two eggs at Gleeson and Sheehy as the bank sought investor approval for the State s EUR 3.5 billion recapitalisation. Bank of Ireland governor Richard Burrows became the fifth bank chairman to step down, saying that accountability must be taken at the top after the bank upped its estimate for long-term loan losses to EUR 6 billion and due to the plummeting stock. ILP s Gillian Bowler, the only surviving chairwoman across the six domestic financial institutions, refused to stand down, proclaiming herself to be a fighter not a quitter. She outlined to shareholders that the company intended to restructure itself so it could offload its loss-making bank, Permanent TSB, in an anticipated consolidation of the banking sector. Dr Michael Somers, head of the National Treasury Management Agency, under whose roof Nama will operate, caused quite a stir in mid-May when told the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) that he knew very little about how the agency would operate and that the Government was facing an appalling dilemma . He warned that Nama could be a bonanza for lawyers. The publication of Anglo Irish Bank s half-year results at the end of the month showed the scale of the problem. The bank posted EUR 4.1 billion in losses, the largest in Irish corporate history, wiping out the bank s capital reserves. The Government agreed to a EUR 4 billion State bailout, while the bank hinted at further future losses and more demands for State capital. JUNE New recruits were brought in to steer the Irish banks. Former Bank of Ireland chief executive Pat Molloy joined the bank as governor. Gerry McGinn, formerly head of Goodbody Stockbrokers in Northern Ireland, replaced Fingleton as chief executive of Irish Nationwide and Irish Life s chief executive Kevin Murphy stepped up to take the helm at ILP. JULY & AUGUST By the start of July, Bank of Ireland warned that operating profits (before heavy loan losses) were under pressure due to higher funding costs. Permanent TSB tried to offset this by increasing the standard variable rate on 50,000 mortgages. The ensuing uproar scared other lenders off repeating the trick. The heavy losses from the collapsing property sector began to hit home as developer Liam Carroll became the first mega borrower to seek protection for his heavily indebted companies. After a marathon legal battle and two failed bids for protection in the High Court and Supreme Court, the group collapsed under debts of EUR 1.3 billion in October. The case showed the scale of the writedowns facing the banks and posed a huge dilemma for Nama. Late in July, the Government published the draft Nama legislation but omitted the key detail of how much the State would pay on the loans. The Bill said the Government would buy some loans at a long-term economic value above the market value as the properties backing the loans had no buyers in the current distressed market. SEPTEMBER More than five months after announcing Nama, the Government finally disclosed on September 16th that it would buy property and associated loans of EUR 77 billion from the banks at a cost of EUR 54 billion, representing an average discount or haircut of 30 per cent across the five participating lenders. This represented an overpayment of EUR 7 billion to account for the long-term economic value as the market value of the properties backing the loans was EUR 47 billion. The plan was to withhold EUR 2.7 billion of the EUR 54 billion from the banks so as to share the risk between the banks and the State. The Government said that Nama would buy EUR 28 billion in loans from Anglo, EUR 24 billion from AIB, EUR 16 billion from Bank of Ireland, EUR 8 billion from INBS and EUR 1 billion from EBS. For INBS, it would mean the loss of 80 per cent of its loans, putting its future as an independent institution in jeopardy. AIB said it would now raise EUR 2 billion in extra capital over the next 12 to 18 months, while Bank of Ireland said the discount on its Nama loans would be significantly less than the 30 per cent average. September marked the arrival of a new chief executive at Anglo,Australian banker Mike Aynsley, to repair the broken bank. The Government appointed academic and banking expert Dr Patrick Honohan as governor of the Central Bank to replace John Hurley. The appointment broke a long tradition of installing a senior civil servant to head up the bank. OCTOBER The Government appointed Bermuda banking regulator, Matthew Elderfield, to the head of financial supervision, a new role within a reformed Central Bank Commission, which would remerge the old Central Bank and Financial Regulator under the same roof. The Government issued a draft business plan saying the National Asset Management Agency would turn a profit of EUR 5.5 billion by 2020 with a 10 per cent rise in property values after previously saying it would break even. NOVEMBER Bank of Ireland and AIB submitted five-year restructuring plans to the European Commission under the terms of the State s EUR 7 billion recapitalisation. Both saw their share prices slump after a brief rally to the middle of September as the property valuations on loans heading into Nama weighed heavily on the banks. At the end of the month, Bank of Ireland revised upwards an earlier estimate, saying the Nama haircut on its loans should not be greater than the 30 per cent average. The bank said that it would not need further State capital, to the surprise of many in the market. AIB was rocked by yet more controversy during the month when it decided to appoint insider Colm Doherty, head of AIB s capital markets division, as managing director a new title created as a compromise when the bank could not find a suitable external candidate, the Government s preferred option. Mr Lenihan was furious when the bank subsequently proposed maintaining Mr Doherty on his current annual salary of EUR 633,000, above the Government s EUR 500,000 pay cap. The bank quickly backed down. Anglo said that it would create a good-bank/bad-bank post-Nama as this was the cheapest option facing the State, far cheaper than liquidating the bank, a route favoured by many members of the public. The Government s repair work on the banking sector moved on to the two smallest lenders, EBS and INBS, during November. With the lenders preparing to sell a combined EUR 9 billion in loans to Nama, Lenihan encouraged both institutions to engage in merger discussions given that both would require substantial sums of State capital to fix them. DECEMBER The clean out of second-tier senior executives at Anglo began this month with the Minister for Finance pledging that any former or current managers at the bank who were in default on outstanding loans would be pursued. By Christmas, Anglo chief Mike Aynsley had filled nine of 10 positions on his new management team with five insiders and four outsiders. The bank also began its court action against Mr Drumm to recoup loans of EUR 8.3 million. ILP shareholders voted for a restructuring that would facilitate a quick disposal of Permanent TSB. AIB s shareholders agreed to participate in Nama. Irish Nationwide and EBS secured approval from their members to take up to EUR 2.4 billion in capital from the Government in return for issuing controlling stakes to the Government. This paves the way for the Government taking a stake of up to 90 per cent in the enlarged EBS-INBS mutual, but the jury was still out at year end as to whether Permanent TSB would be added to create a third force in domestic banking to rival AIB and Bank of Ireland. Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan called for a 9-11 style inquiry into the causes of the banking crisis, which brought a cool response from Government. By the end of the year, the Government s running total on bank capital injections stood at EUR 11 billion with up to EUR 2.4 billion more sought by the building societies. Merrion Stockbrokers estimated that AIB and Bank of Ireland would require an additional EUR 7.2 billion, though some of this may come from private investors and asset sales. Anglo will need several billion more to cover further losses and to fund its restructuring, if approved by the EU. In the week before Christmas, the Government finally unveiled the board of Nama, which will be chaired by former Revenue chairman Frank Daly and feature among others retiring IMF executive Steven Seelig, who, in correspondence ahead of the Nama legislation, memorably commended the wording of the definition of long-term economic value on bank loans as masterful in being sufficiently specific and sufficiently vague to allow appropriate flexibility . The Irish banking system is set for radical change through 2010 and the State will fund the reshaping, a bill that could amount to EUR 20 billion and possibly more. This is before the EUR 54 billion Nama plan and the long-term sweating of bad assets that are currently worth EUR 47 billion at most.",1,debt,2008 crisis,,,,usa
102,The Irish Times,10/09/1997,Another Tribunal,"The debate on the McCracken Tribunal report which opens in the Dail today will be of immense importance in establishing the future quality of democracy in this State. The public will look to its elected representatives to respond with urgency to the damning findings of the tribunal of inquiry into Dunnes Stores payments to politicians. It will require the introduction of more effective safeguards against political corruption and greater transparency in regard to business/political relationships. In particular, it will demand further investigation of the murky lifestyles enjoyed by Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry during a time in which they held high government office. 97091000103 Mr Haughey's behaviour in response to the McCracken Tribunal's investigation has already resulted in papers being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions to see whether he should be prosecuted. And much of the former Taoiseach's evidence to the tribunal was found to be ""unacceptable"". Mr Lowry left himself ""vulnerable to all kinds of pressure from Dunnes Stores"" and availed of off-shore bank accounts in order to avoid tax. It was ""an appalling situation"", the tribunal found, that a minister and chairman of a parliamentary party could be seen to be ""consistently benefiting from the black economy"". There was also the question of Mr Lowry misleading the Dail. As well as considering these matters and the Coalition Government's legislative response to the report, the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, will announce the terms of reference for a new tribunal, designed to further explore the sources of Mr Haughey's wealth and to establish whether any payment made to him influenced government decisions or conferred any benefit on the donor. A similar approach will be taken to Mr Lowry's finances. The draft terms of reference for the new tribunal envisage an investigation into funds received by Mr Haughey, or by any other Minister, through the Ansbacher deposits. But they do not require identification of the beneficial owners of the huge sums of money - up to (pounds) 38m at one point - held in these offshore accounts. Given the uncertain legality of the deposits, the new tribunal should at least be required to liaise with the Central Bank on whether exchange controls were breached by the owners and the Revenue Commissioners should be consulted on the tax evasion implications. That would go some way towards reassuring the public that the law is being applied at all levels in society. The decision by the Government, on the prompting of the opposition parties, to include the operations and effectiveness of the Revenue Commissioners within the terms of reference, is to be applauded. The other matter to come before the Dail is an allegation against the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Burke, that he received large sums of money from building interests when he was a government minister in 1989. Mr Burke has confirmed that (pounds) 30,000 was received. And he has insisted that nothing improper was involved and that no political favours were either asked for or granted. He will provide further details concerning those matters today and will be questioned closely by the opposition parties. In the present fraught circumstances, where politicians are scarcely held in high public esteem, it is important that Mr Burke should get a just and fair hearing from his colleagues. But, if questions remains unanswered, it is vital that the new tribunal be asked to investigate these issues in a thorough and impartial manner.",0,,,,,,
103,The Irish Times,28/12/2016,ANOTHER YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY; International turmoil was the last thing Ireland's new government and 'new politics' needed,"Politics in Ireland changed abruptly in 2016. The changes were domestic - a new Government operating in novel circumstances - and foreign, where the European Union, the UK and the US - Ireland's three most important political and economic relationships - also experienced a rupture with the past.  A hundred years on from Ireland's own rupture with the past, the political outlook has not seemed so uncertain for years. The challenge always when looking back over a year's events is to separate the significant from the merely newsworthy. What are the events that historians will remember in 20 years time? What will they have forgotten by the time the turkey is digested? What actually mattered, and what was just ephemeral? The year began counting down to the general election; in fact, much of the second half of 2015 had been devoted to the same, mostly fruitless, activity. By the beginning of this year, however, Dáil term limits meant that the election campaign had to start within a matter of weeks. Parties began the year scrambling to complete their final preparations, as the clock ticked down. Because it controls the calling of the election, the advantage is always with the incumbent government in these circumstances. But the Fine Gael-Labour coalition, riven by behind-the-scenes divisions on election timing, strategy and co-ordination, contrived to fritter away that advantage. The long-planned first day of the campaign went badly awry, with a messy announcement in the Dáil (the Taoiseach neglecting to name the actual date for polling day), an awkward farewell scene between Enda Kenny and Joan Burton at Government Buildings, and a bungled first Fine Gael press conference at which the Taoiseach faltered badly on questions about economic policy. As it had begun, so it continued. The Fine Gael campaign misfired badly, while Labour's worst fears were realised. Labour's trauma was severe - and ongoing, judging by the extent to which Brendan Howlin and Joan Burton continue to talk defensively about the last government. Life support  The confidence in Fine Gael that voters would return to the fold, re-electing the Government on the back of its economic achievements, proved remarkably resilient - enduring right up until the results definitively disproved it. Fianna Fáil, Independents of all stripes, and Sinn Féin all made gains.  If 2016 was, as the editors of a recent book declared it, the ""election that nobody won"", then it was certainly clear who had lost it. Fine Gael lost a third of its seats; Labour was flayed alive, dropping to just seven seats. After the election the party was on life support - and still is, really. Spoils and responsibilities  It was months before a government was put together. Kenny tried everything, including an offer to Fianna Fáil to share equally the spoils and responsibilities of administration, potentially up to and including the office of Taoiseach.  Micheál Martin wouldn't bite. But he did offer to facilitate Fine Gael leadership of a minority government, if Kenny could make the numbers. The deal was a ""confidence and supply"" agreement, meaning that Fianna Fáil would support the Government on votes of confidence and (money) supply, in return for guarantees on specific policy areas, and the odd appointment. The deal was for three years. At the time, few reckoned it would last. Kenny still needed the Independents, and they knew it. Despite much mutual suspicion, the desire of politicians to wield power aligned with their instincts to do a deal. Some viewed it as their best chance of achieving things for their constituents; others were outsiders who longed to see what it was like on the inside.  They all saw the chance that the parliamentary arithmetic afforded them now, and perhaps never would again. Shane Ross, Finian McGrath, John Halligan, Seán Canney, Kevin ""Boxer"" Moran, Denis Naughten and Katherine Zappone took the plunge, and joined the Government. Some of them looked as if they could hardly believe it themselves. Some of them still have that look on occasion. The novel arrangement was hailed as ""new politics"", and its supporters declared it a decisive break with the past, a new way of doing things where the Government would be subject to an empowered parliament, leading to better policies and more transparent politics. In reality, it soon became apparent that backroom deals were just as much a feature of the new politics as they had been of the old. The Dáil and the Government did operate in a different way, but that wasn't because the culture of politics had changed; it was because the Government didn't have a majority in the House. That was, and remains, the biggest fact about Kenny's second administration. Matters were slow to settle down, and the mutual incomprehension between some of the Independents and Fine Gael occasionally tripped over into loathing, especially in the case of the new Minister for Transport. Shane Ross was a sufficiently diligent student of past administrations to know the perils that accompanied the status of the smaller group in government. Ross's solution was to constantly, and often abrasively, assert the Independents' identity against Fine Gael in Government. Government breakdowns  That led to near breakdowns - on abortion, on the Apple judgment , on the appointment of judges of all things - between the two parts of the Government. By the end of the summer, the odds of the Coalition lasting looked flaky enough. But what didn't destroy them made them stronger, and by the end of the year, the Government seems to have found a way of cohabiting and communicating with itself. It doesn't mean that rows and breakdowns don't happen - they do - it just means that they have found a way of getting over them. Often, though, the way of getting over problems is to postpone a decision on them.  The Government was only a few weeks in office when the biggest story of the year for Ireland broke in London. Former UK prime minister David Cameron's spectacularly reckless gamble had failed: Britain had voted to leave the European Union. Kenny was already up when his staff rang him early on the morning of June 24th to tell him the news. Within hours, Cameron appeared on the steps of 10 Downing St announcing his intention to resign. In Dublin, politicians rubbed their eyes in disbelief as officials dug out their Brexit contingency dossiers, thanking their lucky stars that they had gone to the bother of compiling them in the first place. It rapidly became clear that the Government had done more thinking about the consequences of a Leave vote than its British counterparts had. Ireland's interests were quickly identified and articulated as maintaining the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, keeping the Border between North and South as invisible as possible and protecting the EUR 1 billion a week in trade between the two countries. Cleverly, Ireland placed these concerns in the context of the transformed relations between the Republic, the North and the British as a result of the peace process.  The sympathy of Brussels might be wispy about the threat to the Irish economy, but the peace process - of which the EU had been a strong financial supporter - was a different matter.  These objectives were wholeheartedly supported by the British Government. But what wasn't clear - and still isn't, really - is where they sit on the British order of priorities. The Common Travel Area is important; but is it more important to London than exercising control over the UK's borders? The open Border between North and South is important; but is it more important than leaving the single market? The relationship between Ireland and the UK is special; but is it special enough to require special treatment in the UK-EU deal? Theresa May took the reins in Westminster and recast her government with a strong Brexiteer element. There have been intense contacts at official and diplomatic level. But really, we are no closer to knowing the answers to these questions. That is a cause of severe, behind-closed-doors frustration in Dublin. They are not alone. Most of Europe is expressing their impatience with the British in more explicit terms. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon, on meeting May and being warned not to undermine the UK negotiating strategy, complained that in the absence of any information about what the strategy actually was ""there's nothing there that I can see to undermine."" It was a fair enough summary. Liberal consensus  The consensus of the liberal centrists, the dominant creed of western governments since the fall of the Berlin Wall, was under pressure everywhere in 2016. The resentment among working-class voters at the effects of globalisation is rooted in culture as much as economics but the age of austerity has turbo-charged it - it was the engine behind Brexit, behind the defeat of the constitutional reforms in Italy and the resignation of its prime minister, behind the rise of the Front National in France, ahead of that country's fateful presidential election next year. But its most remarkable manifestation was in the previously unimaginable victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election.  Trump's election will change the world. Indeed, he has already changed it, by altering the way people see the US, and its previous guarantees of free trade and security. All in all, Ireland has been an obvious winner from globalisation and free trade, nimbly pitching itself between America and Europe. If Trump's America turns its back on the world, Ireland will feel a chill. Kenny, though, was in like Flynn, securing a conversation with the new president-elect before many major world leaders, including the UK's prime minister, to the obvious displeasure of the Union Jack-underpants section of British press. At home, there were howls of outrage at Kenny's eagerness to high five the Donald, though polls indicated the public backed Kenny's realpolitik. Being as friendly as possible with whoever is in the Oval Office remains a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy. If Trump pursues even half the policies he floated during the campaign, that long-standing position may well be tested. International affairs have played a huge part in our politics over the last six months, but it is domestic issues that cause the Government most concern. Housing has been a recurring social and therefore political problem since before the Government took office, and while Minister for Housing Simon Coveney has launched impressive action plans to tackle the shortage and the consequent problem of soaring rents, it is not yet clear whether the measures will achieve their intended outcomes. Abortion became an issue during the year, with the Government accepting for the first time that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which underpins Ireland's strict anti-abortion laws, may be repealed. There is widespread public support for repeal, but much less clarity on what might replace it. The question is currently being considered by the Citizens' Assembly, which will report midway through next year. The economy has remained robust, even if the warning signs are beginning to turn to amber. The Government's problem is that the healthy exchequer finances have led to a flurry of demands to spend them. At the head of the queue were gardaí, who threatened an unprecedented - and potentially illegal - strike, a threat which gardaí were clearly prepared to carry out. A late late Labour Court recommendation - of the sort nobody could remember a precedent for - averted the strike, but incensed other public service unions who had maintained the discipline of the Lansdowne Road agreement only to find that others prospered by ignoring it. Public sector pay is now poised to be one of the main political issues of the new year. It was a livelier year in the Dáil, as the Government found itself regularly defeated on the floor of the House. The power of individual TDs was greatly enhanced, both politically and rhetorically. There is no doubt that the Dáil is more important in our national political debate, but there is little sign that its inhabitants are sure what to do with their new-found power. Perhaps it says something about the nature of this Government that many of the chief political issues to emerge during the year - abortion, water charges and public sector pay - have all been kicked to touch. A kick into touch is only that, however; sooner or later, someone throws the ball back in.",1,political,elections,,,,ireland
104,The Irish Times,21/12/2019,Another year of uncertainty on Brexit undoubtedly lies ahead,"The remarkable thing about 2019 has been the resilience of the economy to the threats it faces - notably Brexit. Right up to November, and well past the delivery of Paschal Donohoe's budget for 2020, there were real fears of a no-deal Brexit at the end of January. Yet while this is reflected in confidence indicators - and has had some impact in areas like house prices and investment - all the signs are that the economy has kept on trucking. Probably the best indicator is the growth in the number of people at work - which up to the third quarter was rising by about 1,000 a week.  Some of this is not surprising - after all growth is being driven in part by multinational investment which is not particularly exposed to the Brexit threat. But the impact of uncertainty on the behaviour of households was less than might have been anticipated. In particular, encouraged in many cases by rising incomes, consumer spending is rising by well over 3 per cent a year. The one area where the Brexit impact was more noticeable was investment. The overall investment figure for the economy is rising strongly, but this is largely due to higher construction spending - and some multinational accounting factors. Investment outside construction by Irish businesses has fallen off a bit - though may now rebound with the January 2020 risk removed.  National economic data is affected by multinational accounting now more than ever. A measure developed by Goodbody stockbrokers to estimate the underlying growth in the domestic economy shows it is rising by more than 3 per cent per annum. This is well below headline GDP growth of 6 per cent but still well ahead of most other countries.  Of course the strategy of carrying on and ignoring Brexit has turned out to be precisely the correct one for those who did it. The cliff-edge threat for January 2020 is now off the table. And while a new cliff edge may well appear at the end of December next year - the deadline for a new trade deal to be done - expert opinion is divided on how this will all play out. Some see UK prime minister Boris Johnson making concessions to the European Union to get a basic trade deal in goods over the line by the end of 2020, inevitably edging towards a softer, less damaging Brexit. Others see the United Kingdom now setting off on a course of divergence from the EU, allowing for a less favourable initial deal with the EU and more significant economic damage. Or even threatening that new December 2020 cliff edge. Wave of pressure  We will have to watch the pointers moving into 2020. Johnson will face a huge wave of pressure from UK businesses to do a decent deal with the EU. But Brexit is a political project rather than an economic one. It would still seem unwise to presume that it will all now somehow be okay and that we will head towards a less damaging Brexit. At very least, another year of uncertainty on this key economic issue for Ireland lies ahead. The danger has been pushed out, but it has not gone.  The other issue which will come to a boil next year is international tax reform, where a process led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has reached a crunch stage. This will take some hit on our corporate tax revenues - though this is now growing so rapidly that judging how serious this will be is very difficult. But the more fundamental issue is the proposed setting of a minimum corporate tax rate and the risk this poses to Ireland's use of our low tax rate to attract companies to invest here.  A lot will come down to whether agreement is reached on this part of the reform programme and what the detail of it is. But as broadcaster George Hamilton would say when a striker from another country approaches the Irish goal: ""Danger here."" If Brexit is the threat to our domestic economy, this is the key issue for multinationals. And it is one where Ireland is now sharply on the defensive and operating without the ""veto"" we have at EU level. At the OECD we can say ""no"", but everyone else will shrug their shoulders and press on regardless.  Corporate debt  These two big factors will dominate a lot of discussion in the early part of next year. But the lesson of 2019 is that growth now has a momentum which can carry on regardless. Of course if some of the risks turn into reality, we have seen how growth here can turn very quickly - how the Irish economy can operate like a bit of a roller-coaster. At least now, unlike 2008, we don't have a huge exposure in household or corporate debt if some of the shocks do hit over the next few years.  Trying to move off that roller-coaster - or at least make the ups and downs less sharp - is a key issue for policy. And now sustainability is entering the equation in a big way too, threatening at least some of our traditional economic philosophy of chasing growth and investment almost at all cost.   Next year could feel a lot like the one just ending. An economy ticking along in the background when debate is dominated by Brexit and its political and economic consequences. And, of course, a general election. It will be a strange campaign, with the Government playing up the positives on the overall economy and the Opposition focusing on the problems in areas like health and housing.  Fine Gael would do well to remember that ""Keep the recovery going"" was a slogan that didn't work too well last time. And all sides should take note that there are threats out there which haven't gone away and that there is only so much any Irish government can do when faced with international risks.

105,The Irish Times,17/07/2020,Apple tax decision gives Martin space to reboot as Taoiseach,"It was fortunate for Micheál Martin that on the morning after the sacking of Barry Cowen the General Court of the European Union made a decision in the Apple tax case which was critical for this country's international reputation and indeed for the future prosperity of its people. The repercussions of the Apple case and the Government's decision to postpone lifting some of the Covid restrictions swept the Cowen sacking and its fallout from the headlines. The Taoiseach now has a chance to put his uncertain first few weeks in office behind him and move on to the issues that really matter. The ominous thing for Martin is that the early days of Fianna Fáil's return to office were beginning to look like the final days of its last stint in power. The shambolic last phase of Brian Cowen's government in January and February 2011 is something that threatened to destroy for good Fianna Fáil's reputation as a serious party of power. Martin has presided over the steady recovery of the party's reputation since then though a combination of patience and firm leadership. While the failure to become the biggest party in the general election was a serious disappointment the fact that Fianna Fáil made it back to power through the unprecedented coalition with Fine Gael offered hope of a new phase in the party's history. The return to political chaos immediately after taking office is something the Taoiseach brought on his own head. First there was the inexplicable decision not to appoint his deputy leader Dara Calleary to the Cabinet, then the outbreak of wailing and gnashing of teeth by a variety of TDs disappointed at not getting ministerial office, followed by the embarrassing Cowen episode. If Martin doesn't manage to draw a line under it and get his party focused on the challenges of governing in a time of a pandemic, his time in office will be short-lived. The Apple case has provided a breather and he needs to take advantage of it.  Silver lining The silver lining of the Cowen episode is that the three-party coalition remained solid in the face of the pressure. Neither Fine Gael nor the Greens made any effort to capitalise on what was an internal Fianna Fáil matter and that is a hopeful sign for the prospects of a cohesive government in the coming years. That is why the decision by the EU court in the Apple case was so important. The comprehensive nature of the decision in Ireland's favour should help to ensure that the country remains an attractive location for foreign direct investment , regardless of the inevitable changes that are likely to take place in the international corporate tax regime. This country's reputation as a democracy committed to the rule of law was threatened by the claim promoted by EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager that Ireland had provided Apple with a sweetheart tax deal that breached EU state aid rules. If upheld it would have done enormous damage and fuelled the unfounded claim that the country is nothing more than a tax haven. The focus on the allegation that EUR 13 billion was owed to the Irish exchequer has obscured the fact that last year alone corporation tax contributed EUR 11 billion to the exchequer. The rising contribution from the multinational sector is helping to offset the reduction in other taxes due to the Covid crisis and points up again how much the Irish economy depends on international trade.  Some kind of parasites Attacks on the multinational sector from a range of sources have obscured the vital contribution it makes to the country's prosperity. Sinn Féin and the hard left TDs are not alone in promoting the narrative that the multinationals are some kind of parasites  using Ireland only to evade tax and avoid their responsibilities in other countries.  The two centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, need to be more robust in defending and explaining the central role foreign investment plays in creating prosperity for society as a whole. The massive improvement in living standards over the past half century happened only because Ireland got over the misguided notion it could survive in self-sufficient isolation and opted to join the international trading order. That process was initiated by two vital decisions taken by Fine Gael and Labour when they were in government in the late 1940s and 1950s. The first was the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority and the second was the introduction of export tax relief which later morphed into the 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate. Fianna Fáil under Seán Lemass in the 1960s followed up on those initiatives which ultimately led to membership of the EEC.  The inimitable Conor Cruise O'Brien once outlined why he and other Labour TDs favoured EEC membership in 1972 in spite of his party's official opposition to it. ""There were quite a few people who, in their hearts, were frightened at the idea of being locked up alone in the cold, clammy dark with Cathleen Ni Houlihan and her memories of the dead."" Unless our mainstream parties start explaining the facts of economic life to the electorate in a coherent fashion that is precisely where we will return in the years ahead. ",0,,,,,,
106,The Irish Times,10/09/2016,"Apple's taxes, budget priorities, AIB 'fixed', media moves and . . .","nFor so long the good boys in the class, the Government remained firmly on the European Union's naughty step this week as the fallout from the European Commission's ruling on Apple continued unabated.  Following the State's move to appeal last week's record finding by the commission that the Republic granted Apple EUR 13 billion in illegal state aid, there were a number of encounters between Government Ministers and EU officials.  Commission vice-president Andrus Ansip met Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Minister of State for European Affairs Dara Murphy.   Speaking to The Irish Times ahead of his visit, Ansip dismissed the soundings that had  been coming out of Government circles since the decision, and said the case taken against the Republic was ""based on facts"". ""I think we all would like to have fair competition in the European Union, ensure that all players, all companies have to be treated equally - the same applies to Apple,"" he said. ""If one restaurant, for example, has to pay all the taxes according to law, and a restaurant next door does not, what kind of fair competition is that?"" Kenny also had to contend with European Council president Donald Tusk, and said the pair ""had a conversation"" about the judgment even though it was outside the confines of the meeting's agenda. ""I had a conversation with president Tusk at the beginning of our meeting here today and I explained to him the reasons and the background to the situation insofar as the European Commission making its decision about Apple is concerned,"" said Kenny. The Taoiseach is likely to find himself at loggerheads again with Europe down the road with new plans for further ""cross-border harmonisation"" of tax rules across the EU being discussed.  With Dublin sure to oppose such moves, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan is likely to have received a frosty reception when he arrived in the Slovak capitalBratislava on Thursday ahead of his first face-to-face meeting with EU finance ministers since the judgment. Minister for Jobs Mary Mitchell O'Connor took some time out from snipping ribbons to say she had been contacted by a number of US multinationals expressing concern about the ruling. Stopping short of the red carpet and harpist on this occasion, she nonetheless moved to soothe the worries of the job creators and said the Republic's sacred corporate tax rate would not be compromised. ""We profoundly reject the European Commission's findings, and the Government has together decided that we will appeal the findings,"" she said. ""We totally reject that there was State aid or that there was a special deal done for Apple."" Interestingly, close Kenny ally and Irish European Commissioner Phil Hogan felt Brussels was far enough away from Dublin for him to reject Government claims that the judgment was an attack on the Republic's corporate tax practices.  Hogan, appointed by Kenny to the plum post in 2014, shed the green jersey and said the decision had ""nothing to do with taxation, nothing to do with corporate tax rates"". ""It has to do with state-aid rules, and the interpretation of the European Commission is that the tax structures that were established by one particular company has implications for state-aid rules,"" he added. Rating agency Fitch was on hand to provide a more measured analysis of the lay of the land. It said the ruling would have mixed implications for the Republic and played down the risks to inward investment. ""It could result in a substantial one-off improvement to Ireland's fiscal position,"" it said. ""But [it] may also add to medium-term economic uncertainty and increase political risks . . . If used to pay down debt and/or reduce borrowing rather than spent, this would accelerate the improvement in public debt dynamics that has been driven by fiscal consolidation and robust nominal growth."" The Government begrudgingly acknowledged that the State would have to accept the EUR 13 billion award in the Apple tax case if the appeal failed. The Department of Finance said the Revenue Commissioners is now obliged to collect the EUR 13 billion and it will be put into an escrow account. If the appeal is successful, the money will be returned to Apple. However, if the commission's decision is upheld, it conceded: ""The sum will be paid to the Irish State."" It's a cruel world.  nOf course, the timing of all this couldn't be much worse for the Government with a budget next month. Every lobbyist in the State is sharpening knives as they prepare to fight for the biggest pieces of the pie.  Fair enough, the Republic this week raised EUR 1 billion in 10-year borrowings at a record low rate of 0.33 per cent, taking advantage of the extraordinarily low interest rates at play in international markets.  But Central Bank governor Philip Lane has stressed the need for prudence in the budget, warning the Government not to base spending plans around temporary spikes in tax revenue.  The State's fiscal watchdog also chimed in, warning that the Government's planned budgetary adjustment this year would end up being substantially larger than the EUR 1 billion previously flagged.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council claimed that when added to new spending commitments in health and education, the total package of measures earmarked for Budget 2017 would, in fact, amount to a EUR 2.4 billion adjustment. nIt has been a turbulent few years for AIB but the State-owned bank's chief executive, Bernard Byrne, this week proclaimed: ""We have fixed the bank.""  In a speech delivered to the Leinster Society of Chartered Accountants, Mr Byrne said it was now ready for a long-awaited stock market initial public offering (IPO) whenever the Government decides to pull the trigger.  ""We have fixed the bank, we've done the work, we've remediated the issues and we've made it more efficient,"" he said. ""Our challenge now is to move to the next phase. It's about being quite different into the future as we face into a different competitor set.""  Another company preparing itself for the stock market is packaging company Ardagh, which told bondholders about plans to raise up to EUR 270 million through floating part of the business on the New York Stock Exchange in a move that would value the group at EUR 4.5 billion.   Sources close to bondholders said the group planned to float 5 per cent of the shares in its operating company on the market in the first half of 2017. nDenis O'Brien-controlled media giant INM continued to extend its reach this week with the acquisition of the publishing division of Celtic Media Group, which comprises six weekly regional newspapers, a biweekly newspaper and a pre-press service.  Its regional titles include the Anglo Celt, the Connaught Telegraph, the Meath Chronicle, the Offaly Independent, the Westmeath Examiner and biweekly newspaper and website Your Forum. The move increases the company's regional titles from 13 to 20. Business Week Colin Gleeson ",1,taxes,apple case,,,,ireland
107,The Irish Times,17/03/2017,Are Irish mortgage holders facing a hike in interest rates next year?; A significant minority in the markets now expect the ECB to start pushing up interest rates next year,"There is one lesson for Irish borrowers - and savers - from this week's increase in US interest rates. It is how quickly expectations in the market can change. Little more than a month ago, the market was not expected to rise this week. By the time the increase came on Wednesday, comments from US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues in the interim had prepared the markets and the 0.25 point increase came as no surprise. But it shows how a few sets of positive economic figures and some nudging from those in charge can change expectations - dramatically - in a matter of weeks. The Fed cut rates sooner than the European Central Bank (ECB) and has started to increase them well ahead of Europe. For the moment, interest rate markets in Europe are signalling that the ECB will not start to increase interest rates until the second half of 2019. But the euro zone economy is picking up, inflation in on the rise and a significant minority in the markets now expect the ECB to start pushing up interest rates next year.  A few months of positive economic data could quickly turn this positive view into a market consensus. But it is simply too early to call this one, with the outlook now on a knife edge, depending not only on economic performance but also political factors, notably the Brexit negotiations and the French presidential election. Forecasts are so uncertain because we are emerging from one of the most extraordinary periods in economic history, requiring extraordinary actions from central banks. Fed interest rates stayed at effectively zero for a full seven years, only starting to edge up at the end of 2015.  The ECB was slower to react, but in Europe the key rate has been below 1 per cent since 2012 and are also now fallen to zero. The Fed and the ECB, along with the Bank of England, have also pumped vast wads of money into their economies via the purchase of Government and other bonds - so-called quantitative easing .  This is a traditional method used to push cash out into the market, even if the scale of its use in recent years is completely unprecedented. Fear of deflation  The fear they were fighting was deflation, a dreaded combination of low growth and low inflation which can feed on itself and condemn an economy to years of inertia. This is why the pick-up in the rate of inflation on both sides of the Atlantic is so crucially important, along with rising employment and stronger growth.  But the economic collapse was unprecedented and the recovery has been slow and stuttering, leading to huge uncertainty on interest rate trends. The Fed increased its key rate by 0.25 points in December 2015 but it was December 2016 before a second increase was announced. This week's rise was just the third in a decade.  What has now changed is that - for the first time - markets are confidently expecting a succession of further Fed hikes this year and into 2018. The era of super low rates is ever-so-slowly coming to an end. Normal service may soon resume, even if the unpredictable ""Trump factor"" could still upset US forecasts. It is not only in the US that economic conditions are improving. Euro zone growth is also recovering and headline inflation is now just below the ECB's 2 per cent target, even if on-off factors including higher oil prices mean underlying inflation is lower. Fears about China have eased. The initial expected economic hit from Brexit has not materialised, even if huge uncertainties about its impact remain.  Slowly, forecasts are being revised upward in Europe. Senior German central bankers and research institutes, already feeling that the ECB is doing too much to boost the euro zone economy, are starting to mutter even more loudly that ECB policy should be starting to return to normal. And ""normal"", sooner or later, means higher interest rates. ""The world economy has certainly been improving of late and if that improvement is sustained, then policy settings will need to adjust accordingly over time,"" according to Simon Barry, chief economist at Ulster Bank in Dublin. ""Simply put, the more progress that is made in getting economic conditions back to normal, the stronger the case for getting interest rates - and other policy settings - back towards normal levels."" Rate debate  A few months ago, few expected ECB rates to rise before 2019. Now, as the economic signals pick up, the debate is on. When will the ECB start to phase out its quantitative easing programme? And will it start to increase rates only after this is over - as it had indicated - or before?  Danske chief analyst Jens Peter Sorensen acknowledges that talk of earlier interest rate hikes is gaining momentum, even if Danske are still not buying into it. ""The rise in inflation is temporary and driven by the higher oil price and food prices - so in our view we have seen the peak in inflation for now,"" says Sorensen. ""We think it is a bit premature to talk about rate hikes - but the market is always 'right' - so this theme about hiking rates earlier than expected is gaining a lot of momentum."" In Dublin, the majority view among analysts remains that it will be 2019 before the ECB moves its key refinancing rate - the one which will kick on automatically to a rise in tracker mortgages. However, there are also dissenters. ""We expect the ECB refinancing rate to remain at zero until the third quarter of 2019,"" says Philip O'Sullivan, economist at Investec in Dublin. ""We expect the ECB to announce a tapering of its quantitative easing programme by the end of this year. Our view on the timing of an ECB refinancing rate hike chimes with the futures market, which doesn't see one happening until the second half of 2019."" Dermot O'Leary, economist at Goodbody, says it is now clear that there will be no further easing in ECB rates and the next move will be an increase. ""However, I believe a rate hike is some time away, likely in 2019,"" he adds. For all that, there are supporters of the idea of an earlier move by the ECB and much debate about the sequence of change as it winds down its programme of quantitative easing and starts to move up its various interest rates. European banks are particularly exercised about the negative return they get on short-term deposits, and it is possible that this could be phased out before any rise in the main refinancing interest rate.  Alan McQuaid, economist at Merrion Capital believes that the ECB will move sooner, rather than later. ""I think they will start hiking rates in the first half of 2018,"" he says. Uncertain outlook  It is an uncertain outlook for mortgage holders. Approximately 360,000 mortgages in Ireland are on tracker rates and will vary automatically as the ECB moves. Another 300,000 or so are on standard variable rates. These are also likely to edge higher as the ECB moves, though given that they are already higher than the euro zone average, banks will be under pressure to not pass on at least some of any ECB rise. Much will depend on the state of competition in the Irish market when the increase comes.  Savers, meanwhile, may finally start to see deposit rates move from their current historic lows, where average rates on demand deposits are less than 0.1 per cent after Dirt tax. Here, too, competition will play a big part.  A key issue is that, while rates will rise, most expect that the peak will be a lot less than in previous cycles. ""The peak in rates will be a lot lower than previous cycles at 2-2.5 per cent ,"" says McQuaid, ""but that will still be a significant hit for many Irish mortgage holders."" O'Leary of Goodbody also warns that, in the years ahead, mortgage holders need to prepare for a return to normality. ""Rate hikes are likely to be gradual, but we should certainly be thinking about a 'normal' level of rates being in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range,"" he says.  Either way, the peaks in rates on both sides of the Atlantic is likely to be below the 4 per cent plus seen in the previous two economic uplifts. The Fed governors expect US rates to be around 3 per cent by 2019. And Europe is well behind. If the camp that believes ECB rate increases will not start until 2019 are correct, mortgage holders have time to adjust. By the end of that year Investec expects that ECB rates will still be at just 0.5 per cent. The outlook for Irish borrowers is now on a knife edge. The view that rates will start to increase in 2018 could quickly be bolstered by signs of an euro zone economic uplift. Or victory for Marine Le Pen in France could throw everyone's calculations out, leading to a period of uncertainty. Economists are used to dealing with economic uncertainty - but the extra frisson of political upheaval means firm predictions are impossible. But the debate is on and, for the first time, talk of interest rates moving higher is back on the agenda.",1,monetary,interst rates,,,,usa
108,The Irish Times,01/05/1998,Arguments against EMU have been oversoldThose against monetary union have an exaggerated faith in the effectiveness of counter-cyclical monetary policy in our small open economy,"The EMU debate has livened up over the past few months. Several economists have argued strongly against Ireland joining EMU, in this paper and elsewhere. Yet, to date, the anti-EMU view has had no perceptible effect on any actual decision. This doesn't mean that the anti-EMU alarm bells have been redundant. By drawing attention to the problems of adjusting to EMU, they have alerted public opinion to the need for serious preparation to cope with the challenges of a single currency. But the question still remains: why have they had so little impact on policy? Initially, the main thrust of the anti-EMU case was that, with Britain not participating, Irish firms would be vulnerable to sterling volatility, especially sterling weakness. Any sustained decline in sterling beyond 105p pounds has caused real problems in the past. While the present exchange rate of 83p indicates that sterling has a long way to fall before it would cause difficulties, we should not be complacent. 98050100179 But, post-EMU, the problem of sterling volatility will be easier to cope with for two reasons. First, what really hurt Irish business during past bouts of sterling weakness was not just competitive pressure from Britain, but that it was combined with sky-high interest rates. In the EMU, if sterling weakens, we will no longer have to contend with emergency interest rates to placate speculators betting on a pound devaluation. Second, after EMU, devaluation will not be an option. There will be no pound to devalue. There will, as a result, be intense pressure on Irish firms, employees and Government to adopt more flexible pricing and wage bargaining strategies than in the past. Recently, EMU critics have shifted emphasis from the sterling factor to the loss of an independent monetary policy. This change in emphasis is driven by concern over Irish inflation. After EMU, interest rates will be determined by the needs of the European, not the Irish, economy. While all members of EMU will be in the same quandary in this respect, Irish economic conditions have tended to be particularly divergent from the EU average because of the Irish economy's closer links with the British and US economies. Hence we are likely, the arguments goes, to have low euro rates when the Irish economy needs high interest rates, and vice versa. The anti-EMU case assumes that the past pattern of economic fluctuations will continue into the future. But this view is open to challenge. First, cyclical fluctuations in the Irish economy did not just happen. To a considerable extent they were induced by pro-cyclical fiscal policy. That is, historically, Irish governments have tended to inject too much money into the economy during booms and too little during recessions. Under EMU fiscal guidelines the scope for such policy mistakes will be much reduced and fiscal policy will be much less destabilising. Second, account should be taken of Ireland's rapidly changing economic relations with the outside world. As economic relations with the Continent deepen, fluctuations in the Irish economy are likely to become more synchronised with continental EU countries. Hence, the problem of different cyclical patterns between Ireland and Europe and of ""wrong"" euro interest rates for the Irish economy may be less acute than opponents of EMU suggest. Even if Ireland's cycles and our EMU partners remained divergent, to stay out of EMU may not be the best option. The anti-EMU's vision of a highoctane Irish Central Bank, fine tuning the economy from year to year and providing soft landings or quick recoveries a la carte, is highly implausible. It reflects an exaggerated faith in the effectiveness of counter-cyclical monetary policy in a small open economy like Ireland's. Such a policy would require flexible exchange rates an often unstated assumption of those advocating it. Thus, if our Central Bank increased interest rates to slow down the economy, this would result in a stronger pound. How much stronger we don't know. That would be for the foreign exchange market to decide. A few years down the road we might need lower interest rates, with a weaker pound. To be sure, the Federal Reserve Bank in the US operates such a system quite successfully. But Dame Street is not Washington DC. Interest rate adjustments which generate large, uncontrollable swings in our exchange rate could impose disproportionately heavy costs on Irish business. Some EMU critics recommend that the Central Bank should focus on an effective exchange-rate target for the pound, thus steering a middle course between fluctuations in sterling and the euro. However, the closer the Central Bank adheres to a fixed exchange rate target, the more circumscribed its power to implement counter-cyclical policies. Staying out of EMU could involve serious economic loss to the Irish economy. The benefits of price transparency, reduced transactions costs, diminished uncertainty, cheaper access to the EU capital market, would be foregone. An opt-out decision could also impact unfavourably on foreign investment. Investors are reassured by Ireland's commitment to EMU and our closeness to the decision centre of European economic policy. Suppose, even more seriously, that EMU abstention were to weaken the Government's commitment to fiscal control? We know that the Maastricht criteria provided the discipline, focus and all-party support for fiscal balance that has played a crucial role in Ireland's growth. To argue against participating in EMU on the grounds that our economy has been doing well with the present 15 per cent EMS band misses the point. An important part of the reason why things have been going well is that we have been committed to EMU. Some argue that EMU fiscal constraints will undermine the Government's capacity to respond to a severe economic downturn. But, far from damaging the economy, the EMU target of a zero budget deficit in the medium-term will ensure fiscal balance and a better managed economy. Provided we generate fiscal surpluses during the boom, an effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy could be operated without breaching the 3 per cent budget deficit limit. The arguments of those advocating postponement (or cancellation) of EMU entry have been oversold. They exaggerate the dangers of being in EMU and underplay the dangers of staying out. Moreover, with time, the down-to-earth practical gains from having a common currency with continental Europe could prove more important than now appears.

109,The Irish Times,11/09/2019,"As Brexit looms, do we really need a budget next month?","The skies above Government Buildings may be mercifully short of kites this autumn, but there appears to be no curtailing of the annual circus around October's budget despite the Brexit juggernaut picking up speed on the other side of the Irish Sea. Tax breaks for entrepreneurs, Help to Buy and income tax cuts are all up for discussion as we await Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe's pronouncements on October 8th.  But, with a populace possibly more concerned about whether or not they'll still be drinking Lyons Tea in six weeks' time, or if they are one of the 80,000 whose jobs could be at risk, or even delighting at the prospect of the return of duty free shopping, it does beg the question. Do we really need to have a budget in October?  An Irish budget is a peculiar thing. Yes, in the UK, the chancellor of the exchequer will show off his little red budget briefcase and garner column inches, but it's hard to find another country that greets the publication of the Government's household budget with as much pomp and circumstance.  In France, the government's financial plans are dished up with far less hoopla and much more deliberation, with budgetary decisions discussed for up to a year in advance before incremental changes are typically made to avoid a ""yellow vest""-type revolt. In Germany, the setting out of the budget - which started with finance minister Olaf Scholz 's speech yesterday - is very much a ""circular process"", as the Bundestag describes it. Budgetary plans are discussed in parliament over the course of a week. There's no magician, no rabbit, and no hat. Here in Ireland, however, budget day gives the incumbent Government an unrivalled PR opportunity to set out its stall, show just how ""grown up"" and fiscally prudent it can be, while offering the electorate a little something - even if it often just matches inflation - by unveiling extensive detail on all its planned tax and public spending changes on the one day. Arguments  No surprise then, that some argue budget day is an unnecessary and unwarranted farce or spectacle.  Yet, without a fully blown budget day, would people be aware of just how much of a State pension they might be entitled to? Or how little benefit a much-discussed childcare supplement will actually offer a typical family? There may be plenty of arguments to keep up the tradition, but the jury may be out this October at least.  With the potential for so much economic uncertainty on the back of a disorderly departure from the EU by the UK, is this really the time to learn the pint is going to go up by 10 cent or the benefit in kind exemption on electric cars will be extended, or the threshold for inheritance tax increased by EUR 10,000? Of course, the room for manoeuvre for any finance minister is circumscribed. Our budget must come within the constraints of an EU framework. Not so long ago, the budget was held in early December, with a much shorter time frame between the government revealing any giveaways and the public feeling the benefit in their January wages. If the budget was benign, it set the scene for a bumper Christmas shopping period. But then the financial crash intervened, and the Government brought forward the date back in 2008 to deal more urgently with deteriorating economic circumstances. It never moved back.  And following the so-called ""two pack"" agreement of 2013, which aimed to improve budgetary surveillance in the euro zone, new rules now apply anyway. We are constrained by EU budgetary requirements, and, like all other euro zone states, must submit our draft budgetary plans for the forthcoming year to the European Commission and the Eurogroup of finance ministers between October 1st and 15th. In practical terms, this means the government has to make its decisions on major budgetary components - such as taxes, capital spending, and social payments - by that date. Where it has more discretion, however, is on forecasts for individual tax headings - such as corporation tax, capital acquisitions tax and income tax. Clearly, the forecast yield of any tax change is required but not the specifics. So why not leave them out until we have more certainty? The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council warns today that a hard Brexit could see a large budget deficit emerge, due to falling taxes and rising unemployment-related costs. The knock-on effect, it says, is that the Government would be forced to cut spending or raise taxes to prevent debt ratios from rising. So a slight delay in presenting a budget might give the Government that bit more flexibility in setting out its strategy. It's true that Brexit uncertainty - even if the UK does leave on October 31st - will continue for some time but we might at least know in November whether the exit has been hard or soft.  This is not just a factor for us here in Ireland. In the UK the budget is typically set for a day in October or November, but while the UK government's spending review was published earlier this month the treasury has yet to confirm a date for the British budget.  And even after the budget day drama, there is always scope for a supplementary budget or wriggle room to wait for December's Finance Bill to flesh out the finer details of the Government's fiscal plans. Yes, a budget in some form must come together between now and October 15th. But whether it needs the detail of a typical annual budget day is another question.",0,,,,,,
110,Irish Independent,13/04/2016,"As FF and FG dither, economic uncertainty and risk increases","FINE Gael and Fianna Fáil dither, six weeks after the election, about the formation of a new Government, while potentially one of the biggest economic risks facing the country is just around the corner. Having been barely mentioned in the election campaign, you'd hardly know it was of importance to us at all. The warning issued yesterday by the IMF about the potential consequences of a British withdrawal from the European Union is the starkest yet from the Washington-based lender. The Fund's chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, says there could be ""severe regional and global damage"" if Britain votes to pull out of the EU. An exit would present ""major challenges"" and a prolonged period of uncertainty, which it says could dent confidence and have a negative effect on investment. The warnings have been plentiful. And Ireland is front and centre in terms of the fallout should the vote be to pull out. Experts believe Ireland could be among the countries in Europe worst-hit should an exit occur, given the close economic, political and societal links between the two countries. The ESRI has predicted trade could slump by up to a fifth; business lobby group IBEC believes the value of sterling will be forced sharply down, which would be a huge negative for Irish firms selling into the UK market. Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland Secretary and one of the key 'leave' advocates, has argued that there is no reason to believe that the common travel area between the two countries would end simply because of an EU withdrawal, insisting that it predates EU membership. But one of her predecessors, Peter Mandelson, who's backing the remain campaign, believes otherwise. Last month he said border controls could be imposed. With the campaign ramping up ahead of the June 23 vote, expect claims and counterclaims. Nobody knows for certain what might happen. And it could be argued that even if Ireland had a stable and functioning government, it could do little about the outcome of a referendum in another sovereign territory, or the uncertainty that it is creating. But without a government in place, we're heaping uncertainty on top of even more uncertainty.",1,monetary,brexit,,,,uk
111,Irish Independent,13/10/2008,At the last-chance saloon nobody's buying a round,"GOVERNMENTS have been drinking at the Last Chance Saloon when it comes to rescuing the world financial system, but it seems there is still a great reluctance to pay for the rounds.  Last night's announcement from the emergency meeting of EU leaders fell short of the all-out strategy now being advocated by most economists.  This would see governments putting fresh money (capital) into the banks so that they can begin counting and admitting all the capital they have lost through making loans which have not been repaid and, worse, buying loans and derivatives of loans at prices far above their real value.  How far above was horribly illustrated on Friday at an auction of bonds issued by failed investment bank Lehman Bros. They were sold at less than 10 cents on the dollar, which means those banks which bought the bonds have lost over 90pc of their money.  There is a general consensus now that losses in the global banking system are over a trillion dollars ($1,000 billion). It is an unimaginable sum but, to get a better handle on it, losses in the Irish banking system are estimated at between EUR10bn and EUR20bn. No-one knows for sure. No-one knows for sure anywhere, which is the root cause of the virtual closure of the banking system.  As those losses are taken on board, banks will shrink in size, their profits will drop and many will go bust, but how much and how many' This is why banks are holding on to the cash they have, and are unwilling to lend to others. Until that changes, the world faces the catastrophe of a failed financial system which would shrink not only banks but economies as well.  Different governments have tried different solutions, and none has worked. One reason why not, it is felt, is that the solutions are all different. Ireland's blanket guarantee of deposits and bank borrowings for six lenders was particularly unpopular, because it led to runs on the deposits of other banks which were not covered.  One of the main purposes of yesterday's meeting was to get EU governments to all act in the same way. It appears to have succeeded in this task, withan approved ""toolbox"" of measures governments can take. The box does not contain the deposit guarantees offered by Ireland, but Taoiseach Brian Cowen seemed optimistic that the scheme will get approval from the Commission in the next few days. Watch for the small print, though.  However, the key part of the agreement was that which said governments will take stakes in troubled banks, to ensure the smooth functioning of the eurozone economy. (It was essentially a eurozone meeting, but Britain was included because of its size. There is also the curious fact that the toolbox bears an uncanny resemblance to measures announced by the British government last week).  The agreement falls short of the co-ordinated, immediate re-capitalisation of banks which many analysts had called for. But it is widely expected that Germany, France and others will begin the process quickly. Mr Cowen said it would be ""unhelpful"" to speculate about what he will do, which will strike many in financial markets as very unhelpful. Uncertainty is the problem.  With a EUR15bn deficit yawning before Brian Lenihan tomorrow, one can see why the Irish Government does not want to think about finding another EUR14bn (to take a figure used by NCB Stockbrokers) to re-capitalise the banks. It is not quite the same as the Budget deficit, though. Because the money would be used to buy an asset -- bank shares -- it would not count under EU rules. There would be dividends and perhaps fees from the banks in return. And in the end, if it worked, the taxpayer might make a tidy profit. But the interest repayments on such as sum would be around EUR700m a year, and that is serious money.  The Government's hope still seems to be that it can merge one or two of the small, weaker lenders among the six, and that the bigger banks will take them over, under the protection of the guarantees. Not surprisingly, they are not too keen on the idea. And one reason for last night's agreement is that rescues like this have a habit of coming unstuck. It failed with Hypo in Germany and there are still doubts about the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS -- parent of both Ulster Bank and Halifax Ireland.  Last night the Norwegian government added to the pressure on governments to re-capitalise banks by committing the huge sum of $55bn. It intends to buy troubled mortgage debt with the money.  In a way, it is all quite simple. Until banks admit their losses, and start writing them off, we will not begin to get back to normal. They cannot do it without new capital. But banks don't want to write off such huge sums, and neither the markets nor governments particularly want to invest in banks in this state. But waiting for some softer option to arrive is no longer an option. ",1,debt,2008 crisis,,,,usa
112,The Irish Times,13/05/1994,"Attack breathes life into idea of third banking forceThe idea of a third banking force has been given new political life following the speech by the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, yesterday,","JUST AS commentators were laying the idea of a third banking force to rest as another piece of unworkable Labour Party ideology, Mr Reynolds has breathed new life into it by drawing public attention to the blood sucking proclivities of the Irish banking system. Mr Reynolds has been a long term critic of banking practices in this State and, while Minister for Finance, he threatened on more than one occasion to do something about the funereal practice of banks which requires that the deeds of family homes be put up as collateral for small business loans. The reluctance of banks to lend money, particularly to small and medium sized enterprises; the level of their charges; their demands for collateral and the extent of their profits have all given rise to admonitions from Mr Reynolds at various times. But the banks are such unpopular institutions with the public that, over the years, they have also drawn the fire of the Fine Gael leader, Mr John Bruton, and of the Tanaiste and Labour Party leader, Mr Spring. 94051300099 It is politically popular to criticise the banks, especially as they are seen to operate a near cartel in terms of presiding over an almost uniform system of borrowing and interest rates, while the Central Bank has no function in regulating their profits. In that context, politicians fired sporadic shots across their bows in the past and did nothing more about it. Self regulation was the name of the game. But that was before the Programme for Partnership Government undertook to establish a third, State controlled banking force, using the TSB bank, along with the ICC bank and ACC bank, as the nucleus of the new entity. Suddenly, there was a real threat to the cosy arrangements which existed between the associated banks. With the emergence of the National Australia Bank as a potential and officially favoured purchaser for TSB bank, that threat appeared to recede. But now, in the aftermath of Mr Reynolds's statement, the threat may have developed a different configuration. Labour Party Ministers took new heart from the Taoiseach's strictures. Party sources said total State control of the third banking force would not be necessary, as the Programme for Government made provision for a link with an international bank. The emerging picture seemed not dissimilar to that painted by officials from National Australia Bank at a meeting with the Minister for Finance, Mr Ahern, last weekend, where they spoke of a State stake in a new group involving the National Irish Bank, the TSB bank and ICC bank. But final decisions on the structures of any new State favoured bank are months away. Mr Reynolds as his spokesman made absolutely clear had said nothing specific about a third force. All he did was to draw attention to an apparent change in lending policy by the banks which maximised their profits at the expense of job creation. Over the past 15 years, the Taoiseach said, the gap between the interest paid on large demand deposits and the interest paid on loans by small businessmen and farmers had ""widened from a mere 2.75 per cent in 1979 up to 10.75 per cent today"". Given the low inflation rate of 2 per cent, real interest rates were too high, Mr Reynolds said, and the ""continuous squeezing of the productive sector the economy is particularly serious"". The Taoiseach posed the question of whether larger bank profits were being made at the expense of jobs. He sought an explanation as to whether their reluctance to cut interest rates reflected an unwillingness to squeeze ""the over generous profit margins that they have awarded themselves"". The banks rejected the criticisms out of hand but then, in the death less comment of Mandy Rice Davies: ""They would say that, wouldn't they?"" The timing of Mr Reynolds's criticisms is also significant, coinciding as it does with the unveiling of historically high annual profits by both the Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland. A large proportion of those profits has been generated domestically and, in recent days, there have been complaints from local authorities that the banks refused to compete for their business, while imposing large fees and interest charges for their services. More central to Mr Reynolds's thinking may be a recent report from the Dublin firm of Bloxham Stockbrokers which warned that the predictions for growth by the ESRI may not be realised because of a failure by the banks to provide long term finance for small and medium sized industries. On the basis of their past performance, the report said, the main banking groups may prove to be a major logjam in economic development because they may not be prepared to blend sufficient funds. If economic growth is jeopardised because of the timidity and greed of the existing banking system, it becomes a major argument in favour of a third force, for a failure to realise the economy's growth potential would not only condemn the 284 400 people at present unemployed to an uncertain future, it would eventually destroy the parent Coalition arrangement. Both Fianna Fail and the Labour Party have been generating a ""feel good"" factor for the electorate in recent months, based on projections for growth. If the expectations of the electorate are dashed, Mr Reynolds knows that he will be first in the firing line. See also Business This Week",0,,,,,,
113,Irish Independent,22/04/2013,Austerity battle hots up among Coalition partners; Labour tries to assert itself but FG tells Burton to stick to plan ; Austerity battle hots up between Coalition parties,"TENSIONS in Cabinet over the impact of austerity have emerged strongly after ""off-message"" remarks by a senior Labour figure at the weekend. Fine Gael ministers insisted the Government must stick to plans for cuts and taxes after Labour deputy leader Joan Burton signalled people have been pushed to their limits by austerity. The warning from the Social Protection Minster comes as President Michael D Higgins echoed criticisms of austerity from within the junior coalition partner. Labour sources pointed out that Ms Burton and others were only making similar points to those made by the President in his speech to the European Parliament last week, and again over the weekend. But their comments come in the wake of the Meath East by-election meltdown - when Labour came fifth. Rank-and-file Labour TDs have demanded that their ministers assert themselves and the party''s policies more in Government. However, senior Fine Gael figures say more tough medicine is required to get the country back on track and boost investor confidence. Ms Burton - who said she believed ""we have reached the limits of austerity"" - has been warned that any attempts to ease up on austerity will put Ireland''s greater economic recovery at risk. Meanwhile, the Irish Independent has learned detailed preparations for next year''s Budget - which takes place this October rather than December - have been stalled until the (EURO)300m in public sector pay savings envisaged by the Croke Park deal are achieved. It is understood the Economic Management Council (EMC) - comprising Continued on Page 12 INSIDE MICHAEL D HIGGINS 'We need to challenge status quo' Taoiseach Enda Kenny, Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore, Finance Minister Michael Noonan and Public Spending Minister Brendan Howlin - have agreed not to begin detailed discussions on next year's Budget until it is clear this year's targets will be met. And one Fine Gael source told the Irish Independent that the only way recovery will come about is if budgetary targets of cuts and taxes are adhered to - not by easing up on austerity. ""It's worrying how quickly some people forget that we're still in a bailout programme borrowing a billion a month from the troika because nobody else has been willing to lend to us at affordable rates,"" said the senior Government. source. ""The only feasible way for Ireland to finance more investment in job creation is to implement the planned savings in public sector pay and social welfare . ""Those EU countries that can afford to borrow more to support growth should do so. Unfortunately, Ireland is not one of them - we still have the biggest budget deficit of any eurozone country, including Greece."" Ms Burton has already raised the possibility of reducing the amount of cuts and taxes in this year's Budget, using the (EURO)1bn saved as a result of the promissory note deal. Many in Fine Gael are opposed to this, and Labour sources said Ms Burton had already made similar points in the wake of the deal. Sources close to Ms Burton also said there is no rift with Mr Gilmore, and those close to Mr Gilmore said many in Labour had been making similar points recently. But, in an interview, Ms Burton said a move out of the Department of Foreign Affairs by Mr Gilmore would be ""widely welcomed in the Labour Party"". Communications Minister Pat Rabbitte said, ""we are at a tipping point"" with austerity but said the Coalition must press on with its plans in order to exit the bailout at the end of the year. Labour sources also said President Michael D Higgins made similar points in his speech to the European Parliament last week, when he criticised austerity and the approach of EU leaders to the economic crisis. But Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said ""austerity is working"", pointing out that the deficit is down and there is growth in the economy. He said one more tough budget is needed for Ireland to exit the bailout programme and regain economic sovereignty. The uncertainty created by the rejection of the Croke Park II agreement has stalled preparations of next year's Budget - with detailed discussions on hold until the (EURO)300m in public sector pay savings envisaged by the Croke Park deal are achieved. ""We've agreed to discuss next year's Budget - when we're confident this year's Budget is being fully implemented and we're meeting our deficit and growth targets,"" a source said, adding the ""logical sequence"" Meansthis cannot be done until the Croke Park savings are found.",0,,,,,,
114,The Irish Times,09/02/2013,Austerity in coming years less harsh due to debt deal,"A book-length treatment would be required to provide a full analysis of the complex transactions which occurred this week and that resulted in the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC), expansion of Nama, and effective replacement of promissory notes lodged at the Central Bank with long-maturity sovereign bonds. An important outcome is that the Irish fiscal position has substantially improved thanks to lower debt servicing costs, a reduction in the scale of market funding required and the pushing out of the maturity dates on these bonds to the far-distant future. Part of the fiscal gain stems from the commitment from the Central Bank to hold a substantial proportion of the freshly-issued sovereign bonds for a sustained period (unless the financial environment sufficiently improves to enable it to sell the bonds on an accelerated schedule). Since the Government is the shareholder in the Central Bank, the net income from these bond holdings (the difference between the interest rate on the bonds and the cheaper rate that the Central Bank pays on its euro system liabilities) is returned to the Minister for Finance. This should not be viewed as outside the remit of the Central Bank, since it is the byproduct of the original intervention to provide emergency liquidity (against collateral) to Anglo and Irish Nationwide. Occasionally, troubled banks cannot be saved and must be closed. If a bank is liquidated and cannot repay its debt, the Central Bank acquires the associated collateral. This happened here this week with the liquidation of the IBRC; in 2008, the ECB seized collateral when the German affiliate of Lehmans and the Icelandic banks failed. While the net income from ECB-level liquidity operations (and the proceeds of the collateral seized in the event of bank failure) are shared across the system, the net income from the exceptional liquidity assistance (ELA) extended by national central banks (with the approval of the ECB) accrues to the local shareholders. In the IBRC case, the main collateral was the promissory note. Under the deal, this has been exchanged for a set of sovereign bonds with the same face value. Although the associated payment schedule to the Central Bank is prolonged relative to the promissory notes, the market tradability of the bonds is a valuable attribute, so that the instrument exchange is a win-win with gains to the Central Bank and the Government. Sovereign debt crisis An additional gain is that the deal enhances the stability of the Irish financial system and the Irish fiscal position by eliminating the dependence on ELA, which was subject to review by the ECB on a fortnightly basis. The counterfactual scenario by which the Government simply declared that the promissory notes would not be honoured would likely have triggered a full-blown sovereign debt crisis. After all, the scheduled payments under the promissory notes were owed to the Central Bank of Ireland under the ELA facility. The rules of this facility are that losses have to be made good by the national government, so that non-payment of the promissory notes would simply have increased the effective level of Irish sovereign debt by the same amount. Given this sequence, any attempt by the Government to unilaterally reduce the face value of the debt would have been interpreted as a type of sovereign default. Furthermore, it is implausible that the reputational impact of an attempt at a selective non-payment on the liabilities owed to the euro system could have been contained, in terms of relations between Ireland and other European governments and the risk-averse element of the investor base for sovereign debt. The ability of the pillar Irish banks to use Irish sovereign debt (or Irish government guarantees) to avail of cheap euro system funding would also have been severely impaired under this alternative scenario, since the credibility of the ECB in preserving payment discipline across the euro system would require it to tighten eligibility criteria and collateral rules in relation to Irish sovereign instruments. For these reasons, any decision to renege on the promissory notes could only have been in the context of a wider decision to seek sovereign debt restructuring, which would be a radical break from the current economic strategy. (The wider debate on sovereign debt sustainability will doubtless continue to run.) What are the implications for Ireland s fiscal strategy? The analytical framework that underpins the fiscal treaty would indicate that the target primary (non-interest) structural surplus Ireland needs to achieve in the medium term is lower. In turn, this more attainable target means that the scale of required austerity in the coming years is appreciably less than was required before this week s deal. However, there remains a considerable fiscal gap to be closed before this target is achieved. Accordingly, while it may be politically tempting to slow down the pace of fiscal adjustment in order to deliver a short-term dividend from the deal in terms of easier budgets in 2014 and 2015, this would be a risky strategy for several reasons. First, the international growth pessimism debate speculates that the next few years will reveal that the medium-term output growth trend (at home and overseas) may be lower than projected, which implies a tougher fiscal future. Second, even if not envisaged under central scenarios, the playing out of our household debt crisis may ultimately require extra capital injections into the Irish pillar banks, which would negatively alter Ireland s fiscal profile. Substantial adjustment Third, there are multiple scenarios by which the international sovereign debt crisis reignites, leading to higher funding costs. All told, these downside fiscal risks would be easier to handle if the fiscal deficit is closed more quickly. Furthermore, given that substantial adjustment is still required, delaying the spending cuts and increases in revenue prolongs fiscal uncertainty. This adjustment overhang delays private-sector recovery, since households and businesses cannot make firm plans if the individual elements in the required fiscal adjustment remain unspecified. It also runs the risk of fiscal fatigue on the part of politicians and the electorate, since implementing spending cuts and revenue hikes is progressively more difficult as the date of the next general election draws closer. This Government faces many severe economic challenges (fiscal adjustment, public sector reform, household debt restructuring), while the full recognition of the special nature of Ireland s bank-related debts requires further major steps at the European level. At the same time, this remarkable (if limited) deal should not be under valued. It is a major achievement for the Government and the policy officials who designed and delivered it.

115,Irish Independent,08/10/2008,Australian rate cut may have domino effect in UK and EU,"THE European Central Bank was under added pressure to cut interest rates yesterday after the Australian central bank unexpectedly cut its key interest rate by a full percentage point.  The Australian move heightened speculation of a co-ordinated easing of monetary policy in the next few days by major central banks. Bank of England bosses are expected to cut rates by 0.50 percentage points tomorrow.  There are fears that ongoing financial turmoil could wreck the world's banking system and worsen a global slump, with a co-ordinated series of rate cuts seen as a way to head this off.  Yesterday, the Economic and Social Research Institute said it expected European interest rates to fall by one percentage point to 3.25pc next year.  However, the ESRI's Dr Alan Barrett does not expect Irish retail banks to pass on all of the fall in rates to borrowers.  Goodbody economist Deirdre Ryan said it was clear that stock markets globally were gripped by uncertainty despite policy moves made by central banks and governments around the world.  Move  She added that the move by the Australian Central Bank to cut rates illustrated ""the truly global nature of the crisis and we certainly would not rule out interest rate cuts closer to home in the very near term"".  ""While these may not be co-ordinated in nature, the extent of the crises indicates that the response will be similar across all economies.""  Ms Ryan said the Bank of England, which is due to meet today, is likely to cut rates in Britain by 0.50 percentage points.  ""In the eurozone, President Trichet's significantly softer rhetoric last week has put easing firmly on the policy agenda there also,"" she said.  ""With the US Federal Reserve not averse to taking aggressive action when needed, we may see it move before its scheduled meeting at the end of this month.  ""With economies weakening across the globe, not least in Ireland, it is a case of the sooner the better.""  Economist  Michael Saunder, senior European economist at Citigroup, commented: ""There seems a growing chance of emergency ECB and Bank of England easing in the next few days.  ""To be sure, early easing, even by 0.50 percentage points or more, would not provide a full solution to the current economic and financial crisis.""  So far, some central banks have been reluctant to move as fast as the US Federal Reserve in lowering borrowing costs.  The ECB in July increased its benchmark rate to 4.25pc and the Bank of England has left its key rate at 5pc since April.  The Fed, by contrast, has slashed its benchmark rate by 3.25 percentage points to 2pc. ",1,monetary,interst rates,,,,australia
116,The Irish Times,18/10/2019,Avoiding no-deal takes one big risk off table; The Irish economy could get a 'relief bounce' from deal but hybrid nature of plan opens up opportunities for fraud and smuggling,"For the Irish economy, the Brexit deal done between the EU and UK presents two tantalising possibilities - one short term, while the other concerns the longer term shape of the UK exit.  The most immediate, of course, is that if this deal does finally get approval - now or later, perhaps even after a UK election - a no-deal Brexit and all its costs and uncertainties for Ireland are avoided.  Then, if this happens, both sides say they want to negotiate a long-term trade deal including zero tariffs which - if it came about - would remove a risk to Irish exporters to the UK, notably the food sector.  Of course, as ever with Brexit, there are two big ""ifs"". The most obvious is the short-term uncertainty and the risk that the deal will not be approved, with as now uncertain consequences.  If it is approved, then the outcome of future trade talks will in itself be uncertain - there is no way of knowing if the aspiration of tariff-free trade will hold.  Transition period Were this deal to get acceptance, the UK leaves the EU and goes into what is called the transition period,  a kind of standstill where current trading arrangements remain. This removal of a no-deal risk would be a huge boost to the short-term prospects of the Irish economy.  Official forecasts are that in the event of a no-deal, the economy would grow by only 0.7 per cent next year and a recession would be a possibility. If this is avoided, economic growth next year could be over 3 per cent. In the short-term, the Irish economy could get a ""relief bounce"" if a no-deal Brexit is finally taken off the table. Consumer and business confidence have been affected by the prospect and it has had a wider impact on spending, investment and even house prices. It would also boost exchequer finances, as Budget 2020 was constructed on the basis of a no-deal Brexit, with all its implications for growth and tax revenue. If a no-deal Brexit is avoided, then the forecasts for the exchequer next year will swing from a deficit to a surplus. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said that, while the forecasts may be adjusted, he will not present another mini-budget package to give away any of the proceeds of faster growth.  The budget presented earlier this month was intended to deal with either outcome.  However a swing into surplus next year will give all the parties scope to make promises as we enter a general election campaign - whenever that comes. Of course this all depends on how the political drama plays out, with no guarantee of House of Commons support for a deal and lingering uncertainty and risk.  If a deal is done, then as things stand the transition period is due to end on December 31st, 2020. Given that the EU and UK will hardly be able to do a new trade deal in such a short period of time, this could well lead to more uncertainty moving through next year on what happens next.  There is provision in the withdrawal agreement to extend the transition by up to two years, though UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said he does not want this to happen.  To understand the new deal, we need to forget the old idea of the backstop - the guarantee that there would be no hard border in any circumstances. This is because what has now been negotiated is not a backstop, it is the way things are likely to be in future, albeit that a future EU/UK trade deal could change some aspects of it.  It is a mechanism to allow a hybrid kind of customs regime in the North, which is likely to apply unless there is a political change in the UK which reverses the decision that as part of Brexit it will leave the EU customs union.  The concession by the Irish Government was to move this from an ""all-weather"" promise to one depending on the consent of the Stormont Assembly.  Given the way this vote would happen, it would mean neither side would hold a veto - it is thus politically saleable in the Republic. But could it leave the North's economy facing some long-term uncertainty, as all is now in the hands of its representatives who could vote every four years?  How this might sit with major foreign investors with long time-horizons is worth considering. The hybrid nature of the plan also opens up new opportunities for fraud and smuggling. A powerful EU/UK joint committee is to try to draw up plans to minimise this risk; this will be significant and complicated work and it will be vital from the Irish point of view that it is seen to function well.  We do not need any questions about the validity of goods leaving this island for continental EU markets.  Business and the Border Businesses  on the southern side of the Border will take note, also, that this new planned arrangement does underpin the UK leaving the EU customs union. This means those trading with the UK will face new customs requirements and bureaucracy once the transition period ends. These will impose significant costs.  A plus is the commitment in the political declaration to seek a ""zero-tariffs"" trade deal in the future. This would remove the risk of heavy tariffs on items such as food hitting Irish exporters in a key market and pushing up prices in the shops. However this is not binding and is all up for negotiation after Brexit happens. It would depend on the UK meeting indications in the political declaration that it will not cut standards after Brexit in areas such as employee rights and the environment - so-called level playing-field provisions.  The EU won't want to give favourable access to a lower-cost/lower-standards competitor, were the UK to go down that road. We should note that the UK commitments on alignment here are weaker than they were under Theresa May's proposed deal in 2017.  All to play for So it is all to play for  and much will depend on the way UK politics swings and whether Johnson really does follow his earlier statements and diverge from EU rules and regulations. This will be a big issue in the UK general election, whenever it is called. UK economic forecasters have run the numbers again in recent days and confirmed that a harder version of Brexit brings significant risks and costs to the UK.  For Ireland, the story is as it has always been. Brexit will always be a negative - economically and politically - but, as with the UK, the softer the Brexit, the less the damage.  If a no-deal is avoided, this takes one big risk off the table. However, we are not quite there yet as we watch the drama playing out. Beyond that, if the UK does leave in an orderly manner, then the future shape of a trade deal between the two sides remains a huge economic issue for Ireland.  With the current transition period due to end in December 2020, this will be an immediate and pressing issue and will present another deadline. A sensible strategy for all sides would be to extend the transition period. But as we have seen since the Brexit vote, the economically sensible option is not always chosen.",1,trade,brexit,,,,uk

119,The Irish Times,11/03/2011,Backdoor legislation is no way to tackle thorny issue of copyright,"NET RESULTS:Rumours persist of an attempt to rush through a law to shut down illegal file-sharers IN THE dying days of the Fianna Fáil government, a curious drama unfolded around the area of copyright and music downloading. Going into the final week of February, reports circulated in several places, including this newspaper, that the government planned to sign into force a statutory instrument that would create the legal basis in Irish law for internet service providers to be compelled to shut down illegal file-sharers. The reason for this was reportedly to fill a gap in legislation that caused a High Court judge to rule last November that UPC, one of the largest internet and communication service providers in the State, was not liable for its customers downloading. The judge drew attention to what he saw as a gap, noting that Ireland seemed to be out of compliance with European law. The day after the reports appeared, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation issued a press release in which the then minister Mary Hanafin stated there was no truth in the rumour circulating in the media that I am about to sign a statutory instrument in the area of copyright. By that point, this statement was no doubt true. But in the previous two days, I had spoken to three sources who had been told it was happening although at that stage it did not involve Hanafin, but then minister of State Conor Lenihan. One source is directly connected to discussion on the issue and the stakeholders. This person had been told in no uncertain terms that not only was a statutory instrument considered, it had already gone to parliamentary drafters and the intention was to sign it into law within days. Perhaps few in government circles were aware until the last minute that there was an unseemly drive to have this legislation prepared for signature. Nonetheless, it would seem bizarre that those directly involved with the issue would be told that draft legislation was already being prepared. The eventual turnaround was good news on two fronts. First, there was the devious process by which this legislation was going to be imposed. Statutory instruments, by their nature, end up having little real Dáil oversight and, potentially, little to no public discussion, as a minister has the prerogative to sign them in, creating laws automatically. Best practice demands that there be full consultation with, at the very least, the key stakeholders. In this case, that would have included not just the music industry, which would like to see such a law brought in, but the internet service provider organisations, business groups, and privacy advocates such as Digital Rights Ireland and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. None of these groups was approached for input in advance of the planned legislation. It is understood legal action would have been likely had the government attempted to act on this issue without respecting the consultation process. Notably, the statement by the minister noted that there had been no consultative process and that, therefore, there would be no intention of bringing in new legislation. We seem to have a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. The government statement is correct such legislation should not be considered without the formal consultation process preceding it. On the other hand, I stand by the impeccable source who said they had been told from on high that the process was under way and that the intention was to bring in legislation without any regard for a consultation process. So, for these procedural reasons, it is absolutely proper that the process did not go ahead. But it is also right that it did not happen on the basis of larger, and as yet unresolved, issues about the fairness of such laws, which shift the role of policemen from where it should be with those in a formal law enforcement role to businesses, some of them small businesses already struggling. Why should internet service providers be charged with policing their customers? And why should the costs of having to do so be passed along to the businesses and individuals who use their services, as they inevitably will be? In recent years there has been an increasing tendency to turn misdemeanour internet activity, such as downloading a song illegally, into criminal acts and address them in the same way as one would deal with serious crime. This is using a cannon to crack a nut. The basic issues have been challenged at European level, specifically with a Belgian court case that is currently before the European Court of Justice. That judgment could make any Irish legislation in the area moot. It is better to wait until this issue is addressed at EU level before bringing in legislation here. Either way, we need to consider seriously the bigger picture: the effect on the knowledge economy. At the same time that the government is trying to encourage internet-based companies to come to this country, it threatens to bring in legislation that would make it a considerably less attractive place to do business on the basis of outdated and outmoded copyright laws. A three-strikes law on file-sharing could have wider implications for many companies that store user data, such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others. Bringing such a law in through a statutory instrument (at any stage) can only alarm companies that are looking for a stable legal environment where the government does not whip laws into place with little consultation.",0,,,,,,
120,Irish Independent,26/11/2010,Bailout fails to ease uncertainty over European growth,"IRELAND's bailout may not be enough to prevent further problems in the eurozone, the Economic and Social Research Institute said in a report to be published today.  ""It is hoped that the authorities' recent intervention in Ireland will prevent further contagion.  ""Nonetheless, there remains considerable uncertainty which, if not resolved, could have a negative impact on the euro area economy,"" the ESRI said in a report carried out with sister organisations across Europe.  The think tanks predict economic growth inside the euro zone will slow next year to just 1.6pc, as austerity drives continue to bite, and then inch upwards to 1.7pc next year.  The eurozone escaped from its deepest recession in post-war history in the third quarter of last year.  Its relatively strong second-quarter growth of 1pc surprised markets but growth slowed to 0.4pc in the third quarter.  The think tanks' predictions for eurozone growth are far lower than the Government's predictions for growth here in Ireland. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said on Wednesday in his four-year austerity plan that he expects growth here to average 2.75pc.  Optimistic  Rating agency Standard & Poor's yesterday dismissed the 2.75pc growth assumptions as too optimistic.  ""The gradual weakening of the recovery seen in recent months is expected to continue into 2011 with a modest acceleration in growth anticipated in 2012 as conditions gradually improve,"" the think tanks add.  Interest rates are also seen rising from the present record low of 1pc. The European Central Bank will hike its main refinancing rate to 1.6pc by the end of 2012, the report forecasts.  Unemployment is expected to remain high over the next two years with the average euro zone unemployment rate projected to stand at 9.7pc in 2012.  Germany has powered Europe's recovery while other nations have failed to emerge from the slump as governments step up austerity measures to rein in budget deficits.  Economic growth across Europe ""remains very unbalanced"", said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. ""Growth outside of France and Germany appears to be stagnating at best.""  While Germany's economy expanded 0.7pc in the third quarter, Spain's economy stalled and Greece shrank. Figures for Ireland's performance in the third quarter have not yet been published.

121,The Irish Times,17/08/2010,Bailout of Anglo Irish Bank 'costly but manageable',"IRELAND S BAILOUT of Anglo Irish Bank, a key factor behind the country s soaring budget deficit, is costly but manageable , the head of th Central Bank said yesterday. Prof Patrick Honohan, who is also part of the European Central Bank s (ECB) governing council, said the total cost of bailouts of all Ireland s banks and financial institutions would be around 20 per cent of GDP. He said last week the net cost of the recapitalisation would reach 15 to 16 per cent of economic output, though the final bill would depend on the price Anglo got on sales of loans to Ireland s bad bank scheme.  It s a terrible shock to the system. It s costly but it s manageable, Prof Honohan said yesterday during a speech to a business conference in Hong Kong. The EU last week approved plans for up to EUR 10 billion of State aid for Anglo, and Prof Honohan said over the weekend that plans to recapitalise the bank were well on track and had little impact on the Government s overall deficit plans. However, this year s deficit would swell.  It s a very high deficit measured this year because we re taking the hit; we re acknowledging the losses in the banking system and those losses which are being paid for by the Government have to be included in the deficit.  Asked about recent calls from some Irish banks to extend the country s bank guarantee scheme, Prof Honohan said he would prefer to see it phased out sooner rather than later.  I m not in a rush to remove the guarantee but I don t want it to be in a period longer than quarters, rather than years, because if they ve done the job properly that won t be necessary, he told Reuters. The scheme was introduced at the beginning of the global financial crisis in September 2008 and the EU has approved an extension of it until the end of 2010, but only for debt of over three months duration: the guarantee period for shorter-term debt finishes at the end of September. Prof Honohan also said he saw very little risk of the global economy falling back into recession.  The US economy [has] some concerns; the European economy a gradual recovery. China and [the East] is the bright point so there s not really anything surprising or different from my view, Prof Honohan told reporters. While there were still lingering uncertainties clouding the horizon, there appeared to be a general recovery cycle overall.  It s a weak recovery in Europe, it s a weak recovery in the United States, but it is a recovery.  He declined to comment on the implications for this on the ECB s interest rate policies in the near future. (Reuters)",0,,,,,,
122,"Analysis: Central Bank warns that high prices and growth in mortgages could hinder the Republic if there is a global recovery, writes Cliff Taylor, Economics Editor",24/06/2003,Bank cautious about speedy recovery in the economy,"The old saying about the role of central banks is that their role is ""to take the punchbowl away just when the party gets good"". The difficulty for the Central Bank of Ireland is that, since the introduction of the euro, the punchbowl moving is done in Frankfurt, with little regard to the merriment of the Irish populace. This creates some conundrums for our Central Bank governor. Presenting its annual report yesterday, governor Mr John Hurley clearly expressed concern about the rise in mortgage lending. 03062400100 The traditional way for a central bank to remove the lending punchbowl is to raise interest rates. However, as a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mr Hurley conceded that lower interest rates were possible in the months ahead, if the recent cuts did not stimulate the euro-zone economy. Mr Hurley's overall message was carefully measured. The economy had been reasonably resilient against a difficult international backdrop, he said, managing, so far, to hold on to most of the benefits of the boom. But he warned that significant risks remained and a return to more rapid growth could not be guaranteed. First is the uncertainty of the international climate. The euro zone was not set to pick up until next year, Mr Hurley said. He said that the ECB would ""wait and see"" the impact of the latest interest rate cut before deciding whether another reduction was necessary. However, he added that ""undoubtedly there is scope to cut interest rates if that is necessary"" - a significant signal at a time when rates are already at historic lows. For the Republic, the Central Bank has cut its gross national product (GNP) growth forecast this year to 1.5 per cent from 1.75 per cent previously. Reflecting the poor international environment and its impact on multinational exports, the Bank has reduced its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast by a full percentage point from 3.75 per cent to 2.75 per cent. (Multinational profit repatriations are included in GDP but excluded from GNP, meaning the growth rates of the two aggregates have been quite different in recent years.) Even if international recovery arrives, the Bank sees risks that could hinder the domestic economy from picking up speed. It reiterated its concern that, with the actual level of prices here being 12 per cent above the euro-zone average, the Republic has a long way to go in regaining cost competitiveness. The inflation rate is falling, the Bank believes, but Mr Hurley said the aim must be to get the rate to 2 per cent and keep it there, as this is the ECB goal. The Bank repeated its call for other measures to improve competitiveness, particularly in the light of the squeeze from the rising euro. These include tight control of Government spending, an insistence on productivity improvements in public spending in return for the benchmarking pay awards and a general drive to increase productivity in the sheltered sectors of the economy and in indigenous industry. The other big worry for the Bank is the housing market. The Bank is ""disappointed that the level of growth in mortgage lending has not come down further"", according to Mr Hurley. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which shares a supervisory board with the Central Bank, is examining a study of the mortgage lending policy of institutions, but Mr Hurley said yesterday that it was too early to comment. The Bank is not predicting a housing ""bust"". However, it is concerned that financial institutions are facing ""temptations to cut corners in pursuit of income"" - in other words, extending inappropriately large loans - and this could leave banks and borrowers vulnerable in the event of a sustained downturn, with serious repercussions for the economy. Recent history is ""replete with examples of financial crises being preceded by rapid loan growth and asset price escalation"", the Bank warned. While the banking system is healthy, the Bank goes as far as saying that a persistence of credit growth and house price inflation pose risks to stability. These are strong words from the Bank, which believes that the property market is moving into balance and, while it does not say as much, may well fear that parts of the market are vulnerable to a downturn, particularly the buy-to-let market where demand is falling. The Bank says the property market will hold and stabilise - but as Mr Hurley put it, ""the property market is the property market"" and volatility could be in prospect if economic conditions were to take a turn for the worse.",1,monetary,interst rates,,,,EU
123,Irish Independent,17/07/2015,"Bank guarantee was 'too generous', says Europe; Fundamental problems overlooked, turning a financial crisis into a sovereign debt crisis","THE bank guarantee introduced in 2008 was ""too generous"" and played a major part in turning a financial crisis into a sovereign debt crisis, the European Commission has claimed. The guarantee was based on a ""misunderstanding"" of the problems in the banks, which were seen at the time as liquidity and confidence issues triggered by the global financial crisis, instead of recognising more fundamental problems, according to a report from the commission looking back on Ireland's bailout programme. The report also said that while the negotiations on the 2010 bailout were completed within a week of a request being made, discussions between the then Fianna Fáil/Green Party government and the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission had been going on for three months. Government ministers at the time denied any negotiations were taking place. The European Commission report said discussions had been taking place to ""clarify the situation and explore possible responses to the crisis"". The 117-page report also said the decision not to burn bondholders in 2010 was the correct one, and while it said the bailout programme was a success overall, it ""missed an opportunity"" to provide more fundamental reform to the so-called protected sectors of the economy and to ""confront vested interests"". The Troika has been repeatedly critical of delays in cutting high legal costs. But the most striking aspect of the report is the Commission's reflection on the decision to issue a blanket guarantee to the banks in September 2008. As a result of the guarantee, the solvency of the Irish sovereign and that of the banking system became intertwined, the report said. ""This eventually turned the banking crisis into a sovereign debt crisis,"" the Commission said. ""A further consequence of the guarantee was that the potential for any substantial burden sharing - by bailing in senior bondholders - was limited for its duration. ""With hindsight the bank guarantee appears too generous, and the fiscal impact could have probably been limited if banks had been subject to stricter requirements."" Blame The report, which in essence lays much of the blame for the 2010 bailout on what it sees as the flawed bank guarantee decision, says that when the 2008 decisions were taken, Irish authorities were constrained by high uncertainty. However, it found that by 2008 the economy here was already highly vulnerable. It was the combination of the sharp decline in tax revenues and the cost of bailing out the banks that triggered the national debt crisis, the report said. Overall, the report said the bailout programme was ""relevant, appropriate and effective"". It said the financing provided under the bailout allowed for a ""smooth and sustained"" return to full market access. The report also notes that public sector pay here is ""considerably higher"" than private sector wages, but claims this is because public sector workers are, on average, more highly skilled than private sector workers. Meanwhile, the latest post-programme surveillance report from the European Commission says the Irish economy is rebounding strongly, but warned that the Government's deficit target next year does not take advantage of that strong growth. The report says that medium-term budgetary planning does not include specific policy measures, which clashes with EU budget rules. It also notes that negotiations to achieve further price reductions on patented medicines have failed to achieve any further benefits for the Exchequer, and notes that a critical test of the success of the water sector reform will be the level of payment compliance. It says that without compliance, the utility's ability to raise revenue to address the serious infrastructural deficits in water supply will come into question. ""Payment compliance will be key for Irish Water's ability to raise revenue,"" it said. Six options the Government had to help lenders Banking giant Merrill Lynch provided a number of options to the Government to help the banks ahead of the decision to issue a blanket bank guarantee in September 2008. Here are those options, with the rationale: 1: IMMEDIATE LIQUIDITY PROVISION Short-term liquidity issues for the banks needed to be immediately addressed, most notably at Anglo Irish Bank. Merrill said the Central Bank should be prepared to provide auxiliary overnight liquidity facilities at a penal interest rate to the banks that request it. 2: STATE PROTECTIVE CUSTODY Essentially, temporary nationalisation of a bank. Merrill said Irish Nationwide and Anglo either together or separately could be taken into state custody, with a state guarantee given to all depositors and senior creditors, as well as junior bondholders. The Government would own and control the bank and its decision making. 3: SECURED LENDING SCHEME This would mean that commercial property could be exchanged for Government bonds or cash. This would offer immediate liquidity and would stabilise the sector. 4: CREATE GOOD BANKS/BAD BANKS Merrill said this would create cleansed banks, but pointed out that it would be the most complex and time-consuming option. 5: CONSOLIDATE THE BANKS Allow Irish Life & Permanent and EBS to join up with another bank. 6: BLANKET GUARANTEE Merrill said this would stem outflows and encourage inflows of deposits. But it warned that the scale of the guarantee could be over (EURO)500bn and would almost certainly negatively impact the state's sovereign credit rating and raise issues as to its credibility. 'A consequence of the guarantee was that the potential for any substantial burden sharing - by bailing in senior bondholders - was limited for its duration' ''",0,,,,,,
124,The Irish Times,01/11/2016,Bank of England governor to stay on until 2019; Chancellor praises Carney's leadership 'through a critical period for the economy',"CHRIS GILES   Mark Carney has said he will extend his period as governor of the Bank of England to June 2019, declining to serve a full eight-year term and instead standing down once Britain leaves the European Union. In a letter to chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond, Mr Carney said he was ""honoured"" to serve longer than he had originally intended and, by extending his term until Britain has left the EU, hoped his decision would ""help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK's new relationship with Europe"". In response, Mr Hammond praised the governor's ""highly effective leadership"" of the Bank of England and willingness to serve longer ""through a critical period for the British economy"". The decision will keep Mr Carney as the most important British economic policy official, seeking to maintain economic and financial stability as the nation leaves the EU. Earlier on yesterday, prime minister Theresa May had backed Mr Carney to stay on until 2021, with her spokeswoman saying she would ""certainly be supportive"" if he decided to serve his full eight-year term. Bad side effects  The announcement from Mr Carney follows a period of sustained attacks by Brexiter critics who have been calling for him to resign ahead of time.  Some of those attacks were triggered by Mrs May's speech to the Conservative Party conference when she criticised the ""bad side effects"" of the Bank of England's ultra-low interest rate policy. But yesterday the prime minister's spokeswoman said: ""It is clearly a decision for him, but the PM would certainly be supportive of him going on beyond his five years.  ""The PM has always had a good working relationship with the governor of the Bank of England and intends to continue that."" Pressed on whether Mrs May saw the governor as ""the right man for the job"", the spokeswoman replied: ""Absolutely"". Later the governor met Mrs May at Number 10. Speculation swirled at the weekend that Mr Carney was considering leaving the job in 2018.  When he accepted the post in 2012, he committed to serving the first five years of his term but left open the option of extending to the full eight.  His critics claim the bank produced doom-laden forecasts for the UK economy to boost the Remain campaign. Political uncertainty  Financial markets, which have pummelled sterling since Britain voted to leave the EU in June, have been watching developments closely for signs of further political uncertainty.  Sterling hardly moved on the news, suggesting it will be difficult for the currency to shake off the damage inflicted by the repeated assaults on the central bank's competence and independence. Mr Carney is understood to want to help steer the UK economy through the divorce negotiations with Brussels once the UK government triggers article 50 in March next year.  - (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)",0,,,,,,
125,Irish Independent,12/05/2011,Bank of England signals rate hike as inflation to reach 5pc,"BRITISH inflation may hit 5pc while its economy continues to struggle, Bank of England governor Mervyn King said yesterday.  Mr King said inflation remains ""uncomfortably high"" while his officials signaled they may need to raise interest rates later this year to fight price rises.  Inflation ""remains uncomfortably high and well above the 2pc target. And there is a good chance that if utility prices rise further later in the year, inflation will reach 5pc,"" he told reporters yesterday.  Britain is the Republic's largest trading partner and is a particularly important export market for many small companies and farmers. Inflation there has been rising rapidly as the Bank of England effectively prints pound notes under its quantitative easing policy. Printing money almost inevitably leads to inflation.  Britain's economic recovery has stalled in the last six months and massive public spending cuts that are now starting to bite pose a serious threat to consumer demand. Retailers Sainsbury's and Kesa both warned of a challenging year ahead as consumers tightened their belts.  The road to economic recovery will be rocky but the coalition government is as committed as ever to slashing a record budget deficit, Chancellor George Osborne said. Mr Osborne said the government was on track to all but eliminate a deficit running at close to 10pc of national output over four years and did not see the need to further hike taxes or cut spending.  The Bank of England revised its forecasts downwards, predicting there would be a more gradual recovery in consumption and a less-pronounced boost from net exports than previously expected.  Inflation is persisting in many parts of the world, putting pressure on central banks to withdraw stimulus and raise interest rates. In China, inflation held above 5pc in April and lending exceeded analysts' estimates, according to reports yesterday.  Germany's rate jumped to 2.7pc, more than initially estimated, according to separate data. That will pile pressure on the European Central Bank to hike interest rates for eurozone countries.  The problem is leaving many policy makers confused. The Bank of England said yesterday there was ""a high degree of uncertainty, and an unusually wide range of views among committee members, about the strength of these various forces, and therefore around the overall outlook for inflation.""  The bank said while risks to growth are ""skewed to the downside"", surveys and growth in employment in recent months ""suggest that underlying activity may have been stronger than indicated by official output data"".  Temporary factors, such as the additional bank holiday for the royal wedding last month and the impact from the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, ""are likely to add some volatility"".  The pound gained against the euro and the dollar after the Bank of England said it sees inflation ""markedly higher"" in the near term, boosting speculation that borrowing costs will rise from record low levels.  ""The reaction of the pound is predominantly due to the admission that inflation is going to hit 5pc at some point this year,"" said Elizabeth Gregory, a Geneva-based market strategist at Swissquote Bank. ""The Bank of England doesn't have the luxury of waiting for growth to solidify if it wants to maintain its credibility. They're going to have to hike by at least the third quarter and possibly again in the fourth quarter."" ",0,,,,,,
126,The Irish Times,07/11/2008,Bank of England's 'bold' interest rate cut is barely adequate,"ANALYSIS:Demand stimulus is all important as inflation is no longer a threat, writes Samuel Brittan THOSE WHOSE economic experience has been confined to the decade or so of steady growth and low inflation in the UK and the euro zone might be surprised to find me saying that the ""bold"" cut of 1&frac12; percentage points in official interest rates announced yesterday by the Bank of England is barely adequate and will probably need to be followed by further cuts soon. Official interest rates have in this period normally moved by a quarter percentage point at a time, with even half a point regarded as exceptional. But these are not normal times. The big difference in diagnosis is between those who still think in terms of a conventional business cycle with output fluctuating in familiar snakelike fashion around a stable trend given by ""supply side"" factors, and those who believe that something more apocalyptic has happened. For this first group it is important to worry about the size of the current budget deficit, re-establishing fiscal guidelines in the medium-term and the maintenance of an arm's length relationship between governments and central banks. The obvious exponent of this view has been the European Central Bank, with its insistence that its economic task is to maintain the stability of a consumer price index. Its limited half-percentage-point cut in its base rate to 3.25 per cent shows how reluctant it is to abandon this point of view. At the other extreme are those who believe we are now in a new game where the cliche about the old rules no longer applying is for once correct and that a successful demand stimulus can influence the future output trend and not merely fluctuations around it. Central banks and governments need to co-operate to provide this stimulus. Inflation is a rapidly receding danger, and central bankers who worry about inflationary expectations setting off a wage-price spiral are like generals fighting the last war. More significant are the sporadic stories beginning to appear worldwide of workers accepting wage cuts to protect jobs. The obvious champion of the second, revisionist, view is the US Fed. Its chairman Ben Bernanke, who is a distinguished authority on the Great Depression, will need no prodding from the president-elect to use unorthodox means to maintain nominal spending. Critics say that Alan Greenspan's reduction of the Fed funds rate to 1 per cent in 2003 sparked off the recent credit bubble and its subsequent collapse. They do not say what else should have been done to prevent Asian savings surpluses from generating a world depression. But even if it is conceded that Mr Greenspan went down too far for too long, Mr Bernanke now faces a radically different situation in which the very existence of the US and world monetary systems has been threatened. Not long ago the Bank of England might have been said to be somewhere in between the two camps. But recent utterances, even before yesterday's cut, have placed it nearer the revisionist one. For instance, Mervyn King, the governor, has said that ""not since the first World War has the banking system been so close to collapse"" and that the ""economic news over the past month has probably been the worst in such a period for a very considerable time"". Why then has the monetary policy committee not immediately slashed the bank rate to somewhere near the US Fed funds rate, now again at 1 per cent? The normal argument for gradual changes is uncertainty about the course of the economy. The only uncertainty now, however, is about how far the UK recession will go. On present evidence, it looks deeper than either the US or the euro zone one. The only plausible argument against moving down by several percentage points at a time is the sense of panic it might generate. One response might be to move down in a series of frequent steps, which would mean abandoning the bank's self-imposed timetable of monthly intervals. Interest rates matter mainly for their effect on money flows. The combination of banking turmoil and changes in rules and definitions makes it almost impossible to say what has been happening to the money supply. What is clear is that MV - the product of money times velocity, also measured by our old friend nominal gross domestic product - has had a severe check. According to Goldman Sachs's estimates, UK nominal GDP growth, after hovering in the past few years in a range of 4-7 per cent a year, has now ground to a standstill. Many analysts fear that central banks will soon have ""run out of ammunition"" because official interest rates cannot fall below zero. This is the famous ""zero interest rate bound"" known as Zirb to its friends. Bernanke, then a Fed governor, showed that this is not the case in speeches during the 2002-03 deflation scare. To begin with, central banks can expand the range of securities in which they deal, as they are to some extent now doing. But the ultimate weapon would be a fiscal stimulus financed by money creation - the equivalent of the famous helicopter drop. You could call this monetary policy made effective, or fiscal policy supported on the monetary side, according to taste. If you are too hidebound to countenance this move you deserve to run the risk of a severe slump.",0,,,,,,
127,The Irish Times,04/10/2002,Bank warns benchmarking may lead to hike in taxes,"The Government will have to increase taxes or borrowings or cut services to pay for the benchmarking review of public service pay, the Central Bank said yesterday. Calling for wage moderation in an autumn bulletin that repeated its 3 per cent growth forecast, the bank's head of economic research, Mr Tom O'Connell, said the additional funds were needed to pay for the benchmarking review. Noting what he described as a ""small"" Government deficit this year of E750 million, Mr O'Connell said the bank's primary concern was to contain excessive growth in public spending. The froth had come off Government revenues as economic growth fell to sustainable levels after double-digit growth in 2000. 02100400119 The overall economic climate was uncertain and the domestic economy was stable. ""We're not doing a lot more than just ticking over,"" Mr O'Connell said. On benchmarking, which will increase public sector pay by an average of 8.9 per cent, he said: ""If one type of spending has large increases, something has to give."" The money would have to be raised through taxation, borrowing or by cutting services, he said. The general rise in spending should be cut to 8 per cent in 2003 from 23 per cent this year, he said, sounding a warning about the public finances a day after the Government admitted for the first time that it would not return a surplus this year. The surplus was likely despite expenditure cuts of E300 million. ""The maintenance of a broad balance in the public finances would require public spending increases to be limited to the likely trend increases in Government revenue,"" said the bank. Mr O'Connell compared the domestic growth projection with forecasts that the US and EU economies would expand by 1 per cent this year. But while risks internationally were on the downside and domestic ""warning lights"" were flashing, the bank cautioned against talking the economy into a crisis. It said individual items of economic data were sometimes overplayed in the media. An international pick-up was likely it said, suggesting the Irish economy could expand by 4.75 per cent next year. Such an expansion would be regarded as very strong in the US or EU, the bank said. Mr O'Connell offered no opinion when asked whether the special saving incentive account scheme should be withdrawn to ease pressure on the public finances, stating that the bank did not comment on individual policy matters. The bank said wage increases generally should be eased to reduce inflationary pressure on the economy. Stating that Irish wages had increased by more than three times the European average, it said that national wage negotiation should take lower economic growth into account. Failure to reach a new national agreement in talks that commence this autumn would not be a disaster, the bank said. Domestic inflation was Europe's highest and it was constraining job creation and reducing competitiveness in most sectors of the economy. Its effect was that Irish prices were significantly higher than those in the euro zone. ""Higher inflation here relative to the euro area is no longer a sustainable phenomenon. The Irish economy has largely come through the process of structural change and modernisation. As a consequence, the argument rationalising higher inflation here, based on our transition to a more modern economy, is not tenable,"" it said. The bank said there was little scope for a discretionary fiscal stimulus due to the erosion of the budget surplus and inflation. It said increased competition and the removal of restrictive practices and barriers to entry were crucial factors in reducing inflation. Consumer sentiment, page 2",0,,,,,,
128,Irish Independent,06/10/2007,Banks use ECB funds to get through credit crisis,"IRISH banks have been making use of funding from the European Central Bank to get them through the credit crisis, but their borrowings have fallen back to more normal levels, the Central Bank said yesterday.  But the Bank remains uncertain about the impact of the global banking crisis on the economy. In its quarterly bulletin, it urges Finance Minister Brian Cowen to bring in a cautious Budget, in case things turn out worse than expected in 2008.  Yesterday the European Central Bank said the cost to banks of borrowing from each other is still close to its highest level in more than six years. At 4.76pc, it is more than three quarters of a percentage point above the ECB's own rate.  In an early release of its monthly report, the ECB said the high interest rates suggested banks would remain unwilling to lend money to companies and consumers in the next three months. Banks also reported tightened credit standards in the third quarter.  Irish Central Bank assistant director general Tom O'Connell said uncertainty in the international banking system was making economic forecasts for next year more difficult.  ""The downside risks have increased. We can't be sure how banks are going to respond -- are they going to take a tougher view of lending to business and so on?  He said Irish banks' applications for funds from the ECB appeared to have been in line with that in the Eurozone generally.  ""There was no sign that they needed more funding than others. But the interbank market is still not functioning properly and banks are still risk averse.""  The Central Bank itself has reduced its economic forecasts, based on the global uncertainty and the decline in Irish house building.  It now expects national income (GNP) to grow by 3.25pc next year, down from an earlier estimate of 4pc.  The Central Bank expects 65,000 houses to be completed this year, which would be a 10,000 fall on this year's estimate.  Many other analysts now expect an even bigger fall. Yesterday, economists at AIB said they now thought the total would drop to 57,000.  ""The accelerating fall in registrations to start new houses has led us to cut our 2008 forecast again,"" said AIB chief economist John Beggs. ""They provide a guide to completions nine months ahead, which suggests they may well be running below 60,000 a year by the middle of 2008.""  Faced with such uncertainty, the Bank said Mr Cowen shouldplan for a Budget surplus next year, even though the economy will grow more slowly. ""We think it would be wise to allow for the fact that things might be even weaker,"" Mr O'Connell said.  ""If house completions were less than 50,000, for instance, the public finances could move quickly into deficit. We don't want them to come close to the 3pc of GDP limit in the Stability and Growth Pact. That would force damaging corrective action from spending cuts or tax rises in a slowing economy.""

129,The Irish Times,07/05/2010,Beginner's guide to the euro debt crisis,"What is the bond market and why has the Greek rescue package not succeeded in convincing markets? As for Ireland what is the best- and worst-case scenario? 1 Why do countries have to borrow? What are bonds? We elect governments to run countries and to do things the private sector would not do efficiently, eg the police force or social welfare transfers. Governments have no money of their own; their spending must be covered by taxes. If they spend more than they take in, they bridge the gap by borrowing. Unlike most normal people, governments rarely pay back their borrowing. However, if they cease borrowing for a period then debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) can fall to low levels, as happened in Ireland during the Celtic Tiger. All governments reacted to the current crisis by running unprecedented budget deficits and borrowing the difference. As a result, euro-area debt rose from 66 per cent in 2007 to 85 per cent this year. The Irish and Greek figures are 25 to 77 per cent and 96 to 125 per cent respectively. Countries borrow in many ways, from deposits in the post office to long-term bonds. A bond is an IOU which promises to pay back the amount borrowed at a certain date with a series of interest payments in the meantime. Hence the expression, my word is my bond . 2 What went wrong with the Greek economy? Why can t they borrow any more? Even when times were good, Greece had very high borrowings and debt. Some years back it engaged in accounting tricks to keep the ratio down; close to 100 per cent of GDP. Basically, it overspent and undertaxed but some of this was concealed in the returns it sent to Brussels. The revelation, by a government that was newly elected last September, that its deficits in recent years were wildly understated sent shock waves through the markets, which began to doubt that it could continue without major adjustment. Greece now has the highest debt burden and the largest interest-rate bill of the euro countries. The market effectively stopped lending to Greece, forcing it to call in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the EU. The same would have happened to us had the Government not begun to address the deficit in 2008. 3 Why does it matter? Why don t they just default or reschedule their debt? Is that not what countries do when they can t repay their debts? Less-developed countries default or reschedule their debts. A euro country has never defaulted and lenders to such countries, typically large pension funds as well as a multitude of other investors, do not expect to lose their money. It would thus be regarded as a very bad precedent. The Greek programme agreed with the IMF and the other member states seeks to avoid default almost at any cost; instead it envisages swingeing cuts in government spending and higher taxes. This is very unpopular in Greece, which has no tradition of balancing the books. Greeks are protesting on the streets about cuts in pay and social welfare. However, the alternative is worse, for without external assistance Greece would run out of funds to pay wages and social welfare within a month. 4 Who or what is the bond market ? Are they rational investors managing people s savings or greedy sociopaths? The main buyers of sovereign debt are typically pension funds and other institutions looking for stable long-term investment returns to match their liabilities: the pensions they must pay to their customers. In totality they, along with various other classes of investors, make up the bond market . But as with all assets, government debt attracts speculators looking to make short-term profits from market events rather than hold the investment for the long term. The prospect of a Greek default is the sort of event that speculators would find attractive. 5 Why has the EUR 120 billion rescue package not succeeded in convincing the market that Greece will not default? (Do people not believe that the Greek government and people can implement the required reforms?) The EUR 120 billion removes the need for Greece to borrow for more than two years. It does not guarantee that Greece can make the adjustments necessary to regain the confidence of the markets and resume borrowing in a few years time. Ireland was able to resume borrowing immediately because there was confidence that the Government would deliver. Some fear that Greece may be forced to the ultimate option of restructuring or delaying the repayment of its debt anyway. So the markets have kept the quoted rates for Greek borrowing very high. This does not matter at the moment given that Greece will not be tapping them for funds, but it is a sign of lack of confidence. 6 Is there a chance that it could still work and the markets will start to believe Greece can pay its debts and everything will calm down? Yes if Greece delivers on its austerity package, sentiment could change at any stage over the next two years. 7 Is there anything that can be done in the short term to calm the market? What about this weekend s summit of EU leaders, for example? Very little. The problem now is not Greece but the spread of contagion to others. It is unlikely that either the IMF or the EU would make a major change at this stage to the Greek plan. Lingering doubts about whether the German parliament will ratify the deal are another factor. The summit this weekend is likely to put pressure on all concerned to pass the necessary legislation quickly, thereby removing one source of uncertainty. The European Central bank (ECB) is under some pressure to help ease the strain, by buying Greek bonds indirectly for instance. ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet seemed to rule this out yesterday, saying it had not even been discussed. 8 Why is the apparent failure of the Greek rescue package causing such a problem for the wider euro zone? It raises doubts about the euro zone s solidarity and ability to protect members, and opens the door to speculation against other weak candidates such as Portugal, Spain, Italy, Ireland and, possibly, the UK. 9 Why is the euro so weak? It is weak because investors are putting their money elsewhere given the uncertainty about Greece and other peripheral states. The turmoil surrounding Greece has added to the doubts about the viability of the single currency. The euro has fallen by about 10 per cent since late 2009. This is helping member countries gain competitiveness and boost exports in much the same way as the UK is doing. It also relieves pressure on Irish exporters to the UK. 10 What is all this talk about a Greek default precipitating a fresh banking crisis? Many European banks are big holders of Greek government debt and would suffer substantial losses if Greece defaulted. Some fear that the losses could be so big that it would result in a rerun of the 2008/2009 banking crisis which was triggered by the losses incurred by banks on subprime mortgages. 11Are Portugal, Spain and Italy really in the same boat as Greece? Yes and no. They face similar budgetary problems to Greece as do we and will have to demonstrate to the market that they can get their deficits back under control. However, various other mitigating factors, such as Spain and Portugal s relatively low level of debt, differentiate them from Greece and mean it is feasible for them to borrow more and manage their way out of difficulty. 12 When will Portugal s problems come to a head? If and when speculation shifts to them. The debt markets are still open to Portugal and it raised a EUR 500 million six-month loan on Tuesday. However, it had to pay an interest rate six times higher than it paid for a similar loan in January. It has to repay another loan of EUR 4.6 billion on May 30th, but after that it does not have any loans falling due until April next year. The government will have to demonstrate that it is tackling its deficit between then and now. Last week it announced further measures. 13 If it came down to it, could the other euro-zone members not help Portugal in the way they are helping Greece? Yes the amounts involved in supporting Portugal are small relative to the funds spent to resolve the banking crisis in Europe. 14 But what happens if/when Spain gets into trouble? Or Italy? Getting harder, but could still be doable if there was sufficient will. At that stage everything would hinge on whether Germany was prepared to support a bailout on that scale. 15 Is the euro zone doomed then, or is that just scare-mongering? It would be in serious trouble if Spain was to be forced into a default, which is unlikely to happen. But in extremis it would collapse to a small number of states, possibly the five that Germany wanted in the euro zone in the first instance that is the original six minus Italy. 16 What needs to happen to remove the risk of something as catastrophic as a Spanish default destroying the euro? Do we need some sort of systemic response or a mechanism to allow countries to leave the euro and default/reschedule their debt? The obvious solution is closer fiscal union allowing direct transfers between states, as is the case in the US. The next-best solution would be a European IMF that would give the market confidence that the euro zone could deal with a fiscal crisis in a member state despite the lack of an underlying fiscal union. But establishing such a structure could take some time and would probably require the reopening of existing European treaties. Plans for closer scrutiny of member states books are to be announced next week. As things stand it is not possible for members to leave the euro zone. Even if they did, their debts would remain in euro so it would not solve their immediate fiscal problems. However, if they left they could then default without consequences for the remaining members. 17 Are these sorts of solutions realistic given what we know about the dynamic within Europe? Could Germany not just cut and run? As with so much that we have witnessed in the past year, a German exit was unthinkable until now. But it is probably no less fraught or difficult a process than the creation of a European IMF or implementing any of the other long-term solutions being proposed to address the lack of a fiscal union in the common currency area. But now that this fundamental weakness in the euro zone has been exposed, it will have to be addressed if the euro is to be viable in the long term. A German exit while it might have political appeal at home is not necessarily in Germany s interest. The setting up of a new deutsche mark would in effect mean it has allowed all the other euro-zone or former euro-zone countries to devalue against it, which would damage hard-won German competitiveness. 18 What is the best- and worst-case scenario for Ireland? The best option is that the Greek bailout works and we return to (relative) life as normal. Even under this scenario we may have to accept higher borrowing costs as markets remain nervous about Greece. The worst case is that the bond markets lose faith in Ireland because of what happens in Greece and other peripheral countries. Then we are faced with seeking EU help and if that is not available then IMF help. Either way it will involve a tougher austerity package.",0,,,,,,
130,Irish Independent,26/11/2007,Beleaguered Bertie is just crawling towards Christmas,"THE queue of volunteers planning to stuff Bertie Ahern's turkey this Christmas gets longer by the day.  An invigorated opposition and a tortoise-paced tribunal are vying for the privilege, but an exasperated electorate beat them both to the punch.  Yesterday's opinion poll shows that the electorate has lost patience with Fianna Fail's incompetence in government. And the only good news for its leader is that it didn't measure the public's regard for him.  The seven per cent collapse of support for Fianna Fail and a corresponding rise in popularity for Fine Gael and the Labour Party is ominous for the Taoiseach.  Privately, some senior Fianna Failers are saying that if the Red C poll had asked voters about the Taoiseach's performance, his standing would have been even lower than the party's.  And that could mean that Fianna Fail and Bertie Ahern, a 10-year, three-term political Darby and Joan, will be soon be seeking a separation rather than reconciliation counselling.  The poll in the Sunday Business Post also indicated that the public believe that the government misled them in the general election campaign.  This catastrophic collapse in support just days before a crucial no-confidence motion in the Dail comes while a tribunal hears about highly questionable goings-on in the Taoiseach's personal finances.  Throw in seething public anger over a fat pay hike for ministers and the government's call for pay restraint from PAYE taxpayers and continuing crises in the health service.  Then add on deep foreboding about a crash in property prices and well-grounded fears about an economic slow-down, and a pattern begins to emerge.  This poll, just before the Budget, suggests that An Taoiseach's personal credibility is perilously close to bankruptcy and that the electorate has lost faith in the government.  Beleaguered Fianna Fail ministers and their hapless advisors have that blank stare of exhaustion as they try to put the government on automatic pilot and cruise into the Christmas holiday.  A break until the Dail returns in the last week of January would buy time and allow them to regroup while the public slips into annual festive amnesia.  Christmas is a disinfectant that scrubs away old bad news and allows another chance of renewal with resolutions after New Year's Day.Problems that appeared so ominous two weeks before usually fall into perspective after the January sales.  Not-so-old hands remember that a similar hullabaloo erupted after the 2002 election, with a similar collapse in the government's popularity amid comparable accusations.  Five years ago it was Charlie McCreevy who was pilloried for over-spending before the election and then implementing cutbacks following some contrived change-of-circumstances after it was won.  Fianna Fail ran the race from the 2002 election to the rerun on May 24 last like marathon runners: they stayed back while the opposition blustered and exhausted themselves.  Just three weeks before polling day on May 24, the polls said that Fianna Fail would not be leading a government after the election. In the final week of campaigning, though leadership debates and the steadying hand of Brian Cowen, they scraped through.  The government's argument was that things were going to slow down, and in times of economic uncertainty, the country was better off with an experienced team in cabinet.  The economic projections they made were based on the same figures available to the opposition, so the charge that they misled the public doesn't stand up.  But then the truth doesn't matter as much as the perception and the public now believe that the Fianna Fail-led government did mislead them.  Conventional wisdom has it that faced with a choice: a Fine Gael-led coalition that hadn't won an election since 1983, or a third-term Fianna Fail led government. And the public stuck with the devil they knew.  For such an experienced politician whose reputation was built on an uncanny insight into the public mood, Bertie Ahern didn't see the ministerial pay hike as deal-breaker.  Giving themselves and senior public servants a massive pay rise was an enormous political mistake. And calling on PAYE workers for pay restraint compounded the perceived arrogance.  As the highest paid head of government in the world of democratically elected politicians, the Taoiseach's protestations about the perks of others were deeply irritating.  But more ominous for him, it showed grievously flawed judgement.  As the markets sagged and plummeted and property prices tottered on the edge of the unknown, another appalling vista loomed: a health service apparently out of control.  Watching women queue for hours over the weekend at a makeshift health centre in Portlaoise for emergency cancer tests was a harrowing sight to behold.  A vote of no-confidence in the minister administratively responsible for the health service was as inevitable as s wave of public anger followed the grim news on cancer testing from Portlaoise.  Last May, people decided to stick with the government they knew to manage public services rather than change.The news from the public this weekend suggests they might now be ready for that change.

131,The Irish Times,30/01/2012,Berlin seeks enforcement powers over Greece on budget policy,"GERMANY HAS confirmed it wants an EU-appointed budget commissioner sent to Greece with powers to override its government s budget policy. Berlin s demand would also apply to Ireland and any other bailout recipient that consistently missed the targets set out in its rescue plans, a well-placed European source said yesterday. The source recognised that Ireland s bailout was on track but said Berlin was anxious to avoid any repeat of the Greek situation, where the authorities have repeatedly failed to implement promised reforms. Greece is resisting the pressure from Germany. Anyone who puts a nation before the dilemma of economic assistance or national dignity ignores some key historical lessons, said finance minister Evangelos Venizelos. The prospect of an Irish referendum to endorse Europe s new fiscal treaty hangs in the balance as EU leaders make a final push today for a pact to toughen the enforcement of budget rules. The core aim of EU leaders today is to conclude a two-month negotiation of their new fiscal pact. While there is some confidence in Dublin that the individual terms of the draft agreement may not require a plebiscite, serious uncertainty remains as to whether a vote would be needed to endorse the overall package. EU leaders resolved last month to pursue an international treaty, operating outside the framework of European law, after British prime minister David Cameron vetoed a new EU treaty. Most of the text is agreed, although non-euro Poland is still insisting on the right to attend summits of euro zone leaders. At issue now for the Government is the principle of adopting an international treaty, which will impose binding obligations on the Dáil and Seanad, without the consent of the people. Even if the Cabinet decides in the light of the Attorney General s advice that no referendum is required, this question is considered likely to feature in any Supreme Court challenge. Such a challenge is considered inevitable at this point, meaning the final decision on a referendum will be in the hands of the court. The Government fears defeat in any vote and its objective in treaty talks was to ensure a referendum would not be required. Senior Irish sources are confident the core of the final draft, agreed on Friday, will emerge unchanged today. Crucial from the Government s perspective is Germany s decision to tone down its demand for constitutional limits on debt and budget deficits. As it now stands, the text calls for a preferably constitutional basis for such limits, leaving scope for Dublin to enact the measures in secondary legislation.  It s a fine call but, on balance, we re okay, said one Irish official of the referendum question. But in public the Government has insisted no decision on a referendum can be made until the Attorney General completes her assessment. Yesterday, Minister of State for European Affairs Lucinda Creighton said it would be about two weeks before it is known if a referendum needs to be held. We won t have advice from the Attorney General probably for a couple of weeks, she said. We have to agree the text first and she needs the opportunity to scrutinise it, analyse it and come to her own informed view. ",1,debt,public debts,,,,EU
132,The Irish Times,18/11/2011,Berlin's MPs shrug off controversy over budget information,"LEAKED DOCUMENTS:Scrutiny of finance plans deemed to be a day-to day reality for a country in receipt of funds from EFSF GERMAN MPs have expressed surprise at the controversy in Ireland over budget information being given to the Bundestag before the Dáil. On Wednesday, Berlin s federal finance ministry forwarded the latest quarterly troika documents, including a letter of intent from Minister for Finance Michael Noonan, to the Bundestag budgetary committee. This procedure is in line with German guidelines for participation in the EFSF bailout fund. To release Germany s contribution to each EFSF tranche, the federal finance ministry has first to secure the approval of the 41-member committee. Surprise in Berlin at the reaction in Dublin was tempered by a reluctance by officials to go on the record for fear, as one member put it, of remarks being misconstrued .  What s happened is the federal government meeting its legal information to inform the Bundestag about the EFSF, said one committee member from the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU). This is widely known and seems unproblematic from our perspective. This is the day-to-day reality of a programme country.  Another committee member added: We realise that it s taken a while for this reality to hit in Ireland. But there are some programme countries in the euro zone that aren t even this far.  In a letter of intent, seen by The Irish Times, the Minister for Finance Michael Noonan promises to increase the top VAT rate by two points in the 2012 budget to 23 per cent, raising EUR 670 million for the exchequer. Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin said on RTÉ yesterday that the notion that anything has been decided is untrue . A senior member of the Bundestag budgetary committee, when asked if any programme country had not implemented a measure as laid out in a letter of intent, said: No, that hasn t happened, and would be counterproductive.  The federal government in Berlin played down the significance of the documents yesterday. Acknowledging that national budgetary policy is a sensitive matter, Berlin pointed out that opening budgetary policy to outside scrutiny was the central condition and day-to-day reality of the bailout programme. All EU member states have agreed to a new European Semester of budgetary oversight by Brussels from next year.  This is the shape of things to come.  We re going to have to talk a lot more to each other about our budget process, that s a lesson of the crisis, said a German government official.  There s no rule that you have to give German MPs information before your own.  Two days ago, finance ministry state secretary Steffen Kampeter sent the latest troika documents, dated November 11th, to the heads of the Bundestag budgetary committee, which were forwarded to all 41 members.  The commission comes to the conclusion that programme implementation in Ireland continues to be on track, writes Mr Kampeter in a cover letter. Important progress has been reached, in particular in the financial sector and in the implementation of growth-oriented structure.  The programme s fiscal targets have even been over fulfilled.  In his summary, Mr Kampeter warns that the the market trust won back by Ireland is, however, still fragile .  A possible risk to stability is seen in external risks, such as an economic cool-off in Europe. To prevent further uncertainty in markets, Ireland has to continue consequentially down the austerity and reform path.   Against the backdrop of the successful implementation of the programme in the third quarter 2011 the federal government is in favour of the payment of the fourth credit tranche to Ireland.  Summarising the troika report, Mr Kampeter writes: The risks Ireland faces are external in nature.  Ireland s strength, a competitive export sector, is linked to a high dependence on external demand.  In addition to this cover letter, German budget committee MPs were given the full troika report, a 40-page document issued by the European Commission s directorate general for economic and financial affairs, dated October 28th. In addition, they received four confidential draft programme documents including letters of intent from the Department of Finance to the EU authorities and the IMF, a memorandum of economic and financial policies and a third update of the memorandum of specific economic policy conditionality . All of the documents were provided both in the Commission s original English version and in German translation. The letter of intent from Mr Noonan ends: We authorise the IMF and the European Commission to publish the letter of intent and its attachments, and the related staff report. ",0,,,,,,
133,The Irish Times,22/07/2010,Bernanke says Fed prepared to bolster growth,"FEDERAL RESERVE chairman Ben Bernanke said the US economy faces unusually uncertain prospects, and that the central bank was ready to take further steps to bolster growth if needed.  Even as the Federal Reserve continues prudent planning for the ultimate withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation, we also recognise that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain, Mr Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee.  We remain prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilisation of our nation s productive potential in a context of price stability.  Mr Bernanke, delivering the central bank s semi-annual report to Congress on monetary policy, said Fed officials believe the US economy is still on a path to recovery.  Although fiscal policy and inventory restocking will likely be providing less impetus to the recovery than they have in recent quarters, rising demand from households and businesses should help sustain growth, Mr Bernanke said. For now, he said the Fed expects economic conditions will warrant an exceptionally low benchmark federal funds rate for an extended period repeating a vow the central bank has kept in place for more than a year. Mr Bernanke stopped short of describing what steps the Fed might take if growth were to falter. Analysts say the central bank could resume asset purchases or lower the rate it pays banks to park their excess reserves at the Fed.  The testimony was not particularly optimistic, said Lawrence Glazer, managing partner of Mayflower Advisors in Boston. It implied that the Fed had a relatively cloudy view of the future.  Stocks turned lower to trade down modestly after the testimony was released, while the dollar extended losses versus the yen and US treasuries rallied, with the 30-year bond gaining a full point. Stocks had risen on Tuesday in part on speculation the Fed could ease monetary conditions further. After emerging from its longest and deepest downturn since the Great Depression, the US economy began expanding again about a year ago. It grew at an annualised 2.7 per cent in the first quarter. But stubbornly high unemployment, a fresh drop in housing activity and a slowdown in manufacturing have raised fears of a double dip recession. Mr Bernanke spent much of his testimony reviewing tools the Fed has at its disposal to remove the extraordinary monetary stimulus pumped into the economy during the 2007-2009 crisis. He said there was broad agreement among Fed officials that asset sales will eventually play a role in withdrawing some of that accommodation. But he also noted that any such sales would be flagged well in advance. (Reuters)",1,monetary,future prospects,,,,usa
134,Irish Independent,05/10/2011,Bernanke says the Fed will act to bolster US economy," economy  FEDERAL Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank stands ready to take additional steps to boost US growth and cautioned lawmakers against budget moves that would harm a ""sluggish"" recovery in an economy ""close to faltering"".  The Fed ""will continue to closely monitor economic developments and is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability"", Mr Bernanke said yesterday, in testimony to Congress's Joint Economic Committee in Washington.  The remarks signal that Mr Bernanke may not be finished after attempts in August and September to strengthen record monetary stimulus with unconventional tools. The central bank's near-zero benchmark interest rate and $2.3 trillion of housing and government-debt purchases since 2008 have failed to produce self-sustaining growth in the economy.  Lawmakers on the separate bipartisan congressional supercommittee charged with seeking $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction by November 23 would take a ""substantial step"" by accomplishing that goal, Mr Bernanke said.  At the same time, ""more will be needed to achieve fiscal sustainability,"" he added.  ""A second important objective is to avoid fiscal actions that could impede the ongoing economic recovery,"" Mr Bernanke said. ""Putting in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the longer term does not preclude attending to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term,"" he added, without being more specific.  Mr Bernanke said the economy was growing more slowly than the Federal Reserve had expected and that the biggest factor depressing consumer confidence was poor job growth.""We need to make sure that the recovery continues and doesn't drop back and that the unemployment rate continues to fall downward.""  He also told the Joint Economic Committee that lawmakers faced a delicate challenge: they must avoid making deep spending cuts that could impede the recovery.  He said the US banking system had manageable exposure to European nations buffeted by the sovereign debt crisis.  ""We have looked very carefully at bank exposures both to foreign sovereigns and to foreign banks. The exposures of US banks to the most troubled sovereigns -- Portugal, Ireland and Greece -- is quite minimal. So the direct exposures there are not large.""  Mr Bernanke said questions about the solvency of European nations and the stability of banks had created an ""enormous amount of uncertainty"" in financial markets, and volatility was one reason why the US economic recovery had been slower than projected this year.

135,The Irish Times,26/08/2011,Bernanke to act as US confidence plummets,"ANALYSIS:With faith in markets threadbare, US central banker is expected to try to boost economy WITH GROWING concerns about a double-dip recession, there will be much focus today on an obscure ski resort in middle America. As the world s central bankers gather in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for their annual think-in, expectations are high that the US central bank boss Ben Bernanke will signal additional unconventional monetary measures in an attempt to propel his economy forward. Recent economic data have only reinforced the demand for action. Last week, a US business confidence indicator for July was published. It caused shock waves. Its collapse, deep into negative territory, was massive and suggested that confidence among corporate executives had returned to levels last seen in February 2009 when the world economy was sliding towards depression. It was tempting to dismiss it as a rogue result. It may well have been. But this week, two further surveys on this side of the Atlantic give reason to be concerned that sustained financial fragility has begun to batter both business and consumer confidence. On Wednesday, Germany s most-watched business survey of 7,000 management types expectations for the coming half-year registered its biggest monthly decline in July since the Ifo index went over a cliff in 2008. While the July expectations index remained high by historical standards, the downturn last month is a sharp acceleration of a dip in progress since the spring. This week s EU-wide survey of consumer confidence registered an unusually large decline in August. Again, it amounted to an acceleration of a trend that has been evidence across the continent since the spring. For Ireland, there are signs that the Euro-American slowdown is having an effect on Irish exporters. The June trade figures published earlier this week were as good as could have been hoped for. Goods exports rose solidly month on month and remain at a high level. But the trend suggests that last year s strong growth is running out of steam exports for the full second quarter were down on the first quarter. If the week ends with attention on central bankers, over most of the rest of the week it was hard to ignore some euro-zone leaders making their own crisis worse. Finland led a charge against Greece to seek collateral on its bailout loans to the crippled Greek government. This raised further questions about Greece s prospects of ever repaying private holders of its debt. As a result, its bond yields broke yet another new record yesterday. Other than that, the euro area bond market enjoyed a week of unusual calm, bolstered by more constructive announcements in Madrid and Paris that greater efforts would be made to reduce very large Spanish and French budget deficits. Remarkably, given all the uncertainty, yields on Irish bonds did better than most, continuing their month-long moderation over the course of the week. Yesterday they passed another threshold, as the yield on the 10-year fell below 9 per cent. That brings the decline since the mid-July peak to five percentage points, pointing to a return of international faith in the Irish economy. Next Wednesday, the Central Bank will publish monthly banking statistics. The figures include the amount held on deposit in Ireland-based banks. Previous figures showed an uninterrupted, if moderating, shrinking of deposits from September of last year to June of this year. Next week s deposit numbers for July are likely to show that a further erosion of the banking system s deposit base took place last month. The severity of the euro crisis in July led to a flight to safety generally, and the Irish banks were almost certainly victims of that. But if the figures show that the deposit base did not fall, it would be a powerful piece of evidence, adding to bond market developments, of light at the end of the tunnel.",0,,,,,,
136,The Irish Times,28/08/2009,Bernanke's stewardship,"THE US is weathering the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, thanks in some measure to the skill and judgment of Ben Bernanke. As chairman of the Federal Reserve, America s central bank, he has helped pull the US economy back from the brink of depression and prevented a collapse of the global financial system. President Barack Obama has acknowledged that and nominated Mr Bernanke to a second term as Fed chairman.  Wisely, Mr Obama has opted for continuity rather than change as the US economy shows early signs of recovery. To take any other decision would have created uncertainty about the future direction of US economic policy, upset financial markets and unsettled foreign investors such as China on whom America greatly relies to finance its soaring budget deficit. Mr Bernanke, who was appointed by George W Bush, is a former Princeton University economics professor and acknowledged expert on the Great Depression. His expertise in this and other specialist areas of economics has proved important. Certainly, no Fed chairman has been intellectually better equipped to face the challenges presented by the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. The academic expert on the causes of the Great Depression became, as Mr Obama said, part of a team responsible for preventing another . One lesson Mr Bernanke has learned from economic history is that where policy-makers respond slowly and inadequately to financial crises as in the 1930s delay can mean the fiscal costs are often greater, and the economic consequences much worse. As Fed chairman, he moved quickly and successfully to prevent a recession becoming a depression by tackling deflation. The Fed cut interest rates close to zero last December and engaged in quantitative easing printing money by buying government bonds. It loaned to companies previously ineligible for central bank credit and rescued some big firms that were in difficulty. While these initiatives have helped to stabilise markets, they have also left Mr Bernanke open to criticism. His detractors charge that he has put taxpayers money at risk and claim the Fed s efforts to boost demand will have serious inflationary consequences in the longer term. Having pumped so much money into the economy, the challenge facing Mr Bernanke in his second term is how to manage and time the Fed s exit strategy: too quickly and he chokes off economic recovery; too slowly, and he causes inflation to rise.",0,,,,,,
137,The Irish Times,08/10/2008,Bertie basks as two Brians feel thoroughly scrambled,"DÁIL SKETCH:A PD councillor joined Fine Gael yesterday. Then news swept Leinster House that Charlie Bird is migrating to America. It's just one bombshell after another. We can't keep up. Thank heavens for the economic crisis. In these uncertain times, the nation needs a sense of normality. It was business as usual in the Dáil. Continuity was supplied by Taoiseach Brian Cowen who informed the House that we don't know where we're going, but we'll know when we get there. Or as he preferred to put it, ""this is an evolving situation"". Pity. The general consensus was that Brian should keep his hair the way it is. He got a smart new cut over the weekend. At least Biffo didn't have to endure a photographer outside the barber's shop, trying to sneak a picture through the window of him with his head in the sink. Poor Mary Harney wasn't so lucky. The Minister for Health paid a visit to a salon on Monday, and a photo of her with her hair dripping and a towel around her shoulders was published in a morning newspaper. Mary had the sympathy of every female in Leinster House, appalled at the thoughts of such an intrusion into what is always a difficult time for a woman. And then another councillor defected from the PDs. In the scale of terrible things, this was minor compared to the hair salon atrocity. Harney has already said her prayers over the mortal remains of the PDs, and Cllr Cáit Keane had the decency to remain in the party until the expiry date had passed. So before the day's business began in Leinster House, IndaKinny presided over a happy photocall in Fine Gael headquarters, welcoming Cllr Keane to the party fold. Times may be hard after so many years in Opposition, but to underline the mood of celebration, they went mad and laid on a plate of Club Milks. There were a lot of photographers, lured, no doubt, by the promise that Enda would be ""unveiling"" Cáit on the steps in Mount Street. Unless it rained. Then the procedure would be carried out indoors. She would have caught her death. For Cáit's first official day as a blueshirt, she posed with Dublin South deputies, Alan Shatter and Olivia Mitchell. ""I'm a realist,"" she said, bravely. Meanwhile, Kenny was at pains to stress his party was not hunting down vulnerable PDs. In fact, the homeless and disorientated PDs are throwing themselves on the traps. It wasn't long, though, before thoughts turned to ""The Crisis"". ""When I was called at 13 minutes to seven on Tuesday morning, I said that Fine Gael would stand by the economy,"" he quivered. You're nothing in Leinster House these days if you haven't had your sleep disrupted by the plight of our distressed bankers. IndaKinny was determined not to be left out. After the metaphorical unveiling of the former PD councillor, the troops returned to Kildare Street. Once there, they will have come across a press release from Sinn Féin's Arthur Morgan, who is his party's spokesman on their latest relationship with the banks. Sinn Féin has always enjoyed a unique relationship with banks. ""Morgan to set out minimum terms and conditions acceptable to Sinn Féin for deal with Irish banks,"" said the press release. The financial institutions must have been agog. In their hour of need, were they going to get some of their money back? Contemplation of ""The Crisis"" continued at Leaders' Questions, as the Opposition continued to press for details of the guarantee scheme. ""The scheme has not yet been approved by the Government. It's still at an advance stage of work being done on it,"" Brian Cowen told Enda. ""We are not out of the woods at this stage,"" he added, while deputies silently prayed that we won't end up savaged before the end of this particular teddy bears' picnic. The other Brian - in Luxembourg - was in everyone's thoughts during the exchanges. ""I think the Minister for Finance is reflecting on the issues that have been put to him in the finalisation of the detailed scheme,"" explained the Taoiseach. But we must not forget, the situation is evolving all the time. Evolving to such an extent that the provisional deadline for presenting details of the scheme to the Dáil appears to have moved from tomorrow's session to sometime next week. Never mind, for a celebrity arrived in the chamber late in the afternoon, providing a break from thoughts of the economy. The House was treated to a rare visit from ""The Office of Bertie Ahern"". He hasn't been seen in the place since he bowed out of office. Bertie came in for the Dáil's official expressions of sympathy on the death of Séamus Brennan. Given the welcome he got, Bertie might be inclined to visit more often. He was mobbed by wellwishers in Kildare Street as he made his way to the gates, and a group of besotted ladies on a day trip fell on him as soon as he reached the main hall. Once inside the chamber, the former taoiseach settled himself in the back row and looked around, like the daytrippers do in the public gallery. After the many fine tributes were paid to Séamus, Bertie made his way out, surrounded by deputies who clapped him on the back and shook his hand. He headed off to the restaurant and had chops and loads of chat for his tea. The two Brians prepared to go to a Cabinet meeting, brains scrambled by the bankers. God love them. No wonder Bertie looked happy.",0,,,,,,
138,The Irish Times,24/02/2001,Bertie enjoys Rome trip after a bad trip in the Dail,"'And there in the crowd is the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern,"" intoned the RTE woman in a hushed, almost reverential, tone. ""What a lovely day to be out"" . . . and Drapier was about to complete the sentence by saying ""out of the country"", but the woman said ""out in the open air"". Bertie was in Rome at the elevation of Dr Desmond Connell, and a welcome change it made from the hectic and at times pummelling experience he endured on Tuesday's Order of Business and would have experienced again had he been present on Wednesday and Thursday. Tuesday was one of Bertie's worst Dail days since becoming Taoiseach. And most of the damage was self-inflicted. Drapier put this question to an experienced Bertie-watcher: why can he not be straightforward? Why does he constantly vindicate Charlie Haughey's description of him as the ""most devious"" of them all? 01022400039 ""It's his nature,"" was the answer. ""He hates taking difficult decisions and reckons that if he sits on them long enough they go away. And in fact 90 per cent of them do."" The Ned O'Keeffe decision was the one that didn't. Bertie tied himself up in knots all weekend. There was sympathy for Ned over the extent of the spinning and briefing coming from the Taoiseach's Department. The press was told over and over again that if Ned did not go he would be pushed - and all this at a time when Ned had agreed to go. What was the point? Was it an attempt to portray Bertie in a tough-guy, decisive mode? If it was, it did not succeed. Indeed, there was general sympathy for Ned when he revealed that senior advisers in Bertie's office tried to bully him into resigning. We politicians can be a prickly lot and while we respect and depend on officials, we take great exception to advisers getting above themselves and behaving in a way which should be the preserve of party leaders or elected politicians. And we don't like to see our colleagues subject to media manipulation at the hands of faceless apparatchiks. Drapier has a view that Ned was hard done by and that the Public Offices Commission will find little against him. It's too late now and Ned was not his own best advocate in the controversy, but it has left an unsettled feeling on the back benches. The only good thing to come from it all is the appointment of Mary Coughlan as Minister of State. Mary comes from a family with a great tradition of public service. She deserved her break and few will say otherwise. The election of Michael Noonan and the shifting up a gear by Ruairi Quinn have certainly changed the atmosphere in here. It's much more unsettled than it was a few weeks ago. While Drapier does not believe the fundamentals have changed regarding an early general election, the atmosphere is different and in the new, highly charged situation accidents can, and usually do, happen. Whether any such accident will be enough to bring the whole show down is open to question but, as Albert Reynolds says, it's the small ones that do for you. The atmosphere now is more tense, aggressive and edgy than it has been for some time. Noonan has an air of menace about him on the Order of Business which clearly discomfits Ahern while Quinn is starting to find the type of form which has eluded him up to now. The Order of Business is now going to be a major battleground, especially with the addition of the topical questions from each of the party leaders. It's too early to say how the new system will work but in Drapier's view the Opposition has been given a potentially lethal weapon to raise uncomfortable issues on a daily basis in the chamber. The rivalry between Fine Gael and Labour is sharper now than it has been for some time. A good thing, Drapier feels, and the only real loser will be the Government as it will be the target of a sharpened and competitive opposition. Quinn upped the ante this week with his return to the days of street politics when he and his colleagues picketed the Fianna Fail headquarters on the question of political funding. It was an action which deeply angered many in Fianna Fail and Drapier predicts retaliation will not be long in coming. It was a pity some of the Labour members turned up at the wrong venue - the old Aras de Valera - rather than at the spanking new corporate building which now houses the Fianna Fail apparatus. However, the point was made that both opposition parties have put corporate funding top of their agenda and that Fianna Fail is looking increasingly flatfooted and defensive on the issue. On the question of an early election, Drapier sees little reason to change his mind. The TG4 poll in North Tipperary was bad news for Fianna Fail. The earlier poll in South Tipperary was not cheerful either and the Mayo figures send dangerous signals. Nor do the national polls, which did for John Bruton, provide a basis for the Government going to the country with confidence. On both the IMS and MRBI figures the only certainty is uncertainty, not a strong platform to launch a general election campaign. Drapier detects no pressure within the Government parties for an early election. In fact, Drapier is now more certain that Bertie intends sticking to his target of no election before the spring of 2002. Drapier has heard all the arguments, especially from some of the pundits who predict an election every other month. About things being worse a year from now, the US economy, danger of job losses in the multinationals, further fallout from the tribunals, inevitable ministerial cock-ups, lack of room to manoeuvre and many more. All have some validity. But the only real question is would the Government be re-elected; would Fianna Fail do better in an early election? If the answer to those questions is ""yes"", then go to the country. If the answer is ""no"" or ""not sure"", then sit tight, especially since there is no danger of losing a Dail vote. And Drapier can say quite emphatically, and for Bertie quite unambiguously, it's going to be ""sit tight"". It's all but certain now we will be off to South Tipperary in mid-March, probably in time to coincide with Cheltenham. Brian Lenihan has taken on the task of Fianna Fail director of elections but to judge by the recent poll it's going to be hard to stop Tom Hayes this time. He will be the only major party candidate of last June's by-election where he performed well, so at this stage he is clear favourite. But after last June Drapier doubts if anyone will take the hospitable people of South Tipperary for granted.",0,,,,,,
139,The Irish Times,23/12/2009,Better news on the economy,"TAOISEACH BRIAN Cowen has described 2009 as the most difficult period of his political life. The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) echoes his sentiments, describing the year as enormously difficult for the economy. However, in its quarterly commentary, it suggests the worst of the recession is virtually over and concurs with the outlook of the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement. For 2010, the ESRI forecasts the pace of economic contraction will slow sharply. An estimated decline of 10 per cent in Gross National Product this year will drop to a 1.5 per cent decline next year. Ireland was the first EU country to enter recession and the downturn here has been deeper and lasted much longer than elsewhere. Unsurprisingly in these circumstances, Ireland s rate of economic recovery will also be slower and less certain than most. But the ESRI does expect a reasonable pace of economic growth in 2011 . This year has seen stabilisation of the public finances. Next year will mark a transition period for the economy with the ESRI forecasting an end to recession by midyear and a return to modest growth by year-end. However necessarily economic forecasts are based on a range of assumptions about future developments. The ESRI is assuming that the international economic recovery, which has seen all major economies emerge from recession, will be sustained. But it acknowledges that some doubt and uncertainty remain about the underlying strength of the global economy. In reviewing the Budget, the ESRI finds relatively little to criticise. That is scarcely surprising as the Government broadly followed the institute s advice; in particular, by adjusting the imbalance in the public finances through spending cuts rather than tax rises. It does take issue with some Government decisions, such as exclusion of all pensions from any reductions regardless of the wealth of the individuals concerned , which is questionable on the grounds of equity. And it is critical of the car scrappage scheme, arguing that it may simply lead to a substitution in spending as opposed to generating new spending . The ESRI again raises the issue of competitiveness and questions whether enough is being done in order to exploit fully the anticipated economic upturn in 2011. As euro membership means devaluation is no longer possible, it suggests that Ireland needs to generate an internal devaluation through falling prices and wages. There is some evidence this is happening. Prices have fallen faster here in 2009 than in the rest of the euro-zone and the UK and they are expected to do so again next year. Against this the ESRI, in its quarterly report, takes the view that the anticipated 5 per cent fall in wages has failed to materialise. However, the institute signalled that there might be grounds for more optimism in this regard based on wages data published by the CSO yesterday. It is be hoped this optimism proves grounded for without wage reductions, the ESRI warns competitiveness gains will not be realised and the prospects for economic recovery will be significantly weakened.",1,monetary,global crisis,,,,global
140,The Irish Times,02/01/2004,Better outlook for the economy,"There are grounds for guarded optimism about the economic outlook for this year. The economy has survived a difficult period remarkably well, with the jobs market proving particularly resilient. The Exchequer finances are in reasonably good health, debt levels are low and Government spending is back under control after the period of excess in the run up to the last election. Internationally, growth has recovered in recent months and there are signs - albeit still tentative - that this is benefiting the Irish economy. Most forecasters expect a modest pick-up in growth this year, even if the economy will continue to operate somewhere below its full potential. There is thus a good chance that economic recovery will gain momentum as the year goes on, as exporters benefit from a better global environment. Recent indicators show that export orders have already recovered markedly. Meanwhile IDA Ireland is hopeful that a few significant investment projects are on the horizon. While there was a net loss of jobs in manufacturing last year, the decision of industry leaders such as eBay and Google to locate significant operations here gives some cause for optimism for the future. 04010200083 There are, of course, reasons for caution and a risk that the recovery may not be as smooth as most forecasters now anticipate. This is because there are still dangers and uncertainties about the international recovery. And because it is not clear how competitive the Irish economy can be in a much more challenging environment in the future. The international risks are well-rehearsed . They principally centre on the danger that the recovery will be derailed, with a collapse of the US dollar the most likely catalyst. The US currency made heavy losses last year, mainly due to nervousness about the huge deficit on the current account of the US balance of payments. Any further decline this year would put pressure on exporters in Europe - and elsewhere - and could threaten recovery outside the US. A sustained US recovery may lessen nervousness about the dollar and lend it some badly needed support. Much will also depend on political events in the US, with the presidential election in November and continued tension in areas of trade policy. While the US is already growing at a healthy rate, the same cannot be said for the other main economies. There are some signs of a pick-up in the euro zone, but so far they are fairly tentative. EU growth is likely to pick up next year, but the extent of the recovery remains unclear. Against this backdrop, it is important that the European Central Bank stands ready to cut interest rates again, if a further decline of the US dollar poses a significant threat to the growth outlook. It had appeared that EU interest rates had reached their floor, but given the tentative state of the recovery, another cut may be justified early this year. Elsewhere the main EU economies are faced with having to pursue politically difficult reform agendas, while the future of the Stability and Growth Pact - the rules governing budget policy in the euro area - remains in doubt. For the Irish economy, the context is thus a recovering international economy, albeit with some risks and difficulties. There are signals that improving overseas markets are already starting to benefit our economy. Growth has recovered, the live register has fallen in recent months and confidence indicators for business and consumers have improved. Provided the international recovery is sustained, the economy should continue to recover through 2004 and forecasters believe that by 2005 the economy could be back to its potential growth rate of 4 - 5 per cent. The economy has survived the international slowdown remarkably well and so it should benefit as conditions improve. But some questions remain, mainly about the competitiveness. Inflation here has been above the EU average for some years now and recent estimates indicate that Ireland has joined Finland at the top of the European cost-of-living league. Ireland is an increasingly expensive place to do business and our competitiveness is also hindered by the poor state of our infrastructure. These factors are put into sharp focus by the expansion of the EU this year, which will greatly increase the competition for mobile investment projects and by the increasing share of foreign direct investment being won by economies such as China and India. The question for Ireland is how to position ourselves in this rapidly changing global economy. Progress has been made. The rate of inflation is falling, there are signs of acceleration in the programme of infrastructure building and extra funding is being provided for research and development activities and for funding top level science programmes. However it is not yet clear that the Government and its agencies are working to one common agenda and with a clear and determined focus. Progress from now on will be hard won and will require action across a range of policy areas as diverse as competition policy, the efficient delivery of public services and the management of major investment programmes. Ireland has had a remarkable period of economic success. However we face a formidable challenge in holding on to - and building on - the successes of the Tiger era and implementing policies which will continue to allow the economy to outperform.",1,trade,future prospects,,,,ireland
141,The Irish Times,11/10/2017,Betting on growth to pay the bills; Budget 2018,"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe were always going to put their own stamp on their first budget. The shape of the spending and tax package clearly reflects some change in priorities, if not a new direction. As seems inevitable in the current political set-up, the negotiations between the various parties needed to vote the budget through have led to a patchwork of measures to try to keep everyone on board, as well as answering the political priorities of the day. The Government has made a virtue of the necessity of abiding by EU budget rules, pointing out that the books are ""broadly balanced"" for the first time since the crisis. This is welcome, though with national debt in excess of EUR 200 billion and an uncertain outlook due to Brexit, any other course would have been foolish.  Indeed, there is little enough leeway in our finances if there is any downturn in growth in the next few years.  The budget was cleverly constructed from a political point of view, raising revenue largely from the business sector and tobacco and using it to increase spending and reduce taxes on income. Inevitably, given the narrow scope for movement, the changes were modest and the cash boost to the public via tax and welfare changes, however welcome, will be limited.  On the spending side of the equation, Donohoe allocated more to health, policing and education, including the creation of significant numbers of new jobs. There is a real imperative here on delivery. More money needs to mean better services in an era when there simply will not be the resources to throw money at problems, nor should there be. The Government is correct to target investment in areas such as housing and infrastructure, where spending was cut savagely during the big recession. However, it is essential that this spending is driven by economic and social priorities. We are told that major projects are planned for the years ahead, but comprehensive cost-benefit plans are needed to make the case. The need to invest more raises another question. How will this be funded in future? And how should we plan in the context of the uncertainty of Brexit and other external threats?  While there was a welcome promise to create a new ""rainy day"" fund, the budget could have done more to present a coherent picture. Instead, we are keeping our fingers crossed that growth will pay some of the bills in the years ahead. It is a stretch to accuse the Minister of a return to ""boom and bust"" politics, as some within the Opposition did. The Government, correctly, has prioritised meeting EU budget targets next year and is promising to put more cash aside in future. But it is important to remember that we are still relying on growth of 3 per cent plus in the next few years and this cannot be guaranteed.",1,fiscal,budget,,,,ireland
142,The Irish Times,09/11/2015,Beware unusually high tax receipts; Public finances,"The latest Exchequer returns provide both reason to cheer and cause for the Government to worry. Tax revenue for October was boosted by a strong rise of EUR 803 million in corporation tax receipts. It means that after 10 months, corporate taxes are EUR 2 billion above the Department of Finance's target. The Government will be relieved the budget deficit is likely to be less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by year-end and the public finances strengthened before a general election. However, it should become increasingly concerned about the department's huge underestimation of corporate tax receipts - a recurrence of an old forecasting failure.  Between 2004 and 2006, as the economic boom accelerated, the department greatly underestimated tax revenue. Then, as the economic downturn began in 2007 and 2008, it overestimated tax receipts. A major mistake made by government during the boom was to base spending increases on temporary tax revenues collected from an inflated property market that was fast reaching bubble proportions. As the economic recovery accelerates, is the Government in danger of repeating past errors of its predecessor by again over-relying on a transitory revenue source - this time buoyant corporate tax receipts - to finance higher spending that may also prove to be unsustainable? The Government has been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the surge in corporation tax payments last month reflected strong trading conditions rather than exceptional one-off factors. And the increase may well reflect a major US multinational booking more of its profits in Ireland rather than offshore.  Before last month's budget the uniform external advice to Government from various agencies was to frame a cautious budget and not to favour a pro-cyclical fiscal policy for an economy already growing rapidly. However, it chose to disregard that advice and plans to boost spending by an additional EUR 1.5 billion before year-end. This will make it easier to stay within the required 2 per cent benchmark for spending growth in 2016.  However there are signals that the Troika, who visit Ireland this week, will raise questions about this spending strategy. While the Troika itself has little influence on Irish affairs any more, one of its members - the EU Commission - has a formal role in monitoring our budget and its comments will be closely watched. Outgoing Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan, in a pre-budget letter to the Minister for Finance, warned of ""the danger of using windfall fiscal gains to justify long-lasting spending commitments"". Given the uncertainty surrounding the OECD's proposals for new tax rules for multinations and how they may affect Ireland's low corporate tax rate, the dramatic rise in tax receipts may prove temporary and cannot serve as the basis for ""long-lasting spending commitments"".",0,,,,,,
143,Irish Independent,29/10/2010,Bid to calm bond markets with final roll of the dice,"THERE is a scene in the Bond movie 'Goldfinger' where 007 is about to be sawn in half by a giant laser.  ""You expect me to talk'"" he asks Goldfinger.  ""No, Mr Bond"", comes the reply. ""I expect you to die.""  When it comes to the bond markets (no pun intended) Agents Cowen and Lenihan must know how 007 felt. What do those guys want?  Even as they laid their political lives on the table with the extraordinary plan to slash EUR15bn -- one tenth of national income -- off the Budget deficit in the next four years, the bond market turned up the laser.  This is the market where the loans borrowed by governments are traded.  It therefore gives a guide to what a government would have to pay to raise a new loan.  Yesterday, the rate on Irish 10-year debt reached 7pc. Given that prices are actually falling here, that is a penal ""real"" rate of almost 9pc.  The obvious conclusion is that the EUR15bn plan has failed, before it even started.  Its main goal was to turn market sentiment, so that the Government can do next year's borrowing at affordable rates. Paying 7pc is not affordable.  There is still a while to go. The Government, in the shape of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), does not need to borrow money until early next year. But attitudes will need to change before then. They still might, but it looks an uphill task.  It is not all about the EUR15bn. It has been a bad week in general for the ""peripheral"" countries of the euro area -- Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. The original Greek deficit was confirmed at 15pc of GDP. At the start of the crisis, the official figure said 3pc.  Perhaps of more significance were the political troubles of the minority government in Portugal, where budget talks with the main opposition party ended in failure.  The opposition socialists have enough votes to defeat the government, but say they will wait until the budget debate next week before deciding how to vote.  Lenders do not like that kind of uncertainty. But again, what matter is the state of play when the government -- whoever is in it -- comes looking for fresh loans. In this context, the idea of an early Irish Budget cannot be ruled out.  The current strategy is to publish a detailed four-year plan in the next two weeks; to be followed by implementation of the first year's measures in a Budget on December 7.  The whole idea causes deep revulsion among officials and politicians.  Finance officials do not like the constraints on policy which such a method imposes -- even though something like it is the norm in Britain and many other EU states.  Politicians quail at the pressure they will come under to soften the blows during the four-week gap -- and then during the four-year marathon correction which follows.  Publishing the plan and having the Budget on the same day at least avoids the four-week lobbyfest.  It would also allow the markets to see that the measures had actually been passed in the Budget. (Or not, if that turned out to be the case).  Political uncertainty is part of the mix. Not surprisingly, the attempt at political consensus did not get very far. But the tone of this week's Dail debate was quite different from previous outings.  Both Fine Gael and Labour were talking like people who might be taking the actual decisions before too long.  Anyone lending to the Irish Government will be aware that a different government will probably be the one to pay him back. Will it take the same view on paying back the full amount, whatever the cost' Or might it be tempted to ask him to wait longer than agreed for repayment -- or even to take a loss?  The clearer everyone can be on these issues, the better for borrowing costs. But behind political uncertainties, and ""contagion"" from the other peripherals, lie the great rocks of the economic recession and the banking crisis.  The Government's last throw of the dice is to produce a 2011 deficit in single figures -- less than 10pc of GDP. A EUR4.5bn correction, combined with a modest forecast of a 2pc rise in GDP, should do it. If it also passed in the Dail, it might just shift sentiment sufficiently.  Strangely enough, that was the view expressed yesterday, not by a government minister, but by Michael Noonan TD, the Fine Gael finance spokesman. Markets may begin to notice that there is more agreement on strategy between the parties than a first glance would suggest.  If they are not convinced, there is little doubt about what will happen some time next year -- a trip to the new EU rescue fund and the IMF for cheaper loans at 5pc.  Too much fuss can be made about that. In most cases, the austerity programme is imposed after a country seeks such assistance, and the resulting shock is associated with the outside body. In our case, the programme is already inplace, and it seems unlikely that more than EUR15bn would be demanded.  The detail of the cuts and tax rises might change -- but quite possibly for the better. Governments can do things under external instruction that they could not get away with on their own.  A bigger worry is that Europe might use the occasion to swat the hated Irish corporation tax and spancil the financial services centre.  Looked at that way, the bond market may be our friend.  bkeenan@independent.ie",0,,,,,,
144,The Irish Times,18/11/2010,Biffo tells gasping Dáil there's no such thing as a bailout,"DÁIL SKETCH:Taoiseach insists Bailout Boys from abroad are merely dropping by for some engagement  THE EMU has landed. It s all about the euro, stupid. It s why the Men in Suits are arriving here today to run the rule over our books. Not a bailout, so? No such thing, bristles Biffo. That s what he told a gasping Dáil and two senior officials from the British embassy in the distinguished visitors gallery who were taking notes with alarming speed. Nor are there any negotiations going on with the Bailout Boys. It s just technical stuff, insisted the Taoiseach, as his own backbenchers scrunched up their faces in despair. Anyway, it s the fault of the markets for creating this difficult situation for the euro, and unfortunate that when a big economic squeeze is imminent the markets go in search of the choicest lemons. No wonder our leaders looked so haunted yesterday. They are now contriving to feel very hard done by. Throughout the day, in Leinster House and on the airwaves, our governing lemons, from the Taoiseach down, put out the message that their handling of the economy had been nothing short of impeccable since they banjaxed it. If Brian Cowen s performance in the Dáil was jaw-dropping for its bloody-minded insistence that the Bailout Boys are merely dropping by for some engagement and to conduct a routine check-up, Frank Fahey delivered a tour de force on radio. The Taoiseach s loyal lieutenant was in such an upbeat state of sunny denial we feared he might be removed to hospital to have the party line surgically removed from his toes. Speaking on Newstalk s Breakfast Show, Frank began: Well. I think we re in a pretty good position . . . the Government have handled this situation well in that we now have the various players coming to Ireland tomorrow to look at the structure of our banking situation . . .  When the Government asks, the players jump. Fahey stressed that Ireland would play its part in ensuring the continuing strength of the euro . . . This is a euro issue.  Or a ransom note. Fianna Fáil s Frank couldn t speak highly enough of the lemons. For the last 2½ years Brian Cowen and Brian Lenihan have taken all the right actions . . . We ve done all the right things.  Off microphone, a guest seemed to be hyperventilating. Fine Gael s Brian Hayes. Mad as hell. It s a pile of shit, Frank, he snorted, and you don t believe it. All over the country, people drew closer to their radios and cheered. The Greens went missing. Dan Boyle issued a plaintive tweet about trust and uncertainty. Nobody paid much attention. Back in the Dáil, Biffo was getting very frustrated with the Opposition and their questioning of his non-bailout/non-negotiating mantra. And we harked back to happier days when we had no such thing as a recession either. It took months and months for the Taoiseach to utter the R word. He s at it now with the B word. Cabinet members drifted away Hanafin, Martin among them until the faithful four remained: Cowen, Coughlan, Dempsey and Ahern. Éamon Ó Cuív departed, in deep negotiations with Jackie Healy-Rae. Pat Rabbitte exited the chamber in disgust. This is calamitous. I can t listen anymore. The banks are going to cannibalise the country.  Have faith (even if some Fianna Fáil backbenchers, privately, have lost it). For if all goes to plan, those Europeans in denial will take their courage in both hands and allow plucky Ireland rescue their single currency. Whether or not Gunther and Gaston like it, we will force Brussels to bow to our demands for financial assistance . They may resist, but the money is there and by God we will force them to make us take it. We will emerge as heroes when Europe capitulates. Brian has a cunning plan. Mess with the big boys at your peril, eurocrats. The Taoiseach played minor hurling for Offaly. Meanwhile, the Minister for Finance was in Brussels seeking to spare his Government s blushes at this difficult time. It was encouraging to hear him concentrating on the good news (and buttering up the Brits, who are keen to give us a dig-out).  The engagement now takes place, declared Lenihan. Yes indeed, wonderful news from Buckingham Palace. All the best to William and Kate in their forthcoming nuptials. They were so right to delay their marriage plans: housing is much more affordable for young couples now. The Government plans to give them Louth as a wedding present. Just to spite Gerry Adams. And it ll please the IMF too.",0,,,,,,
145,The Irish Times,25/08/2020,Big challenges ahead; Irish economy,"It is increasingly clear that the economic damage from the pandemic will be deep and lasting. The rise in cases of the virus as economies reopen across Europe has necessitated new restrictions and led to concern about what is to come. Governments are trying to balance fresh restrictions with the need to avoid further widespread lockdowns, but this is not easy. Trying to protect both lives and livelihoods, as Taoiseach Micheál Martin put it, is challenging.  A series of reports from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation over the weekend highlights the growing challenges in many sectors. Tourism is the worst hit, with a threat to 200,000 jobs and a likely loss to the economy of EUR 2.3 billion. Many other sectors are also affected - some, like aviation, very severely. In all cases the forecasts are surrounded with huge uncertainty. Fortunately, many other sectors remain healthier and in a recent report credit rating agency Moody's underlined the strengths of the economy. But, the damage is spreading and the longer the pandemic continues, the greater will be the impact on consumer and business confidence. The twin challenge facing the Government is to try to help the worst-hit sectors while also doing what it can to limit the wider damage. Measures such as the extension of wage subsidies to next spring and the extension of the pandemic unemployment payment were correct. But further policy challenges lie ahead and will be framed by the path of the virus. Like their counterparts worldwide, the Government faces the tricky task of adapting supports to the possibility that there will no effective vaccine available for a prolonged period, while holding to the hope that there might be. It is difficult, now, to be prescriptive, on the policy approach given the many uncertainties about the path of the virus and its impact. Fortunately, borrowing markets remain friendly and money can be raised at a very low cost. More supports may be needed, particularly for the worst-hit sectors. But there are limits - and the budget deficit for this year is already likely to top 10 per cent of GDP or EUR 30 billion in cash terms. ",1,disaster,covid,,,,ireland
146,The Irish Times,16/06/2020,Bigger role for State but who will pay for it?; Programme for government leaves much still to play for,"The economics of the programme for government are driven by the extraordinary uncertainty thrown up by the coronavirus crisis. It is full of policy commitments, though most are general and few are tied down in numbers. And it is light on detail regarding how the bigger role for the State envisaged in the programme will be paid for in the years ahead.  The programme sets priorities and new directions, but if it is approved there will be a lot still to play for when the new government takes office. The path of the coronavirus crisis will frame these decisions - and who knows where we will be by the autumn? By necessity, this is more a policy platform than a fully-developed and costed plan. The latter will come in October with a publication of a national economic plan alongside the budget.  In the short term, the focus will be on an economic rescue programme after the coronavirus hit. A promised economic stimulus to be launched next month can be funded with higher borrowing. But in time the next administration will have to work out how to pay for its longer-term plans and more expansive State services. The programme does not spell these out in detail - there are no commitments in terms of numbers of healthcare staff, waiting lists, pupil-teacher ratios and so on. But the direction of travel is clear. New revenue While the document  commits to moving the budget back towards a ""broadly"" balanced position over the term of the next government, using new taxes and spending cuts if needed, there is little detail on where new revenue might be raised. When recovery starts to set in, there will first be a goal of eliminating borrowing to cover day-to-day spending. When incomes start to rise, the government hopes to have enough cash to index the income tax system to ensure people don't automatically get caught with a higher tax burden when pay rises. This indexation didn't happen in the outgoing government, so we will have to wait and see. The first big move of the next government will a""July stimulus"" of the economy , aiming to get economic growth going by boosting investment, focusing on some key infrastructure projects, supporting business investment and a retraining programme. This stimulus route is the economically recommended strategy after the huge Covid-19 hit. The path of the virus will be crucial in determining its success. A wider economic review is then to get under way, under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, as well as forums on various key sectors, while legislation is passed to get promised business supports up and running. There is a commitment to consider additional measures to help the worst-hit sectors, such as tourism, hospitality and entertainment, but a recognition that money will need to go where recovery looks possible. Tensions lie ahead here in deciding which sectors get help - and which don't. National economic plan  The heavy lifting is to come in a new national economic plan which will be published alongside the budget in October and will set the course for the government. This will outline how the public finances are expected to evolve. Much will depend on the path of the Covid-19 virus in the meantime - the next government could be seeing a recovery under way by the autumn, or more uncertainty. In terms of investment spending, one of the few detailed commitments is the retrofitting of 500,000 homes, a costly exercise where households will be offered some financial package to help.A review of the national investment programme will likely mean some projects are long-fingered as others in areas such as public transport, energy and housing get priority.  Tough calls will come in trying to work out how to pay for higher current spending - the recurring annual bills - in areas such as health, childcare and education. Some key decisions are kicked into commissions and committees, including one to look at the pension age issue and another to examine the future of tax and welfare policy. At some stage the calls will have to be made. Apart from the carbon tax, the document says other taxes which would be looked at to reduce the deficit are those designed to change behaviour - such as a sugar tax or one on plastics. These won't produce much cash. There will be controversy over the carbon tax plan and tougher decisions and rows ahead on how to pay for the agenda set out in the programme. Still, as they seek approval from their parliamentary parties, the leaders will reckon that these are rows for another day.",1,disaster,,,,,ireland
147,The Irish Times,03/07/2008,Bleak outlook for a political summer of love,"DÁIL SKETCHEamon Gilmore has crushed the Taoiseach's hopes for a meaningful relationship, writes Michael O'Regan IN HIS early days as Taoiseach, Brian Cowen had positive words to say to Labour while dismissing Fine Gael with a metaphorical wave of the hand. It was seen as an investment in a putative political love-in, which might, if needed, yield an FF-Labour alliance in the fullness of time. It has all ended in tears, with Labour leader Eamon Gilmore repudiating the Taoiseach's political advances in no uncertain terms. Yesterday, wearing a thunderous expression, Gilmore again accused Cowen of being responsible for the economic downturn. Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern, with the air of a man who never uttered a politically partisan word in his career, accused Gilmore of attempting to turn the economic situation to his own political advantage. ""From the best of times, the Government has worked the country and the public finances back into the red,"" said Gilmore, ignoring the Minister. ""If I had been on the benches opposite for 11 years, like the present Government, I would not turn around, pathetically, to ask the Opposition if it has any ideas that can dig it out of the hole."" The Taoiseach replied: ""I stand over my own record."" There was a good turnout of Cowen's backbenchers, but many had little enthusiasm for heckling the Opposition. Some wore glum expressions, knowing that they leave for their constituencies today with the reality of the exchequer returns ringing in their ears. Fine Gael was pleased to see the Labour repudiation of the Taoiseach's advances of such a relatively short time ago when he was in the glow of a brief honeymoon. The Mullingar accord might be dead, but Gilmore clearly feels that the idea of Fianna Fáil overtures, with the country sinking, beats Banagher. ""Hear, hear,"" said Fine Gael's Brian Hayes, as Gilmore pursued Cowen. Lucinda Creighton added her ""hear, hear"". Glaring in the Taoiseach's direction, Gilmore exclaimed: ""He is full of bluster. Bluster will not get him out of this."" Conceding that he was ""not a millions person"", Gilmore warned if services promised in the disability area failed to materialise, he would be asking the Taoiseach about them morning after morning. ""Hear, hear,"" Brian Hayes repeated. Cowen claimed that the Government had created 600,000 jobs in the past 10 years. ""Business created those jobs,"" snapped Gilmore. Cowen said that Gilmore had ""a different comfort zone"" to deal with, but he would handle his job as Taoiseach as he saw fit. The putative political romance is over, with no hope of a reconciliation this side of a general election. The Taoiseach has retreated to the bosom of his current Coalition family, the PDs, Greens and Independents, his pockets near empty, and the largesse of his days in the Department of Finance a distant memory. I wonder is Bertie Ahern glad to be away from it all?",0,,,,,,
148,Irish Independent,27/07/2011,Blow to recovery hopes as slowdown hits UK economy,"economy  THE economy in Ireland's largest trading partner barely grew between April and June and industrial output shrank, stoking doubt about the prospects for recovery in both Ireland and the UK.  Gross domestic product grew by 0.2pc in Britain in the second quarter from the first, which took the annual growth rate to 0.7pc, the lowest since the first quarter of 2010, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday.  Economists had expected growth of 0.2pc after the economy flatlined over the six previous months.  Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale told Germany's 'Handelsblatt' newspaper there was a real danger the economy could shrink again.  No country matters more to the Irish economy. The UK is Ireland's largest export market, taking 16pc of everything sent abroad, while Ireland is the UK's fifth largest export market. Any slowdown in our largest export market will have a knock-on effect on growth here.  The Central Bank is due to publish new growth forecasts for this year and next on Friday, with some economists such as Bloxham's Alan Quaid predicting the bank will cut predictions for growth.  In the UK, economists blamed some of the slow growth on the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton which triggered a public holiday. The statistics office said special factors such as an additional holiday for the royal wedding and the after-effects of the tsunami in Japan subtracted up to 0.5 percentage points of quarterly growth in the second quarter.  ""If you consider that the bank holiday for the royal wedding probably subtracted a quarter per cent or so from growth, the numbers aren't that far from being respectable,"" said Investec economist Philip Shaw. ""However, looking forward there are a number of headwinds to growth and the policy outlook remains very uncertain.""  Other unusual factors affecting GDP were the £300m spent on tickets for the Olympic Games and warm weather in April, which encouraged people to take holidays locally and stay in hotels.  The sluggish economy is a serious headache for David Cameron's government which is already under pressure over politicians' ties to Rupert Murdoch's media empire in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. Still, the government left little doubt it would stick to its deficit reduction plan. Finance minister George Osborne said the economy was stable thanks to the government's commitment.  ""Abandoning that now, as some argue we should, would only risk British jobs and growth,"" he said in a statement after the GDP data release.  The statistics office said output fell 1.4pc on the quarter, while the service sector expanded by 0.5pc, driven by growth in transport, communications and business services.

149,The Irish Times,29/05/2021,"BMW boss charged up by excess pandemic savings; Pandemic and switch to electric cars driving change at BMW Ireland, says Kevin Davidson","The motor trade has reopened its glass palaces amid a revolution, not just in the cars it sells, but how they're sold. The shift to electric vehicles is upending automakers, but it's the rapid adoption of online sales and over-the-air vehicle updates that will disrupt the way cars are sold, serviced and even owned.  The Irish motor trade has coped surprisingly well with the pandemic. While the first lockdown saw new car sales initially collapse, the situation improved in the autumn with total sales for 2020 down 24.6 per cent on 2019. The market to the end of March was down just 3.5 per cent on last year (before lockdown struck) and 25 per cent on the first quarter of 2019.  Compared to other consumer sectors, the motor trade has survived the pandemic with only minor damage.  As the economy unlocks, many in the industry are now eyeing the so-called excess pandemic savings of consumers, estimated in a March economic letter by the Central Bank of Ireland to be about EUR 10 billion.  BMW Ireland's Scottish-born managing director Kevin Davidson sees the potential for the brand to tap into that post-pandemic savings pot.  ""Clearly in Ireland there are some sectors that have been very badly hit economically by Covid. But if you look at where a lot of our customer base is - they're probably working in financial services or technology, pharmaceuticals - they've been booming."" Davidson is full of praise for the way his dealers and their 600 staff adapted to the new, increasingly online, environment.  ""What has impressed me is the speed of adaptation. And I think what helps them, as much as what helped us as BMW Ireland, was that working digitally forces you to think more digitally. It's bizarre in a way, if you're in that space, things become clearer. And you're able to develop digital tools much quicker."" It begs the question as to whether too much investment and effort has been spent on the glass palace showrooms that adorn the outskirts of Irish towns rather than online solutions. After all, some 55,207 new cars were sold up to the end of April this year, all theoretically traded remotely without the need for shiny showrooms. ""There's no doubt probably, going back maybe five to 10 years, we probably did overcook the physical investment. But that was all about the brand standards, it was done for good reason at the time. I think things have moved on,"" he says. ""Clearly, with the growth of digital, I think, probably the investment in physical facilities will be less, [but] I don't think it will be nothing.""  Davidson says customers will still want to go for a test drive and will need to have their cars serviced or repaired in a workshop.  ""Okay, in the future, when all cars are electric, are cars going to be needing to be serviced? Well, possibly not. But they'll need tyres and they'll need other replacement parts. ""You might have things like large used car centres and handover centres, so you might have fewer retailers, but you might have bigger used car supermarkets. If you look at what a lot of the big dealer groups are doing, they've developed their used car markets.""  Davidson points to a pilot scheme BMW is operating in South Africa, ""where basically [the car maker] does the transaction with the customer - it's an online sale. The retailer gets a handling fee based on doing the test drive and handover. And it's going quite well.  ""But I still think there a long way to go before we would say that's a model you would roll out across the rest of the world."" So will the current dealer franchise model survive into the next decade? ""The customer may dictate that. Today, the retailer still is the one who has a relationship with the customer."" As a further reassurance to dealers that the end is not near just yet, Davidson explains that today's cars tend to stay on the road for up to 20 years. So, even if the manufacturers don't produce any more new petrol and diesel models from 2040, that still means there will be vehicles on the road requiring traditional servicing and maintenance, probably up to 2060. However, in the interim, another feature of the motoring world may change: the nature of car ownership. Many car companies predict vehicles will be provided via subscription services rather than ownership within the next decade. Several already operate pilot schemes across Europe.  Davidson says that still seems some way off for Ireland, with buyers preferring the traditional ownership model right now. ""But I think that will change, particularly as the younger generation seems to not really care about ownership; they're probably fine with usership. ""We will see a subscription model in the future. If you think about it, because of remote vehicle diagnosis, there is the ability to turn [features or options] on and off. So technological options on cars can be bought online temporarily, which lends itself to a subscription model.  ""But I think you have to step carefully through that. You have to try it with the consumer to see if it works. It's what is working in other industries, why not automotive?"" he says. Back to the present and Davidson reckons the Government has coped well with the pandemic. ""I would applaud the Government for the way they've managed the lockdown. I think they've done that pretty well."" However, he doesn't believe it is doing a good job managing the transition to electric vehicles.   Electric vehicles According to Davidson, the commitment to having one million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 requires a solid partnership between  car manufacturers and Government. The car companies are backing the move with billions of euro in investment, but the Government needs to create a roadmap to support the transition.  Uncertainty over changes to taxes and grants are very unwelcome amid this move to electric.  He was particularly irked by the announcement of cuts to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grants for plug-in hybrid electric cars from EUR 5,000 to EUR 2,500 and a cap on grants to all-electric cars priced over EUR 60,000. Both are set to come into play from July 1st.  ""I was very disappointed in that. I actually thought the model that we had in Ireland, the incentives that we had in place, were brilliant. They were encouraging people to move from internal combustion engine cars to electric cars. ""I accept all the arguments asking why should people get such a big grant if they are buying such an expensive car. I can get that, but we've got quite a big job to do. The Government have said that they want a million electric vehicles by 2030. But then at the same time, they've cut the grants. I would ask the Government, is that not a mixed message?"" Davidson has also been critical of the recent changes to Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), which hit larger diesel engines in particular.  He wrote to Taoiseach Micheál Martin before last autumn's budget calling for the Government not to follow the proposals of the Tax Strategy Group when it came to adjusting the tax bands on diesel and petrol cars. Davidson told the Taoiseach that replacing older, more polluting cars with plug-in hybrids and fully-electric alternatives would be ideal, but some consumers will still want to replace these cars with cleaner petrol and diesel engines in the interim.  Despite these calls by the industry, the Tax Strategy Group recommendations were largely adopted in Budget 2021.   Targets Davidson accepts that Europe's politicians and their advisers probably have got electric car targets right. When EU governments talked about bans on non-electric car and van sales from 2030, auto makers initially said 2040 was the earliest realistic target date. Now several major brands are on track to meet the earlier 2030 target, at least for Europe. ""The Irish Government targets set around 2030 are ambitious,"" says Davidson. ""The BMW Group is in a very good position to respect these targets. The most important basic requirement for the breakthrough will be expansion of public and private charging infrastructure across Ireland.""  BMW says about 90 per cent of its market categories will have fully-electric models available by 2023. A decade ago BMW seemed to have a lead over established premium rivals in terms of electric cars, with innovative models such as the i3 and i8. Then its new electric vehicle pipeline seemed to stall. Right now, the brand seems more of a follower in the all-electric market.  ""I think it's a fair critique. Maybe the company wasn't 100 per cent clear on the direction,"" he says. ""But that's changed. I listened to a broadcast the other day from some board members. And what they said was the greenest electric car on the planet will come from BMW.""  He also notes the high number of plug-in electric hybrids (PHEVs) in the current BMW fleet. ""We were probably quicker out of the blocks with PHEVs. If you look at our mix, 38 per cent of sales this year is PHEV or [full electric], which is way higher than our direct competitors. So we probably have been more in that space. I don't think we've been doing nothing. I think we probably focused on the middle ground. ""And the next three new cars we're launching are all-electric cars. That's really exciting. Since the BMW i3 and i8, we have increased the number of electrified vehicles (pure electric and plug-in hybrid) in our line-up to 13 models.  ""Two key innovation flagships will be on the road this year: the BMW iX and the BMW i4. The BMW i4 will even be released three months earlier than originally planned."" Davidson's arrival in Ireland followed a restructuring of local operations. Employee numbers at the head office in Dublin have been cut from 25 to 11, although six UK-based staff are now working on the Irish operation as well.  ""We had too many heads [employees] for the volume that we are delivering,"" he explains. ""I think we could go back to 25 heads, but we need to be selling 8,000 to 10,000 cars."" In 2019, BMW Ireland sold just over 4,500 new cars. The German carmaker had taken direct control of its Irish operations in 2003, with the division here leaning heavily on its UK counterpart for support. Is it still worthwhile operating a wholly-owned company here rather than appointing a local distributor?  ""I think there are huge advantages from being in the market, but the market has to be the right size. I think so long as [the new car market] is over 100,000, you'd have a national sales company,"" he says.  Like many businesses, Davidson reckons remote working in some form is here to stay. BMW Ireland is moving to a smaller office space in the same building and Davidson will be commuting from the UK where his family lives. Due to the rules on self-isolation after travel, he currently spends five weeks in Ireland and five weeks in the UK office, but he foresees operating on a two-week basis - as he did pre-pandemic.  That said, he is also eager to enjoy some normal Irish lifestyle. ""I did come to Ireland for the pubs as well. But due to the pandemic I have been in just three pubs in 15 months."" As we part company, Davidson pulls up a photo on his phone, a picture of himself as a young boy with one of his toy cars in a 1960s sitting-room in Stirling in Scotland, his proud dad standing alongside. An avid collector of Matchbox toy cars, Davidson earned his pocket money on Saturdays working with his father who sold fruit from his vans direct to customers.  It also gave Davidson an insight to the circle of life in consumer markets. His dad's business died on the back of a boom in corner shops. They in turn suffered at the hands of the high-street supermarkets. These then lost out to the out-of-town shopping centres. And now those are under threat from home delivery services, not far removed from the sort of service offered by his father.  While the motor trade is entering a new era, when it comes to customer service, he reckons we shouldn't forget the lessons of the past.  CV  Name: Kevin Davidson.

150,The Irish Times,27/03/2008,BofI reduces forecast for economic growth to 3%,"  BANK OF Ireland has cut its economic growth forecast due to a more severe slowdown in the housing sector but still expects the economy to grow by 3 per cent this year, buoyed by strong exports. Simon Carswell, Finance Correspondent, reports   The bank said in its latest quarterly economic outlook that the economy would grow by 4 per cent next year. It had expected 4 per cent growth this year but has reduced this estimate as it now expects 8,000 fewer new houses to be completed this year. Bank of Ireland chief economist Dan McLaughlin said the housing slowdown would knock 1.3 per cent off Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year as he forecast 50,000 house completions this year, down from 78,000 last year. He is expecting employment growth of 40,000 this year as construction job losses are offset by new jobs in the services sector. Dr McLaughlin's outlook is more upbeat than most other forecasts as he believes the economy will be bolstered by strong exports, particularly in services. He said the economy was experiencing ""a cyclical slowdown"" and that the outlook was ""not great but not the end of the world either"". He added that the economy grew by 5.3 per cent last year, in line with growth between 2001 and 2006. ""We will get 3 per cent growth this year. People say that's a bit optimistic but given that we have come from a period where growth has been around 5.5 per cent it will feel like a weaker economy."" Dr McLaughlin said State spending on infrastructure would only partially offset the housing slowdown, leading to total construction falling by 5.1 per cent this year. He said housebuilding would fall from 9.2 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 7.7 per cent this year, but that the sector would recover next year. The bank expects Irish exports to grow by 5 per cent, compared with a 8.2 per cent rise last year, and consumer spending to increase by 4 per cent this year from 5.4 per cent last year. Earnings would rise 4.7 per cent this year from 5.3 per cent last year. Dr McLaughlin said the ECB would cut rates by 0.5 percentage points to 3.5 per cent by the end of the year due to slower economic growth, despite inflation remaining high. He said the banking crisis added uncertainty to growth but that the US government's $150 billion (EUR 95.48 billion) fiscal package would determine the severity of the downturn. ""The uncertainties lie around how prolonged the credit crunch is, how big an impact that has, and particularly, how the US economy responds to the fiscal and monetary stimulus."" Tax receipts this year would be EUR 1 billion short of the figure projected in the Budget, leaving a EUR 2.8 billion deficit, which, at 1.4 per cent of GDP, was ""in line with the EU average"". The bank's outlook for this year is considerably more optimistic than the recent 1.8 per cent GDP growth forecast from the ESRI.  ",0,,,,,,
151,The Irish Times,31/12/2010,Bonds move into the mainstream as crisis deepens,"Greek drama formed the template for a horrendous year for Irish sovereign debt, writes SUZANNE LYNCH THIS WAS the year when bonds, bond yields and spreads were no longer things that kept investment fund managers awake at night but instead became matters that could make or break countries. Coverage of the bond markets moved into the mainstream media this year, as the euro zone debt crisis became one of the biggest news stories of 2010, culminating in two bailouts by the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), first in Greece and, seven months later, in Ireland. Concerns about the financial health of Greece s economy, which centred on the country s budget deficit, were evident from the beginning of the year and were manifested in rising bond yields and widening spreads between Germany and Greece. In January, the European Commission condemned Greece for falsifying data about its public finances. Later that month, Greece unveiled an ambitious three-year stability programme which pledged to cut its budget deficit from 12.7 per cent in 2009 to 2.8 per cent of GDP in 2012. In an admonitory warning of what was to happen a few months later in Ireland, reassurances from the EU and the IMF failed to stem market scepticism. On April 23rd, Greece formally requested a bailout following a climactic sell-off in Greek debt markets the previous day, during which two-year bond yields reached 11 per cent. A few days later, the Greek debt rating was decreased to the first levels of junk status by Standard Poor s amid fears of default by the Greek government. Yields on Greek government two-year bonds rose to 15.3 per cent following the downgrading, although only a handful of bonds were changing hands at that stage. In early May, a EUR 110 billion package was agreed for Greece by the EU and IMF. Following the Greek bailout, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was put in place, though Europe resisted calls to implement a major bond-buying programme along the lines of the quantitative easing programme adopted by the US. While the bailout removed the need for Greece to borrow for more than two years, yields remain high, again presaging developments in Ireland a few months later. Ironically, in light of what happened towards the end of the year, the Irish sovereign debt market got off to a relatively good start in 2010. The second half of 2009 had been reasonably good for Ireland s sovereign debt: Ireland s funding costs had hit a peak in March 2009 but fell back in the latter half of the year. AS IN 2009, the Government moved early to take advantage of January decisions by fund managers and went into the bond markets during the first half of the month. A series of monthly bond auctions followed, which by September had allowed the State to raise EUR 20 billion to fund itself. Although yields were higher, demand for Irish Government debt was fairly strong in the first half of the year, assuaging concerns about contagion from the Greek emergency. In March, Ireland sold EUR 1.5 billion in bonds at a yield of 4.426 per cent, representing the smallest premium over the equivalent in safer German government bonds since December 2008 and 1.58 per cent below the peak spread in March 2009. Despite the bullish rhetoric from the National Treasury management Agency (NTMA) and the Minister for Finance, Irish sovereign debt, along with the debt of the other so-called Pigs nations Portugal, Greece and Spain was feeling the pressure, with the spread on 10-year Irish bonds remaining more than 3 per cent above the benchmark German in early summer. Things took a turn for the worse as the summer drew to a close. While investor concern had initially focused on Portugal, by September the extra yield investors demanded to hold Irish bonds had surged to record highs because of worries about the State s ability to manage the cost of its bank bailout, fuelled in large part by uncertainty about the final cost of the Anglo bailout. On September 24th, Irish borrowing costs hit a new high of 6.546 per cent, while the spread between 10-year Irish bonds and German bunds rose to a euro lifetime high of 451 basis points. Brian Lenihan said there was a concerted attack on euro zone nations. The European Central Bank was reported to being buying Irish Government debt on the secondary markets in a bid to halt the slide in its price. IN SEPTEMBER, THE NTMA announced it would cancel its remaining bond auctions for the rest of the year. Although the agency pointed out, correctly, that the country was fully funded to the middle of 2011, the decision not to go to the market was a measure of the severity of the debt crisis. What happened next has been well-documented. Irish bond yields continued to rise inexorably throughout October and November as the markets lost confidence in Ireland s ability to meet its debts. London clearing-house LCH Clearnet increased the margin it required on Ireland s bonds and a sense of panic took hold among investors. Despite repeated assurances from the Government that Ireland was in control of its finances, yields on 10-year Government bonds surpassed the psychologically-important barrier of 9 per cent. After weeks of denial by the Irish authorities, on November 18th EU and IMF negotiators arrived in Dublin for talks about a rescue plan for Ireland, which resulted in a EUR 85 billion rescue package. It was announced that under the terms of the bailout, Ireland would be out of the market for three years and would instead draw on the fund as required, subject to a blended interest rate of 5.8 per cent. Since then, as happened with Greece, Irish bond yields failed to fall significantly. At time of writing, yields on 10-year Irish Government debt was 8.87 per cent. Meanwhile, investor concern has switched to the sovereign debts of Spain and Portugal, amid widespread fears of a contagion effect, while a proposal, floated after the Irish bailout, to introduce new so- called euro bonds appears to have lost ground. Despite a horrendous year for Irish sovereign debt issuance, the picture on secondary markets was a lot brighter. Fixed income investments delivered strong performances for investors, while there was heavy turnover in Government bonds, particularly in the first three-quarters of the year. Data from the Irish Stock Exchange show that turnover in Irish Government bonds and treasury bills was up more than 75 per cent in the first nine months of the year, EUR 197 billion, compared with EUR 112 billion in the same period last year. However, the market came under pressure in the last couple of months.  There was a very strong performance in the first three quarters of the year, though this was given back to some extent in the final quarter, said Oliver Mangan, chief bond economist at AIB. Barry Nangle, head of bonds at Davy stockbrokers, said the slowdown in the final quarter was due in part to the fact that new investors were slow in coming to the market, while the widening bid-offer spread meant people were less inclined to deal. Irish bank debt also had a tumultuous year, as the debate about burden-sharing by the holders of Irish bank debt intensified, particularly towards the end of the year. Fergal O Leary of Glas Securities notes that the market was active, with volumes in bank debt seeing broadly similar increases in turnover as Irish Government bonds, which increased in volume by approximately 38 per cent on last year. Irish Banks issued a total of EUR 21.4 billion of Irish Government-guaranteed debt over the course of the year, largely issued in the first five months of the year, O Leary adds. This issuance was in the most part due to the EUR 30 billion of bond maturities in September, which arose as a direct result of bonds previously issued under the September 2008 guarantee.  Nangle also notes that trade in subordinated bank debt was particularly active in the final quarter of the year.  As the price dropped and the status was downgraded, some of the big pension funds and insurance companies became forced sellers, with the result that new buyers, such as hedge funds and high-yield fund managers, came into the market.  IN TERMS OF returns for investors, Irish Government bonds had a poor year. The Iseq bond indices, which measure the return on Irish Government securities, showed a negative return during quarter three, with returns in the range of -2.39 per cent to -7.13 per cent, following returns in the range of -1.8 per cent to -4.8 per cent in the first half of 2010. According to O Leary, 10-year Irish Government bonds had a -19 per cent total return to December 20th, versus 7 per cent in the equivalent maturity in Germany, while Greek 10- year bonds posted a -27.7 per cent return for the same period. However, he points out that in contrast, shorter-dated Irish Government bonds posted a positive return for the year. Despite the poor return from Irish Government bonds, the broader picture for Irish pension funds and investors was positive, due to the fact that only a small amount (less than 5 per cent on average) of most pension funds held Irish sovereign debt. According to the data management provider MoneyMate, Irish gross domestic funds invested in fixed-interest products, including Government and corporate bonds and debt-related securities, returned 2.4 per cent during the year. One of the more interesting developments to watch in 2011 will be a new sovereign annuities scheme, which was announced on December 17th, which will allow Irish investors to increase their holding of Irish Government debt. After that, the question of what will happen to interest rates which is closely involved with the performance of the bond market will be the other main issue to consider next year, with some commentators predicting that interest rates may not increase until 2012.",1,debt,public debts,,,,ireland
152,Irish Independent,02/01/2008,Bookies back Bertie to ride out controversy over dig-outs,"SARAH Delamere Harding had the only good news for Bertie Ahern in this newspaper on New Year's Eve: ""Expect a winning streak to iron out practical issues.''  But then our astrologer added a caveat, warning the Virgo Taoiseach to ""sit back to find out who your friends are"".  Yesterday, a bookie backed up our stargazer's predictions by plumping for 2009 as the year Mr Ahern is most likely step down. And when the bookie in question is a former government minister who now turns political prophecy into a profit, the Taoiseach can afford to relax this week.  Ivan Yates has mapped out the political future and is backing his speculative predictions with hard cash. And in the world according his Celtic Bookmakers, Brian Cowen at odds of 1/6, will replace Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach.  The odds of it happening this year are 7/4 against but in 2009 it is a 1/2 chance.  Micheal Martin at 2/1 will prevail over the 4/1 second favourite, Brian Lenihan, and Dermot Ahern and Mary Hanafin at 6/1, to become Tanaiste.  This year's EU treaty referendum is a 1/8 near certainty for a 'yes' win. Hillary Clinton will be elected President of the United States; the Conservative Party are 4/6 favourites to win the British General Election expected in 2010.  And the year after that, 2011, Bertie Ahern, Dick Spring and John Bruton are neck-and-neck at 4/1 to become succeed Mary McAleese as President, according to Celtic Bookmakers.  Although Leinster House insiders are betting on Mary Harney to be appointed EU Commissioner next year, Yates has Charlie McCreevy at 2/5 favourite and he is laying any other candidate at 9/4 against.  Yates, a shrewd old fox, reckons that Bertie Ahern will address the joint houses in the US in April, after he has finished giving evidence to the Mahon Tribunal.  By that logic, it would be seen as unpatriotic to embarrass the Taoiseach before such a great honour for the country, and, by the summer, the momentum to dump Bertie Ahern would have passed. Bertie Ahern has held Brian Cowen in something of a drowning man's grip through his recent tribunal travails. It is now understood that all major decisions are passed on to the Tanaiste's office for his approval, giving Cowen what amounts to shared authority.  The danger for Cowen is, of course, that the longer he is seen a joint custodian with Ahern, the more he will be tarnished by any public disenchantment with the Taoiseach.  Yates sees the economy as the biggest worry for the Government and the country, with a many as 50,000 job losses creating a tension between the private and public sectors.  And when such an august journal as 'The Economist' is writing editorials headed 'Postcards From The Ledge', it does conjure up nightmares on Merrion Street.  Talk about a credit crunch, a liquidity squeeze, and a subprime meltdown heading toward a banking crisis has been hanging around the Central Bank and Department of Finance like the ghost of Christmas past.  Particularly when, as 'The Economist' points out, the grievous experience of two centuries is that when the banks are in difficulty the mess usually spreads.  Worried banks lend less which sucks more money out of the economy, which, in rich countries like Ireland, makes companies more cautious and further depresses housing markets.  Opportunist merchant bankers will undoubtedly pick over the carcass of the recent credit boom and make money with increasingly inventive schemes.  And it is only when these predatory financiers put their billions back to work in the markets that we will know the corner has been turned.  The Government responded to a message from private sector workers when they postponed their salary increase.  The Cabinet backed down because of the real and deep anger from people nervously looking at the prospect of job losses, while watching the huge pay hikes for senior politicians and public servants.  However, the downturn in the economy will, paradoxically, be a spur for less-confident voters to vote for the Lisbon Treaty.  Enda Kenny's leadership of Fine Gael is unthreatened, meanwhile, as the party's latest TDs gain experience. They will continue to mature should the party fail to be in government after the next election in 2011.  Fine Gael have not been in better shape for more than 30 years and their newly gained confidence was matched only by the Government's fumbling uncertainty through the autumn.  Paddy Power has placed a Fianna Fail merger with the SDLP in Northern Ireland this year at odds of 6/5, and at 10/11 for an official Fianna Fail candidate to run in local and European election in the North next year.  Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, who have often bucked the odds before, must shudder at the even-money prospect of a merger between the SDLP and Fianna Fail.  The tectonic plates of history are shifting and you may wonder for whom the bell is tolling in 2008. ",0,,,,,,
153,The Irish Times,12/11/1992,"Borrow-and-boost plan from Fianna FailThe economic policies in the Fianna Fail manifesto are analysed by Cliff Taylor, Economics Editor","FIANNA Fail has gone to great trouble to dress up its new economic package, but the basis of it is straigthforward. It involves getting the National Treasury M ent Agency to borrow more money which will be used, together with EC funds, to push up state spending on big capital projects in an attempt to give a boost to the economy. The economy could do with such a lift in investment spending, but Fianna Fail does not spell out satisfactorily how it will spend the money and, despite what the party says, the plan will push up state boi'rowing significantly, in the short term at least. At the centre of the Fianna Fail economic plan is a new £750 million jobs fund. Funds fit in with the traditional Fianna Fail desire to be seen to take a ""developmental role"" in the economy, without upsetting anybody. The Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, said yesterday that the programme ""will not involve any increase in borrowing or any increase in taxation"". In fact, if the plan becomes reality, the new jobs fund will push up state borrowing next year, although it will not show up in the annual Budget arithmetic. Under the plan, the National Treasury Management Agency will set up a new holding company to take on the remaining state shareliolding in Greencore and Irish Life and the two state banks, ACC and ICC. On the strength of these assets, the holding company will borrow £370 million on the international markets. The Government. hopes this funding will be matched by £370 million-plus from the next batch of EC funds, providing the magic £750 million. When financial markets improve, the NTMA holding company will sell off the state shareholdings to private investors and recoup its borrowings. Do the numbers add up? At yesterday's stockmarket prices the State's 30 per cent shareholding in Greencore is worth £60 million and its 34 per cent holding in Irish Life is valued at £150 million. The state banks, ICC and ACC, have been on the market for some time and are valued by analysts at around £1OO million. The total market value of the shareholdings of £310 million is £60 million short of the Government figure. This is the Fianna Fail ""hope dividend"" the party hopes financial markets will improve before the share sales go ahead. In the meantime the money borrowed will not appear as exchequer borrowing in..the Budget lculations as it is being raised by the special NTMA holding company - a peculiar arrangement similar to the private-sector concept off-balance-sheet financing. But until the state shareholdings are sold and the money recouped, it is still extra borrowing guaranteed by the State. And it will almost certainly count in terms of the guidelines laid down in the Maastricht Treaty for states wishing to qualify for the final state of monetary union, as the EC rules include all state borrowing and not just that carried oiit by the exchequer. The other uncertainty is that the EC money counted as part of the fund has still to be agreed. Borrowing on the strength of state assets to fund higher exchequer caPital spending in a time of very poor economic growth and high unemployment has some economic justification. With Irish interest rates so high, exchequer capital investment could make up for the likely shortfall in providing investment spending over the next 18 months. But it is of crucial importance that the projects on which the money raised from the once-off sale of state assets is spent offer a genuine long-term return to the economy. But with the National Development Plan for the next phase of EC funds being drawn up in secret, we have only the sparse and unsatisfactory details in the manifesto to go on. There may well be a case for more spending on the national roads, while investment in the main ports may be justified if their management structures are revamped as promised. Other planned projects rest on shakier foundations. Is a national convention centre really a priority? The manifesto promises a new peat- fired power station in the midlands, but this is an investment in an inefficient and environmentally unfriendly way of generating electricity. The party must convince the public and the market that its investment priorities are based on economic rather than political considerations. Already there are dark and cynical whispers that the policy is an attempt by Fianna Fail to by-pass the Department of Finance's tight grip on spending by using the NTMA holding company route. On tax policy the main new proposal, designed to lift the burden off low-paid workers, is to increase the standard-rate tax band to ensure that a single person does not move on to the higher tax rate until earnings exceed £20 000. (The current figure is £10,600). In total, the tax plan, which also involves further cuts in the income-tax rates, might cost £500 million over the lifetime of the government. No indication is given of how these bills arc to be met, although the party says that the reductions will only be introduced as they can be afforded. The Minister for Finance, Mr Ahern, says that any reductions in the 1993 Budget would be ""very, very small"" and would concentrate on helping lower-paid workers. Elsewhere the manifesto contains the usual campaign promises, many of which should be taken with a pinch of salt. For example, the idea of Aer Rianta taking a stake in Aer Lingus does not appear to have any clear logic and may not be unrelated to the battle for the fourth seat in Dublin North. What is clear is that the Fianna Fail manifesto heralds the end of the policy of trying to create the right business environment and letting the private sector do the rest. According to Mr Reynolds: ""We cannot just afford to wait until better international conditions return or to take the view that all any government can do is create the climate and after that our duty is finished.""",0,,,,,,
154,The Irish Times,22/09/2010,Borrowing at a price,"THE SALE yesterday of EUR 1.5 billion of government debt has proved a qualified success. The auction showed there was strong demand for Irish government bonds where two offerings by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) were three and five times over-subscribed. But the price paid to secure those borrowings was expensive as investors sought a substantial risk premium. The 4.78 per cent yield or interest rate on four-year bonds was more than a percentage point higher than lenders received a month ago.   For the Government, any relief at the level of investor interest in the bond offering will be tempered by concern that the State s borrowing costs now stand at a record and unsustainable high. The Government did not need to return to the debt markets yesterday: it has already raised sufficient funds to finance this year s budget and has prefunded a large part of its needs for 2011. However, a decision to withdraw from the regular monthly bond auction would have been ill-advised. It would have added to market uncertainty and adversely affected investor sentiment by bolstering suggestions that Ireland, like Greece, might need to rely on assistance from the euro zone s rescue fund for its borrowing needs. Nevertheless the large risk premium now sought by buyers of Irish sovereign debt is a concern the Government must address with much greater urgency. It reflects investor worries about the ultimate cost of recapitalising the banks and Anglo Irish Bank in particular. It also reflects increased investor doubts expressed by the International Monetary Fund and others that the Government can reduce the budget deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2014, as agreed with the European Union. And it is indicative of investor fears that the global economic recovery, which shows signs of faltering, may be insufficient to boost domestic growth and help stabilise the public finances. Bond markets price risk and, with investors more risk averse and more sceptical in recent months about the Government s ability to meet its medium-term fiscal targets, the result has been a much higher cost of borrowing. Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan, in stating on Monday that some explicit reprogramming of the budgetary profile for the coming years is clearly necessary soon , has indicated that budget savings greater than the promised EUR 3 billion in the 2011 budget will be required to ensure that fiscal targets are met. In that way, he suggests, international lenders can be best reassured that budget discipline will be maintained. The Government has four weeks before the next bond auction. In that time, it needs to provide greater clarity about its intentions in order to regain lost credibility. The Minister for Finance has said the December budget may involve greater savings than the projected EUR 3 billion but he must be more explicit. By the end of this month, the Central Bank will provide an estimate of likely losses on non-Nama loans held by Anglo Irish Bank. And that too should help reassure financial markets.

155,Irish Independent,07/07/2020,"Borrowing necessary but we will be left vulnerable, Central Bank warns","THE boss of the Central Bank will today warn TDs that Ireland's high level of debt leaves the Government's finances ""vulnerable to future shocks"". Governor Gabriel Makhlouf will say that the rise in the deficit as the Government borrows to tackle the coronavirus crisis is ""warranted"", ""necessary"" and ""currently affordable"". But he will tell the Dáil's Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that it does leave the State vulnerable to challenges posed by the implications of Brexit, international tax reform and climate change. The budget deficit is estimated to reach between (EURO)23bn and (EURO)30bn due to borrowing to fund the massive initiatives such as the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, as well as the need to inject resources into the health service. Mr Makhlouf will tell TDs: ""The high level of debt will leave Government finances vulnerable to future shocks and it will be important for the Government to provide a clear and credible return to much lower and sustainable deficit and debt positions."" His statement to the committee also says that households, businesses and the financial system have entered the current crisis in a more resilient position compared to the onset of the financial crisis a decade ago. Mr Makhlouf will say that future policy should ""continue to focus on supporting the productive capacity of the economy and avoiding scarring effects such as long-term unemployment"". He will add: ""Any such action by the Government is likely to be costly in the near term but will benefit the fiscal position over the medium term if it is effective in reducing the degree of damage to the economy's productive capacity."" The Government is currently planning a July jobs initiative stimulus package to be announced later this month. Mr Makhlouf will tell TDs that the Central Bank's primary focus since March had been on ensuring the financial system absorbed the coronavirus shock, supporting households and firms through the crisis and being ready to support the recovery. He says the economic outlook is ""very uncertain"" and ""the path ahead for the economy will depend on the future path of the virus, the degree to which containment measures need to remain in place or be reintroduced, and the immediate and longer-lasting effects on behaviour and economic activity"". Mr Makhlouf will outline two scenarios that have been set out by the Central Bank. The first is an assessment of what would happen if the easing of coronavirus restrictions takes place as planned. Unemployment would fall from a peak of 25pc to around half that by the end of 2020. GDP would be down 9pc but there would be a recovery to pre-crisis levels by 2022. Under the severe scenario, GDP would fall by 13pc this year and not recover until 2024. Neither scenario takes into account a possible no-trade-deal Brexit. Senior National Treasury Management Agency official Frank O'Connor will also appear at the committee. He will tell TDs that the State is ""in a strong position to meet its borrowing requirements"".

156,The Irish Times,31/12/2004,Boston well and truly beat Berlin in the 2004 performance stakes,"Dan McLaughlin looks at how the Celtic Tiger is likely to weather the rough seas of the global economy. Sometimes things turn out broadly as expected, even in the uncertain world of economic activity. Most forecasters had projected a pick-up in global growth in 2004, and this duly occurred, albeit with some surprises to the upside - the world economy had its strongest performance for almost 30 years. There were some disappointments - yet another sluggish expansion in ""Old Europe"" for one - and some wild cards (oil prices at $50, for example), but in the main a host of countries achieved strong growth, including Ireland, the UK and most of Asia. ""New Europe"", too, did well, but the star performer has to be the US, again proving formidable in shaking off political and economic uncertainty to deliver a year of above-trend growth - Boston well and truly beat Berlin in 2004. 20041230220112 With GDP figures now available for the first nine months of the year, the US looks to have grown by about 4.5 per cent in 2004, well above its longer-term potential rate of 3.5 per cent, driven by a sharp rebound in business spending and a steady increase in consumer outlays. The US corporate sector initially responded to this increase in demand by boosting overtime working, but the sector gradually began to hire more labour, with the result that the economy created over two million jobs in 2004, pulling the unemployment rate down to 5.4 per cent from a cyclical high of 6.3 per cent in mid-2003. The sluggish labour market performance in the early part of the year was also seen as a threat to President Bush's re-election prospects, which is a revealing insight into the extraordinary difference in political economy between the US and Europe. In the former, an unemployment rate of 5.6 per cent, as it was in the spring, is seen as grounds for disqualifying a president from re-election, whereas an unemployment rate of 9 per cent in the euro area barely raises a political eyebrow. Indeed, blather from European leaders about a ""Lisbon Agenda"" for job-creation is given serious column inches in the European media when it would be laughed out of court in the US, where job-creation is rightly seen as a market response to strong economic growth. The US presidential election campaign also threw up the spectre of protectionism and proposals to curb investment abroad by US firms, phenomena which would have been very negative for Ireland, in particular, given the importance of foreign capital inflows. The Taoiseach saw this, if not the media - a victory for Senator John Kerry would have been bad for the Irish economy if he had chosen to pursue in office some of the politics he had espoused on the stump. From a global perspective, 2004 was also notable for an eastward shift in the balance of economic power, with Asia proving to be the most dynamic region, led by one old-timer, Japan, and a newer kid on the block in China. The former had been written off as a basket case for a decade, but it has bounced back, while the latter continues to grow at 9 per cent per annum, a feat which has propelled it into the top five in terms of world GDP. China is now a clear economic powerhouse, both as a major exporter of manufacturing and as a giant importer of raw materials and energy. The strength of this latter demand helped to propel a range of commodities to new price highs in 2004, including oil, to the detriment of western consumers. But the same consumers are benefiting from the plethora of cheap manufactured goods flowing out of Chinese factories, contributing to the low level of global inflation. China has also chosen to fix its currency to the dollar, so the desire of the financial markets to sell the US currency had to be satisfied elsewhere, with the result that the euro ended the year at new highs against the greenback. This was all the more inappropriate given yet another limp performance from the euro zone economy. The euro area's potential growth rate is now probably as low as 2 per cent, but output never even reached that level, making it the fourth year in succession in which the economy has under-performed relative to potential. Fortunately, the most recent set of data from France and Germany hints at some improvement, so the gloom about prospects in the euro zone during 2005 may prove overdone. Moreover, the dollar may well rally, underpinned by higher interest rates in the US. From an Irish perspective, one recent third-quarter statistic best encapsulated the economy in 2004 - the fact that employment rose by 57,000 over the previous 12 months. This not only highlighted the strength of Irish economic activity. It also underlined the real constraint facing the economy - a shortage of labour. Despite all the nonsense about competitiveness, the Republic is now back at full employment, so from here onwards the pace of economic growth will be constrained by the growth of the labour force. Fortunately, this is still expanding at a rapid clip for demographic reasons alone, but a key additional impetus has come from immigration, which has averaged over 30,000 per year in net terms since the millennium. Moreover, an increasing proportion of these workers are coming from the new EU accession states, which may come as a surprise to those who had envisaged a flight of capital in the other direction, but not to others familiar with the high unemployment and income-tax rates prevalent in eastern Europe. The strength of the domestic economy - annual GDP growth averaged 5.6 per cent in the first three-quarters of the year - also proved an unexpected welcoming gift to the new Minister for Finance, Mr Cowen, with tax receipts exceeding the 2004 Budget expectation by over EUR 2 billion. The Minister did not disappoint expectations and duly delivered an expansionary Budget for 2005, but it is fanciful to portray this as a departure from his predecessor's policies, either in terms of Government spending or in relation to taxation. Indeed, I suspect that his reluctance to widen the standard tax band by a substantial amount will be seen as a major negative as the new year unfolds, particularly as the projected increase in tax receipts is conservative, making another revenue overshoot more than likely. There is a plus side for Ireland to the dismal euro zone performance - interest rates have remained unusually low and are unlikely to rise to levels over the next few years which will materially cramp Irish economic activity. Consequently, GDP growth in Ireland is likely to remain in a 5-6 per cent range in 2005, although the main drivers may change, with personal consumption and exports likely to take over from construction and business spending as the main engines of growth. Inflation, too, will be well-behaved, and the major problem facing Irish business will again be how best to attract and retain labour - if one taxes capital at 12.5 per cent and labour at 48 per cent, one should not be surprised to end up with a lot of the former and a scarcity of the latter.

157,Irish Independent,16/10/2010,Breaking open the IMF's piggy bank would be Greek tragedy for economy,"One of the first maxims that a budding economist learns is that there is no free lunch. The saga of what happened to Greece over the past year, in requesting aid from Europe, should stand as a warning to the present Irish government.  EU aid will be no panacea for extricating Ireland from its budget predicaments. Indeed, there is no alternative -- other maybe than leaving the euro --to public budget austerity.  Greece's radical left-wing government has now blown out the candles celebrating its first year in power. But even before becoming prime minister, George Papandreou was left in no doubt as to the severity of the challenges facing Greece.  The outgoing conservatives had allowed public spending to explode in the run-up to the election, in the vain hope of cultivating votes. The public deficit went into double digits, with the debt-to-national income ratio well over 100pc.  Mr Papandreou was horrified by the hidden hole left by his predecessors. Interest rate payments alone on the national debt would be more than 7pc of government revenue each year, he was told.  Ethical  Mr Papandreou decided that massive austerity was neither feasible nor ethical. Greece then set about to ask for 'solidarity' from the European Union. This could be obtained without cost, or so it seemed. Other European countries borrowed at much lower yields.  So the plan was to simply get them to extend loans to Greece at the far better terms. That would have no upfront cash cost for the other governments, and it would keep foreign investors happy.  Mr Papandreou is a former sociology professor and a fervent internationalist. Burden-sharing with the rest of Europe to him seemed entirely rational in economic terms. It even seemed principled, given that Europe was gaining on trade with Greece. Thus began a campaign to request 'solidarity' from the EU that was to last months, and bring the EU to its most serious crisis yet. That crisis resulted in the establishment of a ginormous EUR750bn piggy bank that is now available to other eurozone governments, including Ireland, to tap into, should they ask for assistance with their funding.  My contacts in Greece were telling me, time and again, that once the solidarity came through, Greek borrowing rates would fall sharply. But the opposite happened. Yields skyrocketed, and Greece Inc was tainted with opprobrium.  Investors saw the provision of loans to Greece as just a blank cheque that opened the door to more fiscal irresponsibility. The direct involvement of Europe and the IMF in the domestic affairs of the country was seen as making the repayment of debt a political question, and an open question. Investors everywhere always abhor such uncertainty.  A call by Ireland now on the piggy bank provided by the IMF and the other eurozone governments would result in the death of the market for Irish bonds. Today it is very hard and quite costly for investment funds to either sell or buy Greek government bonds.  The Greek government no longer sells bonds, while many investors hoard the bonds they own. Even the ECB has been buying Greek bonds from some of the sellers. The end result is that the market for bonds hardly functions at all.  The easy part for the eurozone and the IMF was to dish out loans to Greece. The hard part, in a few years' time, is to envisage how it will ever get back to selling bonds in the market again. The same fate would befall Ireland as well if it were to seek 'solidarity'.  Worse than all of this would be the hit to reputation. Piggy banks are the preserve of kids. Blowing open the piggy bank is usually the last resort. It would be a signal to all of Ireland's trading partners that the risk of doing business is too high. A calamity for an open economy.  Yet Ireland's public deficit this year is running far above that of Greece, even without factoring in the cost of all the aid given to the banks.  The ratio of Ireland's public debt relative to national income could climb above that of Greece in a few years, under reasonable scenarios, unless there is a sharp change in government policies.  But borrowing from the eurozone/IMF piggy bank, probably at rates of around 5pc, is barely going to make a dent in the cost of rolling over the debt. So the only sure way for the Irish taxpayer to pay less in interest is to sharply rein in public spending and hike taxes over the coming years.  Welfare  Ireland has many advantages over Greece. For one, it is far richer. Wages in Ireland are among the highest in the EU. Income tax is almost zero for salaries below EUR30k a year. Some welfare benefits appear extraordinarily generous, compared to the rest of Europe. Ireland has virtually no wealth or residency taxes.  Pension entitlements are generous. Indeed, the present Government felt so confident last year on the budget outlook that it cut taxes on alcohol -- the only country in Europe that went out of its way to support the drinks industry and drinkers.  Foreign investors, when they study the figures for taxation and spending in Ireland, are all convinced that the budget can be brought under control if the government sets about it.  Some of the investors -- especially those that hold Irish government bonds -- tell me that they have been surprised at the readiness of the present Government to support domestic property and banking interests.  But they agree that Ireland is rich enough to be able to pay for all this aid. At the same time, they are reassured at the state access to a pot of ready cash.  Such wealth can either be further squandered, or else it can be used to decisively improve the outlook for public finances. Investors are giving the benefit of the doubt to Ireland for now. Ten-year government bonds are back to 6pc, ahead of the budget powwows.  That's their lowest level in a month. But investors will need to know shortly which way budget plans are heading, and if the present and the subsequent government will be up to the game.

158,The Irish Times,30/01/2012,Breaking the promissory notes to ease burden on State,"ANALYSIS:The Government and troika are trying to find a cheaper way of paying for Anglo and INBS SITTING IN an office on Burlington Road in Dublin 4 are nondescript documents that are the focus of the Government s efforts to reduce debts running to EUR 47 billion on the State. The office is the home of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, the undertaker bank that is burying the remains of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS), and the documents are promissory notes. The last government chose to provide the promissory notes or State IOUs to the lenders because it didn t have the cash to bail them. Since the notes were issued in March 2010, they have risen in value to cover EUR 30.6 billion of the EUR 34.7 billion cost of the failed banks (EUR 25.3 billion of the EUR 29.3 billion cost of Anglo and EUR 5.3 billion of INBS s EUR 5.4 billion cost). The Government is in talks with the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund to find a cheaper way to pay for these zombie banks and how the notes could be changed to achieve this. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has said that technical discussions were ongoing towards a paper being produced next month and the objective is to show the markets that Ireland s ability to pay its debts has improved. BACKGROUND To understand how the notes could be restructured, it is important to understand how they work. By issuing the notes, the Government agreed to inject a sum of money every year on March 31st to cover the EUR 31 billion in capital contributions to IBRC (Anglo/INBS). The original plan involved paying EUR 3.1 billion a year over a 10-year period. However, because the notes had to be valued at EUR 31 billion in IBRC, they had to be defined by Eurostat, the EU s statistics office, as a security and had to pay annual interest or a coupon to benefit the holder of the notes. The interest had to accrue on the sums due until the EUR 31 billion was paid. The rate was based on the long-term cost at which the State raises money at the time of the instalments. This was set at 5.8 per cent. In other words, the State had to pay IBRC, as the holder, this rate of annual interest on top of the EUR 31 billion. The Government decided to take an interest holiday for 2011 and 2012 so the budget deficits would not be as bad for those years. This raised the rate due to IBRC to 8.2 per cent a year for the remainder of the term on the notes. So, within the annual payment to IBRC, there is an interest payment. Much like a long-term mortgage, the payments in the early years of repayments comprise mostly interest. As it stands, the annual payments to IBRC, including interest, will be EUR 3.1 billion until 2023, EUR 2.1 billion in 2024, EUR 900 million a year until 2030 and EUR 100 million in 2031. All told, under the current structure of the notes, the Government is injecting EUR 47.4 billion into IBRC over 21 years, comprising EUR 30.6 billion in capital and EUR 16.8 billion in interest. The first EUR 3.1 billion payment was made in March 2011 so the lenders got hard cash instead of promises. This leaves EUR 28 billion of capital to be repaid (not including interest). Eurostat considered the notes and forced the Government to book the EUR 31 billion cost as an upfront charge the reason why the State deficit hit a jaw-dropping 32 per cent in 2010. The interest kicks in again this year and this must be added to the Government s deficit. That means for every interest payment to cover the State s 21-year mortgage on Anglo/INBS, the Government must raise taxes or cut spending by the same amount if it is to return the deficit to 3 per cent by 2015 as planned under the EU-IMF programme. Any restructuring of the notes that reduces the annual interest payment will help the Government reach the deficit target more easily. So, if the EUR 1.8 billion interest due in the EUR 3.1 billion 2014 payment was reduced, the Government would not have to raise a similar amount of tax and cut as much spending that year. The quicker the Government can get the deficit down the better. Restructuring the notes is the most efficient way to do this and certainly the most politically beneficial, given the public anger at having to pay for these two lenders. FUNDING ISSUE To complicate matters further, IBRC uses the notes as collateral to borrow emergency loans from the Central Bank through its exceptional liquidity assistance (ELA) facility. So, aside from the benefits of pushing out the capital payments to cover the huge cost of bad loans at Anglo/INBS, State-owned IBRC is using the notes to help fund its rundown at a much cheaper rate than if it were to source market funding (were that even possible). UCD economics professor Karl Whelan estimated at a conference last week that IBRC had about EUR 42 billion of ELA loans last year. ELA is a liability of the Irish Central Bank but it requires prior approval from Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan and the 16 other national central bank governors who sit on the ECB s governing council in Frankfurt. It is the subject of a letter of comfort from the Government, which commits to repaying the debt to the Central Bank if it is not repaid. One complication of ELA is that it is rolled over every fortnight so there is always a risk that the ECB could reject a proposal from the Central Bank to extend ELA loans to IBRC. IBRC might be getting 8.2 per cent interest on the notes from the State but it is paying the Central Bank about 3 per cent for ELA, which it repays as the bank s own loans are repaid. IBRC books the 5 per cent margin as income. This arrangement is regarded as a red herring as the State is paying 8 per cent on an IOU to IBRC, which is in turn paying the State s Central Bank 3 per cent on a loan that the Government says it will repay if IBRC can t. This means that the real cost of the structure of the notes is the EUR 3.1 billion the State must borrow every year to pump into IBRC. Reducing this figure is the key to a solution. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS Clearly, it would be a big win for the Government to get the promissory notes off the State s balance sheet and on to the European balance sheet to reduce the State s debts. Equally, it would be in the ECB s interest to get IBRC off central bank funding as running a dead bank whether the cash comes through loans from Frankfurt or an emergency credit line through its Dublin branch is anathema to the ECB s rules of engagement with banking. The ECB doesn t like national central banks extending ELA, as it is fearful of the effect on inflation and that it could promote moral hazard, where risky behaviour is rewarded. Also, given that ELA funds are provided on lower-quality collateral than the ECB will accept for providing loans, Frankfurt doesn t like the increased risks on this kind of loan. The best outcome for the State would be a long-term loan at a low rate directly to IBRC from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and its permanent successor, the European Stability Mechanism. The EU agreed last July to change the EFSF s rules to allow it to recapitalise banks but only through loans to governments. One newspaper reported yesterday that the Government would seek a long-term EFSF loan at 1 per cent which could reduce the interest bill from EUR 17 billion to EUR 5 billion, but the fund is unlikely to lend this cheaply.  The best outcome for Ireland is that the EFSF or ESM subsequently would provide us with a EUR 30 billion loan at a low interest, say 3 per cent over 50 years that would be a massive outcome, said Dermot O Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers. A lower rate of 3 per cent on a long-term loan would allow the Government to reduce interest and capital payments to IBRC, pushing them out over an even longer period. This eases the year-to-year drag on the deficit and avoids adding to the already tough budgetary measures to cover the higher yearly payments. The cheaper the loan and the longer its term, the more it would reduce the net present value of the debt to the Government. An added benefit is that the Government would reduce the size of IBRC s balance sheet by about EUR 30 billion in one fell swoop and make a statement to the markets that it has weaned its worst bank off central bank loans one of the catalysts for Ireland s 2010 bailout. It would remove the uncertainty hanging over the Government of the ECB approving fortnightly extensions on ELA loans. The downside is this will deprive IBRC of an income stream the 8.2 per cent interest from the State less the 3 per cent it pays for ELA and this could mean a further capital injection. Whelan suggested last week that the Government could ask that IBRC not to pay back the loans from the ELA or at least not begin repaying them until the economy recovered.  The liability is essentially a fiction. Central banks can create money and they can just as easily destroy money; they don t go bust.  This would require the approval of 11 members of the 17-strong ECB governing council. The Irish Central Bank could, in practice, only insist on repayment from IBRC if the State could afford it (so this option is unlikely now or for a long time into the future). If it were possible, this would in effect be a debt write-off but would only be recognised when the last IBRC loan is repaid. This could be 30 years from now, given that IBRC has long-term INBS residential mortgages on its books. The Central Bank and State could agree then that the gap between IBRC s remaining loans and the outstanding ELA be written off. But the idea of the ECB writing off ELA in the short term is unlikely to wash given that the ECB has refused haircuts on unguaranteed senior bondholders at IBRC, never mind on one of its own branches in the euro system. If IBRC defaulted on ELA loans and the State couldn t pay the debt, Frankfurt would in theory have to recapitalise the Central Bank. Media reports yesterday said the Government wanted to delay further payments on the notes until 2022 (though this was discounted by one source). Such a plan would help, but again IBRC would require the cash from somewhere else. Other options being considered include swapping the outstanding sum due on the notes (EUR 28 billion), in full or part, for another debt instrument that could be sold to raise funds from the EFSF or even privately. The notes could also be substituted with an in kind asset of similar value in full or part. The possible solutions are complex. Noonan wasn t wrong to use the word technical to describe the nature of the discussions on how to find a way of easing this heavy debt burden.",0,,,,,,
159,Irish Independent,12/10/2018,Brexit 'is a reason to cut taxes' - Donohoe; Minister says economic buffering has started but growing gaps in infrastructure must be key focus,"FINANCE Minister Paschal Donohoe believes Brexit is a reason to cut taxes further in order to stay competitive. Speaking at the Irish Independent Budget Breakfast, Mr Donohoe said the country's competitiveness in a post-Brexit era will depend on his ability to reduce income tax. He said ""economic buffering"" had started but the growing gaps in our infrastructure must be the key focus in the years ahead. Looking back at the two budgets he has introduced during his time in the ministry, he said he had done what he said he would do in relation to income tax. ""I've continued to stand by my view that it's not sustainable and increasingly won't be competitive to say that you can be on a normal, average wage here in Ireland and already be on a higher rate of income tax,"" he said. ""I believe this is an issue that is going to be exacerbated in a post-Brexit European Union."" In the UK, the higher rate of income tax is paid by workers earning more than £45,000 ((EURO)51,300). Under changes announced by Mr Donohoe on Tuesday, a worker here will begin paying the higher rate of tax on income earned after (EURO)35,300. The minister said in the past two budgets he had raised the point at which people began paying the higher rate of income tax by (EURO)1,500 and signalled that he would continue this trend in future budgets. ""I have done that because we have to address this issue over time,"" he said. Mr Donohoe rejected the charges that the tax changes were a sign that he had done too much or too little. An orderly transition would see Ireland moving into an environment of ""lower growth rates"" compared with recent years, he said. Mr Donohoe spoke about the dual challenges of international trade relations and Brexit facing Ireland, but said that it was his judgment things would remain ""favourable"", but warned circumstances ""are changing"". The minister said that he had to balance issues facing the country, such as the housing crisis, and the risks posed externally. The ""key"" Budget choice was the decision to ramp up capital spending to invest in the country's infrastructure, which was important to Brexit-proof the economy. ""What I've looked to do is add to the buffering of the domestic economy [that it] may need if external circumstances begin to change in a particular way, particularly in light of Brexit,"" he said. Lots of other finance ministers had promised to end the cycle of boom and boost, he said, but he acknowledged that there was likely to be another downturn. ""There will be another change in global economic circumstances. It will have an effect on Ireland. It's up to all of you to contend if I've done enough,"" he said. Mr Donohoe also spoke about the housing crisis facing the country. ""A roadmap will become clearer when it becomes clearer where we are in relation to Brexit,"" he said. He also faced questions from the French Ambassador to Ireland, Stéphane Crouzat, on his position on digital tax - which he noted had not changed but was starting to be shared among a growing list of EU countries - and on carbon tax. The Government has faced significant criticism for a rollback on hiking the carbon tax in this year's Budget - something that had long been mooted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. However, Mr Donohoe said he did not believe such a move would work in the absence of a long-term consensus in the Dáil. ""At a time in which we are facing an acute period of uncertainty, the call I made is that I don't believe that consensus is there,"" he said.

160,The Irish Times,23/11/2017,"Brexit and US tax policy cast shadow over Irish economy, says EU commission","Uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations and US tax and trade policy remain a shadow cast over Ireland's economic and budgetary prospects, the European Commission said  yesterday.  But the commission, in its autumn reports on member-state budget programmes, says its analysis of Irish prospects broadly matches that of the Government. Overall euro area growth, the commission says, conforms to its forecasts of 10 days ago, and is on track to grow at its fastest pace in a decade this year, with real GDP growth forecast at 2.2 per cent. In Ireland's case that was 4.8 per cent. The reports are part of the commission's autumn ""semester"" process, the procedure for the joint monitoring and assessment of member states' compliance with its economic guidelines and benchmarks. It sets out the EU's economic and social priorities for the year ahead, gives policy recommendation for the euro area and completes the assessment of euro area member states' draft budgetary plans. Ireland's draft budgetary plans for 2018 are viewed as broadly compliant with commission requirements although ""the plans might result in some deviation from ... its medium-term objective or the adjustment path towards it."" ""The macroeconomic scenario underlying the draft budgetary plan is plausible. It assumes that economic growth will remain robust, mostly in line with the April 2017 stability programme,"" the report says. 'Open economy '  Risks to the macroeconomic projections underlying the draft budgetary plan are tilted to the downside, it says.  ""The most important sources of uncertainty relate to the outcome of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU, as well as potential changes to United States tax and trade policies, to which Ireland is highly exposed as a small and very open economy."" ""Overall, the commission is of the opinion that the draft budgetary plan of Ireland ... is broadly compliant with the provisions of the stability and growth pact.  The commission invites the authorities to stand ready to take further measures within the national budgetary process to ensure that the 2018 budget will be compliant. Although not in the excessive deficit procedure, Ireland will be subject with 11 other states to an in-depth review by the commission to be published in February 2018.  These are the same countries identified as having imbalances in the previous round of the commission's macroeconomic imbalances procedure (MIP), ie Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

161,The Irish Times,16/07/2016,Brexit fallout and GDP figures . . .,"nThe Central Statistics (CSO) found a big pot of gold lying around this week, when it revised the Republic's GDP growth rate last year up to 26.3 per cent. That's four times the rate of China.  ""Leprechaun economics,"" was what Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said, while the Financial Times sarcastically lauded the Republic for producing yet another ""notable work of fiction"" to go with the works of James Joyce and Flann O'Brien.  The truth is the figure was hugely affected by one-off factors, including activity in the aircraft-leasing sector and restructuring by multinational companies involving the movement of patents and tax-driven mergers.  The bad news for the Government is that, in effect, with Michael Noonan creeping through the long grass in the hope nobody will pay too much attention to the State's corporate tax practices, the CSO has come up behind him, blasted a foghorn and drawn all eyes back to Ireland.  There is now likely to be increased scrutiny of how the Republic does its business with multinationals, and while Noonan initially seemed to brush it off as a sign the economy was ""continuing to grow"", he later smiled sheepishly at reporters and said the figure would not affect budget calculations.  Taoiseach Enda Kenny further clarified in the Dáil that the Government realises the figure is not representative of the real economy. The Department of Finance's figure for economic growth last year was in the region of 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent, he said.  This ""more normal growth rate'' was the basis for a budget kitty of about EUR 600 million for new spending, EUR 250 million for capital spending and less than EUR 350 million for tax cuts.  Central Bank governor Philip Lane was unimpressed with the episode and met the CSO to voice his concerns. The statisticians later said they would convene a meeting of high-level officials to examine how they might provide more accurate measures of economic performance in future.  A former Central Bank deputy was equally unimpressed. Stefan Gerlach, hired to help stabilise the financial system during the crisis, expressed fears the figure might be taken seriously.  ""Economic growth is not like a soccer game - a higher score isn't necessarily better,"" he said. ""While there are a lot of very serious politicians in Ireland, I am worried that people will look at the figures and ask why there is a need for any austerity.""  Fears about the reputational damage to the State were underlined when Moody's, one of the world's three main credit ratings agencies, said the highly volatile economic performance was one of its main concerns about the Republic's creditworthiness.  ""We caution that the revision . . . was heavily distorted by the transactions of a number of multinational entities, which have a limited impact on the domestic economy and the Government's repayment capacity,"" said its lead analyst on the Republic. n""I was the future once,"" declared a wistful David Cameron to the House of Commons in his final speech as prime minister on Wednesday, but  Britain now faces a very different vista. With new prime minister Theresa May firmly ensconced in Number 10, it's full speed ahead for Brexit.  The speedy nature of the Conservatives' leadership election helped to calm some of the nerves in financial markets - at least for the moment. And sterling leapt after the Bank of England left interest rates unchanged at 0.5 per cent.  This was despite widespread expectations of a rate cut to soften the economic impact of the vote. The British currency later eased back from its two-week high on the belief that a cut would happen soon. It had soared as high as $1.3480 after the rate announcement, up more than 2 per cent on the day and its strongest since June 30th.  British consumer confidence fell sharply, however, following the vote to leave. The Thomson Reuters/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index fell to 49.4 from 51.2.  Ulster Bank chief economist Richard Ramsey said economists had slashed growth forecasts for the UK economy, and warned that the UK and Northern Ireland could be headed into recession.  ""The consensus opinion is for marginal rates of growth next year, with an increasing number of economists expecting the UK economy to enter recession,"" he said.   ""Given its reliance on Great Britain, Northern Ireland would be very likely to follow suit.""  House prices in the North last month were hit by the uncertainty as buyers and sellers got cold feet. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and Ulster Bank residential market survey showed a ""downshift in sentiment"" in June as a result of both the EU referendum vote and the impact of a higher stamp duty in place on investment property sales.  In Dublin, the National Treasury Management Agency said it would take its time in assessing the long-term impact of Brexit on Ireland's bonds, as the ECB continues to provide massive support for euro zone government debt.  The implications of the vote are starting to be felt here, with Bank of Ireland saying the referendum had led it to increase its pension deficit. The bank said the impact on foreign exchange rates and interest rates had pushed the deficit for its defined-benefit pension scheme from EUR 740 million in December 2015 to EUR 1.2 billion at the end of June.  AIB warned the UK's vote could have ""a material impact"" on its business. ""The nature, timing and impact of a UK exit from the EU on the UK economy and trade is not fully known but may have negative consequences for the group,"" it said.  Separately, a study of about 1,000 Irish small and medium enterprises found 60 per cent expected a negative reaction from Brexit.  There were decreases in 10 out of the 12 economic indicators tracked for lobby group Isme's quarterly business trends survey. The study was conducted by Isme in the first week after the Brexit vote, while businesses were still processing the shock. nIn company news, UK property group Hammerson became one of the biggest players in the Irish retail sector after securing ownership of Dundrum Town Centre, as well as laying plans to take ownership of 50 per cent stakes in both the Ilac and Pavilions shopping centres in Dublin.  Brown Thomas then moved quickly to begin talks with Hammerson on increasing the size of its BT2 store at Dundrum Town shopping centre. Managing director Stephen Sealey said the store had been ""doing very, very well"".   Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon's, Tim Martin, said the ""dream is over"" in terms of having a dozen freehold pubs in central Dublin at a knockdown price.  His five Irish bars continue to perform well, but rising property prices and planning permission delays means expansion plans are effectively on hold at present. He was talking after the group announced a 5.5 per cent rise in total sales for the 50 weeks to July 10th, with like-for-like sales increasing by 3.4 per cent. nIn media, Virgin Media bought UTV Ireland from ITV for EUR 10 million in a deal that unites UTV Ireland with TV3 under the same ownership. Virgin Media said the agreement with ITV would also see it take over a 10-year supply deal for ITV-produced programmes including soap operas Coronation Street and Emmerdale.  In the newspaper sector, Paul Cooke resigned as managing director of the Sunday Business Post and sold his shareholding to its other shareholders, Key Capital.  The newspaper also announced it is to merge with the Cork-based printer Webprint, which Key Capital took control of last October.

162,The Irish Times,20/06/2019,Brexit fears drag down consumer sentiment; ERSI study shows impact on Republic's economy as consumers display caution," Brexit is already having a direct impact on the Republic's economy as consumers are more cautious about spending than would normally be expected against the backdrop of an unemployment rate at its lowest rate since 2005 and rising wages, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).  ESRI research officer Conor O'Toole noted to reporters ahead of the publication of the institute's latest quarterly economic commentary on Thursday that while consumer sentiment has fallen of a cliff this year, personal consumption remains pretty healthy and is expected to grow by 2.5 per cent for 2019 as a whole, down only marginally from 3 per cent last year.  ""It does suggest that consumption would have been higher, had these uncertainties [surrounding Brexit] been absent,"" said Mr O'Toole, adding that investment by businesses has also been slowing since late last year.  However, the ESRI has increased its full-year economic growth forecasts - measured by gross domestic product (GDP) - to 4 per cent from 3.8 per cent, helped by slight improvements in its outlook for Government and consumer spending, while leaving its 2020 projection unchanged at 3.2 per cent. The estimates are based on a scenario that the UK will leave the European Union this year with a trading status that remains equivalent to that of a full member of the union.  Even though personal consumption and business expenditure are running below where they might be if Brexit were not clouding sentiment, the Irish economy ""appears to be operating at its full potential level,"" according to the ESRI.  Wage increases ""The continued strong performance of the labour market has resulted in a significant increase in both nominal and real wages in recent years,"" it said. ""While wage increases due to productivity are warranted, care must be exercised to ensure that the competitiveness of the domestic economy is maintained."" The ESRI said that it ""may be advisable"" for the Government to take money out of the economy next year as the Government is currently on track to run small budget deficits in 2019 and 2020.  However, ESRI research professor Kieran McQuinn noted that the ""worst possible outcome"" would be to have a contractionary budget under a scenario of a hard Brexit. Budget 2020 is set to be unveiled by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe on October 8th, a little over three weeks before Brexit is currently scheduled to take effect.  Infrastructural projects The ESRI also warned that the Government must ensure that large infrastructural projects, which are essential for sustainable economic growth, are delivered ""on an efficient basis"". ""A number of high-profile cases have emerged recently where the final costs of certain projects seem to be significantly different from initial estimates,"" it said in the report. Rising costs associated with the national children's hospital and the national broadband plan have dominated political discourse in recent months.  ""Given the pace of growth in the economy at present, increases in expenditure must focus on capital projects that increase the productive capacity of the economy,"" it said.",0,,,,,,
163,The Irish Times,03/08/2019,Brexit is key to Varadkar's general election strategy,"In the weeks after the local and European elections, when the results were still being digested and interpreted, many in Fine Gael waited to see whether their party would act on what the voters had said.  Those who had been there in 2014 - when the party lost 100 council seats in the maelstrom of water charges - and believed it failed to heed the lessons of that outing.  Sitting TDs who hoped for a change of strategy or a reset before the summer recess and the August political lull.  Nothing came, aside from a nuts-and-bolts review of general election tickets.  Leo Varadkar set his face against a Cabinet reshuffle, the obvious way of telling voters your government has changed. The major policy announcement since the local and European elections - the climate action plan, launched in mid-June - had been in development for months. Fine Gael had a hugely successful European election, winning five seats, but its modest gain of 20 council seats fell short of initial expectations.  As they face into August, what troubles some in Fine Gael is that it may be too late to change course now.  Chasm  The corresponding statements released from Government Buildings and Downing Street after this week's phone call between Varadkar and Boris Johnson illustrated the chasm that now exists between London and Dublin on Brexit policy.  Johnson, demanding the backstop be abolished as a precondition to talks, is knowingly asking the impossible. Varadkar insists there can be no Brexit deal without the backstop. But in one, narrow area their interests align. They both need Brexit in order to achieve electoral success. It is just over two years since Varadkar won the leadership of his party with promises of a Republic of Opportunity and a rolling manifesto to ensure Fine Gael was election-ready at all times, with a swathe of policies to put to the people. Little is mentioned of either initiative now, nor of the Taoiseach's promise to reform the taxation system by merging PRSI and the universal social charge. Varadkar's other tax policy, to raise the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of income tax, is unlikely to be realised anytime soon, given a looming no-deal Brexit.  The Sláintecare plan to reform the health service proceeds slowly. The argument about housing has long been lost, even as the market in Dublin stabilises and supply increases.  As always, the process of government has taken over and restricted the time available for new policy formulation or strategic thinking.  Varadkar's own public standing has fallen and, similar to his predecessor, Enda Kenny, he is likely to have to rely on key lieutenants in an election campaign. Whereas Kenny could look to Michael Noonan and Phil Hogan, Varadkar will have to call on Simon Coveney and Paschal Donohoe. There is no time left for Varadkar to effect major change to Fine Gael policies or positioning in advance of the general election, likely to take place in the first half of 2020. From September, Brexit will consume all. A chaotic, crash-out Brexit now seems the likeliest scenario, unless the House of Commons can stop Johnson in his tracks.  The best hope for Ireland may lie in the UK, after the national catharsis of actually leaving the EU, agreeing to the backstop or a similar arrangement, such as an all- Ireland agrifood zone, as a precondition for a future trade deal with the EU.  Donohoe's budget will be dominated by supports for sectors of the economy at risk from a no-deal Brexit, as well as a carbon tax. The Government will soon have to detail exactly how and where checks will take place to protect the integrity of the single market.  Varadkar's defence of the backstop will be the dominant theme of politics between now and the general election, and Fine Gael will hope that it reaps electoral dividends.  It is likely to be more complex than that. Voters will be able to separate support for Brexit policy from concerns about domestic policy, but the Taoiseach has other advantages, if he uses them wisely.  He still has the platform of government to project himself and his Ministers.  Shadow of uncertainty  The economy is poised at a politically advantageous point where it is performing strongly but with a shadow of uncertainty - through Brexit or overheating - lingering in the background to persuade voters not to take a risk. Fianna Fáil, despite strategic gains in the local elections, is not streaking ahead of Fine Gael, even though it has established a lead in a series of recent opinion polls.  The Taoiseach will be pilloried in the Brexit-supporting UK press and by hardliners in the Tory party as he defends Irish interests, a gift to a leader whose domestic popularity is on the wane.  And in Johnson, a right-wing Tory, he could not have wished for a better opponent.  Earlier this year, Varadkar said that while Brexit had defined the UK, it would not define Ireland. The Taoiseach's best hope of returning to Government Buildings is that it defines him.",1,political,brexit,,,,uk
164,The Irish Times,28/06/2019,Brexit obscuring some of the hard choices Budget 2020 needs to address; Minister for Finance says exchequer can act as a shock absorber but is this a credible position?,"What he means by this is that the Government will let the State finances swing from a surplus to a deficit if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal. Instead of running a planned budget surplus of 0.4 per cent next year the Government would run a deficit of up to 1.5 per cent, effectively pushing up to EUR 4.5 billion back into the economy to counterbalance the fallout from a Brexit trade shock. ""Budgetary policy must lean against the wind, it must be counter-cyclical,"" he said in the Summer Economic Statement.  His twin-track approach to Brexit and his willingness to use the public purse as a buffer is being viewed as sensible in the circumstances. The problem, however, is one of credibility.  For decades Irish governments have driven a veritable coach and horses through their own budget plans, pulling last-minute budget day rabbits out of hats.  And budgetary policy has rarely leant against the wind; typically it tends to fly with it. Governments have spent lavishly during the booms only to be forced into swingeing cutbacks when the cyclical turns. So rather than smoothing the natural ups and downs of the economic cycle they have actively amplified them by pursuing pro-cyclical policies. The 2008 crash was a classic example. Clear-cut  In its latest assessment report the budgetary watchdog, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac), published a graph illustrating just how seldom fiscal policy here has been counter-cyclical.  In only four of the last 30 years have Irish governments maintained a clear-cut counter-cyclical stance. The graph charts a litany of budgetary mismanagement that stretches back to the 1980s. ""Ireland has a poor track record in terms of running a counter-cyclical fiscal policy,"" Ifac said. ""Instead budgets have tended to follow the cycle: expanding in good times and contracting in bad times. This has stoked pressures in the economy at times when it is overheating and has exacerbated subsequent downturns.""  One way to gauge how pro-cyclical government spending has been in recent years is to compare the Government's plans against what it actually ended up spending.  If we ignore interest costs, which are outside the Government's control, annual spending for 2018 was meant to be in region of EUR 63.7 billion, according to the budgetary framework. With various upward revisions to plans - both at budget time and within the year - spending last year turned out to be EUR 76.8 billion.  And that extra EUR 13 billion in spending is likely to be long-lasting and difficult to reverse. Much of the headline overruns relate to the health budget, which is again threatening to spill over this year on foot of increased payroll costs. Fine Gael, and Donohoe in particular, like to present themselves as financially disciplined but in reality they have struggled to rein in spending. Even on a project by project basis the national children's hospital and the National Broadband Plan suggest cost-containment has become a major issue for Government. Ifac says that, despite the favourable tailwinds behind the economy at the moment, the Government only managed to run a budget surplus this year for the first time in 11 years and even then largely by accident - on the back of surging corporation tax receipts. Prudence  It also noted that stronger tax revenues arising from the Republic's rapid cyclical recovery - surging corporation tax receipts, and interest cost savings - have essentially been swallowed up by faster-than-planned increases in annual spending. And in 2018, the pace of spending growth accelerated. Pursuing counter-cyclical policies is a difficult sell politically - not least with a general election looming. When the economy is growing, people demand higher wages and looser credit conditions, railing against fiscal prudence. Governments, often focused on short-term electoral gain, frequently acquiesce for fear of being kicked out of office. The Government says it cannot turn a ""blind eye"" to pressing needs in housing and health and is attempting to address these issues while maintaining fiscal probity - no easy task. Donohoe defends the Government's position by insisting that spending will only rise by 4 per cent in 2019. But that is from a different starting point than the Government had previously signalled - one that includes another EUR 1.1 billion in last-minute unplanned spending last year. If this is excluded spending this year is budgeted to rise by 6.5 per cent. The fiscal council claims this is unsustainable, and out of line with the long-run growth trajectory of the Irish economy, typically put at 3 per cent before inflation.  And there are likely to be further increases in the health spend next year, while the 2019 Christmas bonus payment to welfare recipients has yet to be factored in, both of which could push the spending dial further. KBC Bank economist Austin Hughes is less concerned with whether the Government's budgetary stance is expansionary or contractionary, only whether it makes sense. ""Most of the time it's last-minute, there isn't fiscal policy planning, there isn't the outline of a framework,"" he says.  The days of pulling ""budget day rabbits out of hats"" must be done away with. ""The evidence of recent years is that a couple of weeks before the budget we see dramatic changes in fiscal space or spending,"" he says. ""The planned trajectory in spending over the past four or five years bears no relationship to the outturns. You need to have frameworks that are credible.""  Hughes cites the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) latest quarterly outlook which suggests Brexit is already weighing on consumer spending here, even with near-record low unemployment and rising wages.  ""Perhaps part of the reason why consumers are so exercised about Brexit is that they fear we will have the same sort of calamitous public policy response that we saw in the financial crisis, where the government, rather than absorbing some of it, was forced to amplify the downturn because of the poor state of the public finances."" He says if Brexit is disorderly we may have an economic crisis but there's no reason for it to transform into a fiscal crisis similar to what happened in 2008 when badly managed public finances were overtaken by a global credit crunch. ""The fiscal stance is to be a shock absorber rather than a shock amplifier,"" he says, echoing the Minister's words. Overheating  If there is to be an orderly Brexit and the potential risk to trade from the UK's increasingly complex relationship with Europe recedes, the Irish economy may soon face the problem of overheating thanks to the rapid turnaround in employment and a marked pick-up in wages. Unemployment hit a post-crash low of 4.4 per cent last month, a figure that most economists think is tantamount to full employment in the Irish context. When employers chase a shrinking pool of labour, wages get bid up. To pay for higher wages, firms must put up their prices, which in turn feeds back into further wage demands from workers in a sort of negative feedback loop.  When such a wage-price spiral develops it can be difficult to halt. While experts talk of capacity and output gaps, the real evidence for overheating can be found in wages and prices. The ESRI suggests average hourly earnings grew by over 4 per cent last year and will grow by 4.5 per cent this year. ""That's quite a pick-up from the 2-2.5 per cent rate we've seen in recent years,"" the ESRI's Kieran McQuinn says. ""That's obviously nominal earnings but, given that inflation has been quite low, you're looking at fairly sizeable increases in real earnings as well."" The other side of the overheating equation is prices. While inflation, at barely 1 per cent, appears muted, McQuinn believes the weakness in sterling is anchoring it. If sterling was at a ""normal"" exchange rate with the euro inflation here could be much higher reflecting the high proportion of imports that come from the UK. ""So we're importing a lot of cheaper goods and services from the UK than would normally be the case. So that's helping to keep a lid on our inflation rate,"" McQuinn says. ""If sterling was to suddenly start climbing back up to a more historically normal rate, you could see costs building up quite significantly in the domestic economy."" In such circumstances the ESRI recommends some sort of contractionary budget for next year, taking some money out of the economy overall, perhaps through non-distortionary taxes such as property tax or a carbon tax. Sensible as this may be, both cause a ripple of fear in Government circles where the water charges fiasco remains a singular case study in how to lose votes. Ironically a no-deal Brexit could cancel out the economy's overheating issue, says McQuinn. ""A very disorderly Brexit would see a big, sharp economic shock for the domestic economy. While undesirable it would take care of any overheating issue,"" McQuinn says. Knife-edge  He acknowledges that framing budgetary policy in such uncertain time is extremely difficult.  The Department of Finance's chief economist John McCarthy said as much at a recent conference, suggesting the economy here was on a knife-edge, poised between ""overheating"" and a major Brexit-related downturn.  He described the situation as ""extraordinarily complex"" and uncertain, saying it made forming budgetary policy extremely difficult. One problem for the Government is timing. At the launch of the Summer Economic Statement this week, Donohoe said he would have to make an ""informed judgement"" as to whether there will be an orderly or crash-out Brexit in September, ahead of budget day on October 8th. It's unclear what new insight he will have come September. He has also ruled out plans for an emergency post-Brexit budget should things go awry.  Fianna Fáil's Michael McGrath and Labour leader Brendan Howlin are among those who believe the Government shouldn't rule out such an option.  A further issue for the public finances is that framing the budget around Brexit takes the focus off other pressing issues like housing and health.  But, ultimately, using potentially temporary corporation tax receipts to paper over the cracks in its health budget is not a sustainable position and one that needs to be tackled head on.",0,,,,,,
165,The Irish Times,17/08/2019,Brexit risks to North will make Ministers and officials lose sleep,"How do we get a grip on what a no-deal Brexit might feel like for us? It wouldn't be a rerun of the period after 2008, when GDP crashed by close to 10 per cent over two years and the banks and then the State had to be bailed out.  Nor would the economic after-effects be as deep and far-reaching. But of course saying something won't be as bad as the biggest crash any of us have seen isn't the best of reassurance.  It's like saying that the next storm won't be as bad as the last one that knocked your house over and left a trail of destruction. So how do we get a grip on what it might feel like? The essence of the no-deal Brexit economic impact is that it will hit quickly. The initial forecasts of how Brexit would affect our economy were based on the - then reasonable - assumption that there would be a withdrawal deal.  This would have pushed any significant impact out for a couple of years and after that there were a range of scenarios, depending on what kind of a trade deal was done between the European Union and the UK.  A no-deal exit brings all the risks and costs forward and, by tearing up trading and commercial links based on a host of EU rules and custom and practice, throws in a bag of unknowns and uncertainty. Because the change happens quickly, the costs accrue much more rapidly too.  So rather than, say, one percentage point off the economic growth rate each year for five years, forecasters feel 2.5 to four points could be knocked off in the first year to 18 months.  If this is right, rather than GDP growth of 3.5 to 4 per cent next year, we might not see much growth at all and - on the more pessimistic forecasts - a recession could not be ruled out. Forecasting this is all the more tricky as the impact of a no-deal will hit some sectors of the economy and some parts of the country hard, but in terms of a direct impact , others will be spared.  If you work in an international bank in the IFSC, for example, Brexit might bring new opportunities as other parts of your company's business relocate from London.  Immediate threat If you work in a beef processing plant, on the other hand, which relies on the UK market, then your job could come under immediate threat.  So the direct impact will hit sectors which are affected most by the changes to trade after Brexit - the food industry, particularly beef, and parts of the engineering and heavy goods sectors.  Beef, a sector already in trouble, is the clearest example, with producers likely to face punishing tariffs in the UK market.  Because the food sectors and SMEs in sectors such as engineering are most exposed, this means the parts of the country in which these kinds of firms are generally located are most at risk - and this means rural Ireland.  This is where the Brexit economy story will play out, requiring government supports and a range of interventions. Cash-flow shortages will be a big issue for many smaller firms.  The Government faces a firefight to save jobs. As support will require EU clearance - on the basis of ongoing viability - this is not a straightforward task. The wider economy will also be hit, but the direct impact will be less severe. Import prices will go up, possibly costing the average family more than EUR 1,000 a year in higher prices, according to an ESRI study.  But the real question, and the difficult one to judge, is how far confidence will be hit - and this is what would spread the economic hit from a no-deal Brexit by affecting what consumers spend, what businesses invest and leak into areas like car sales, house prices and so on.  More pessimistic forecasts, such as those from the Central Bank, factor in a hit to confidence, while the less gloomy estimates from the Department of Finance and ESRI focus more on the direct impacts from changes to trade.  How long the worst of the economic impact would last will depend in part on how Brexit plays out politically - and whether both sides sit down to try to hammer out some deal.  The risk is that this could all takes years to work out, as the EU rules mean, to paraphrase the radio ad, ""once you're gone, you're gone"".  Slower growth The economic impact is going to be a headache for the Government, though it will hope that after the initial shock and possibly a year or two of significantly slower growth, some kind of normality might return.  It will be even more concerned, however, about the political - and economic - impact in the North.  Here the economic hit will be harder, the uncertainties great and the politics quite possibly toxic. In September, if we do appear to be heading to a no-deal, the whole issue of the Border will move centre stage and the Government will have to outline its plans in the event of a no-deal.  And if a no-deal takes place, then the risks - to society and politics - in the North are considerable and the political questions raised are enormous.  The economic challenges for the Government are nasty - but there are obvious courses of action to respond. What to do about the Border and the North, however, throws up a lot of awkward and difficult questions - and few clear or obvious answers.  The Government will worry about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit, but it is the risks to the North which will keep Ministers and officials awake at night.",1,trade,brexit,,,,uk
166,Irish Independent,18/09/2018,"Brexit shocks will force farm collapse, Central Bank warns; Beef sector will now be 'particularly vulnerable' to risk ; Brexit risks for farmers as CAP payments to fall","BREXIT could push at-risk Irish farms closer to the point of collapse, the Central Bank has warned. In economic analysis issued as the Ploughing Championships begin in Tullamore today, they said that risks such as Brexit could ""expose the existing viability challenges facing some Irish farmers"". The analysis highlighted the reliance on the UK market, with just over 40pc of the agri-food exports going there. It added that the beef sector ""appears particularly vulnerable to a Brexit shock"". Analysis: Irish farming cannot follow Britain down the Brexit rabbit hole 4 The Deputy governor of the Central Bank, Sharon Donnery, said that there are specific challenges facing farmers. ""The fact remains that a hard Brexit which reduces market access for Irish exports would have a material negative effect on Irish agriculture and adjusting to this in the shortterm would prove a considerable challenge."" Continued on Page 5 Continued from Page 1 The research pointed out that the percentage of EU funding allocated Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) payments had plummeted by more than 30pc in just over 30 years. In 1985, the CAP expenditure equated to some 73pc of the EU's overall budget. However, this dropped to 41pc in 2016, with the EU Commission proposing a further decrease of 5pc. The Central Bank said that it is likely the EU Budget will be further affected by the UK's exit, with the loss of their annual net contribution. As part of its conclusions they say that this, along with the uncertainty of Brexit, will be a considerable challenge to farmers. Since 2005, CAP payments have accounted for just under 75pc of total farm income. Ms Donnery said that agriculture still makes a significant contribution to the Irish economy. ""However, Brexit continues to pose huge uncertainty to the Irish economy overall, and today's research spells out the specific challenges faced by those working in the agri-food sector across the country,"" she said. The letter, written by Central Bank economist Thomas Conefrey, pointed to three Brexit factors that could negatively affect Irish farmers: :: The degree of reliance of specific sectors/products on the UK market; :: The reduction in UK market access for Irish exporters due to tariff and non-tariff barriers; :: The degree of resilience of different sectors based on their profitability and dependence on direct payments. Mr Conefrey indicated a reliance on the UK market across a number of different sectors. Sub-sectors such as cereal and fruit and vegetables accounted for 90pc and 84pc of respective exports. These would be placed in the heavy reliance sectors. Dairy exports to the UK account for 35pc of the total. The letter said that the beef sector would be particularly vulnerable by border delays associated with a hard Brexit. About 50pc of Irish beef Warning: Central Bank economist Thomas Conefrey exports go to the UK. The Central Bank says that in a hard-Brexit scenario, ""agriculture products would attract some of the highest tariffs"". ""Estimates from Teagasc show that the tariff on fresh boneless beef, which accounts for two-thirds of the value of beef exports to the UK, would be 69pc."" Potential delays as a result off non-tariff barriers could result in an estimated drop of 9.6pc in overall trade - exports and imports - between Ireland and the UK once the UK exit the EU.",1,trade,brexit,,,,uk

Fine Gael is leading a hybrid minority coalition and Fianna Fáil is both in opposition and keeping the current strange government in power. Where does that leave them - and the rest of us - trying to make sense of a political system we have never before encountered? The ""big two"", Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have dominated national life since this State's foundation. At one stage, their combined vote amounted to four out of five of the nation's adults. Now that combined vote hovers around half the national electorate. Since 2011, Fine Gael has managed a reverse ferret and edged ahead of Fianna Fáil. Each party deserves kudos for providing government after the fragmented result in the last general election in February 2016. But their strange collaboration has given us a further blurring of boundaries as aged tribal loyalties also fade with the passing generations. Leo Varadkar, an openly gay man with an immigrant background, caught the public imagination after his election as Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach in June 2017. His Government's handling of Brexit in the ensuing months certainly impressed people. But Micheál Martin's persistence and courage in managing his party's strange and unprecedented position has more recently paid off. Yesterday's opinion poll tells us that Fine Gael is on 29pc to Fianna Fáil's 28pc. Not much between the pair, then, and it suggests that the public is very much undecided. Sinn Féin is on just 12pc, again confirming that it is stuck in the doldrums, despite the expected fillip that Mary Lou McDonald's election as a ""post-war leader"" was supposed to deliver in February 2018. The Independents are collectively on 13pc, while Labour is still stuck on 6pc, and the Green Party on an interesting 7pc. That is roughly where the Greens were in the May 2007 general election when they won six Dáil seats and went into government with Fianna Fáil. Thus, note Leo Varadkar having a pop at the Greens during his party's get-together in Cork last week. Eamon Ryan and company might be kingmakers again. The worrying part for Fine Gael activists is that they were on a 33pc rating early this year. Fianna Fáil people will be happy at the ground they have made up over the past year, with a good local election outcome in May. Mr Martin has also shown that his party has the ability to buck the opinion poll findings and do better at the ballot box, where it really counts. There is, however, some solace for Fine Gael. The survey shows that 47pc of people believe that Mr Varadkar is a better Brexit operator. Mr Martin is rated as best at Brexit by just 34pc. It does suggest that Fine Gael has an edge which is more than one percentage point here. But, then again, it also tells us that Brexit will very likely decide whether it will be Leo or Micheál for anchor tenant in Government Buildings next summer. The Red C pollster, Richard Colwell, notes that even one-third of Fianna Fáil voters rate Mr Varadkar as the more reliable person for Ireland's Brexit wars. Brexit - and where it might land - has us all rather petrified. It has taken money out of the shops. This latest Red C survey tells us that one in five people admit to spending less pending what may well be a negative Brexit outcome. The poll shows Fine Gael rated well in managing Brexit. But the party has cause for concern when it comes to the crucial issues of housing and health. All of the parties struggle to find out how to gain votes from these two elemental issues. The problem is that most voters have a home, and be they ever so sympathetic towards those without, the issue may not be the decisive one when deciding how to vote. Similarly, unless the voter, or somebody close to them, is seriously ill and suffering inadequate treatment, health may not be the decider. There is a perennial air of hopelessness surrounding health, and let's recall that Mr Martin was himself an under-achieving boom-time health minister. But Fine Gael will hope for better weather on the housing front next year as it faces the voters. All eyes will be on Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe as he puts the finishing touches to Budget 2020, to be presented on October 8. Mr Donohoe must reclaim his party's natural hinterland of prudent economic management, supported by warnings that Brexit bodes for a very uncertain future. In these uncertain times, tax cuts are unlikely to attract mainstream support. The Fianna Fáil gut call in the last general election - that protecting and enhancing public services was the public's wish - still seems to hold sway. Almost two out of three people in that Red C poll said they would prefer more spending on public services over tax cuts or increased welfare payments. But, as with everything else in politics, timing is crucial here. The current Brexit crisis may well have been played out before this year ends. The issue itself will continue for years to come. But the point is that even keen students of politics are showing signs of fatigue on this very vexed topic. If Brexit is at least ""parked"", then the election in 2020 may very well be fought on very different issues. That brings us back to housing in particular. Everyone in Fine Gael will hope that the ""corner has been turned"" on this issue. Even ardent party people have been dismayed at the lack of signs of progress up to now. They have also been a little wearied by Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy's lack of credibility. This is the issue they must address. Leo Varadkar had a pop at the Greens during his party's get-together in Cork last week. Eamon Ryan and company might be kingmakers again ;",0,,,,,,
168,The Irish Times,28/06/2016,"Brexit will not affect budget, says Kenny; Taoiseach sees no immediate change to flow of people, goods and services to UK"," The UK vote to leave the European Union will not have any effect on the Government's fiscal space for the 2017 budget, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. Prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years had placed the State in a stronger position to weather the consequences of the Brexit result, Mr Kenny said. He was speaking at the Government's National Economic Dialogue in Dublin Castle yesterday. He told the representatives of trade unions, employer bodies, farmers, social justice campaigners and voluntary organisations at the event that there would be no immediate change to the free flow of people, goods and services between Britain and Ireland as a result of Brexit. In his speech Mr Kenny said he was ""saddened and disappointed"" at the result of the Brexit referendum. The conference aims to provide a forum for various representative and voluntary groups to have a say on how they believe the budget next year should be framed. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe, who also spoke at the event, said the Government would deliver the budgets for this year and next year as planned despite the outcome of the Brexit referendum. Speaking on his way into the conference, Mr Noonan said there was no sense of panic in Ireland and that the initial shock following the UK decision to leave the European Union had been contained.  Ultimate effect  Mr Noonan said it would be impossible to calculate the effect of Brexit on Ireland until the final settlement between the UK and the EU was agreed.  ""It is very hard to say what the ultimate effect of Brexit will be because it depends on the alternative arrangement which is put in place.""  The Minister said that if something like the arrangement in Norway was put in place then you are looking at very little downside. ""But if it becomes an arrangement of tariffs and inhibitions of exports and imports and interference with common travel areas and labour markets, well then the effect could be profound."" Mr Noonan also harshly criticised Eurostat for what he said was a lack of consistency in approach, particularly on Irish Water.  House construction  Also at the event the Irish Congress of Trade Unions maintained that the Government's plan to increase current and capital spending by 2 per cent for 2017 was ""wholly inadequate"" and recommended the investment target should be at least 4 per cent.  It said the State needed to immediately accelerate house construction with a substantial increase in the capital budget for 2017.  Unions called for the health service to receive a minimum of 10 per cent of GDP on a sustained and continuous basis. Employers' lobby group Ibec said the Government must be vigilant on cost competitiveness and ensure that enterprises did not face any regulatory, labour cost or tax increases while the current period of uncertainty and exchange rate volatility existed. It said the Government must prioritise available budgetary resources for investment spending.  Ibec argued that it was vital that the resources available for budget 2017 were invested wisely in the economy through infrastructure, innovation and labour market measures that would underpin competitiveness . Both unions and employers urged the Government to push harder to secure greater flexibility in EU fiscal rules. Social Justice Ireland called for investment in social housing and broadband, a rise in social welfare rates. and the introduction of refundable tax credits. It urged the putting in place of a minimum effective corporate tax rate and the provision of sufficient resources for the new Independent Budget Office. ",1,trade,brexit,,,,uk
169,The Irish Times,23/08/2017,Brexit will sour 'jam tomorrow' plans for tax cuts in coming budgets,"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe are going to present a three-year programme for public finances in the Budget. It will help businesses and the public plan, the Taoiseach said.  Hard to argue with that - and if it is a move away from the long and dishonourable traditional of trying to cook up some surprises on Budget day each year, then all the better. But there may be another motivation for the three-year strategy this year. It will allow the Government to promise some juicy enough tax cuts and spending increases in the latter two years. There isn't a lot of cash available this year, but - on current projections - there will be for the 2019 and 2020 Budgets.  Politically, the Government is hoping that this ""jam tomorrow"" strategy will keep voters on board.  Tight enough  On current projections there might only be EUR 300 million to distribute in new tax and spending measures in Budget 2018, which will be presented in October. You would suspect that a bit more will be found from somewhere before the day itself, but either way the package will be tight enough.  The Government will have to find savings or some increased taxes to pay for any significant new measures - and in the current political set-up that won't be easily achieved. You can just see all the big lobby groups playing Fine Gael, the Independents and Fianna Fáil off against each other.  Just watch the tourism lobby in action if there is any talk of increasing the 9 per cent Vat rate, for example. Caught in a bind for Budget 2018, the Government wants to hold out the promise of more in the years ahead. The forecasts are that the room for manoeuvre in Budget 2019 will be EUR 3.2 billion, with EUR 3.4 billion available the following year.  Happy days, you might think, for the Minister for Finance who gets to present those Budgets. It might not quite be back to the ""Champagne Charlie"" headlines of the McCreevy era of the early 2000s, but "" Prosecco Paschal"" would, if the forecasts prove correct, have a significant enough amount to play with.  Even on the Government commitment to use two-thirds of any leeway for extra spending and one-third for tax reductions, this would still leave some room to take a chunk out of USC or income tax over a couple of years and promise some extra spending in key areas.  Of course the key phrase in all this is ""on current projections"". We have seen how Budget prospects can turn on the proverbial sixpence, if economic growth turns downwards. Revenues and spending are both very large numbers each year - both in excess of EUR 60 billion.  High reliance All you need is for tax to come in a bit below expectations and spending a bit above and your projections are in trouble. Our high reliance on corporation tax and our limited understanding of what is driving this revenue are  other risk factors.  And then, of course, there is the obvious point. Brexit happens five months after Budget 2019 is announced. You would presume by then we will know more about the shape it will take, though on the speed the talks have been moving at so far, you wouldn't be at all sure of that. If Britain is heading for a hard Brexit and particularly if it looks like it might crash out of the EU with no deal, then we will be seeing some economic nerves by next year and will face considerable uncertainty heading into 2019. Your guess about how likely this is will be as good as mine, but it can't be ignored.  If the three-year Budget plan is to mean anything, it needs to confront this head on. There is little point in promising people income tax or USC cuts in 2019 and 2020 as a matter of certainty, if the numbers are built on a foundation of uncertainty. This is no fault of those who made the forecasts, of course - it is just the situation we find ourselves in.  Flexibility Against this backdrop, if the Budget is really to prepare us for Brexit, it needs first to make clear that nothing will be done to throw the public finances off course. Above all, we need some room for flexibility in the public finances if the immediate Brexit hit to growth is more significant than currently forecast.  Beyond that, the Budget plan then needs to set priorities. Top of the list needs to be key pieces of social and economic infrastructure - housing, investment in water and some other key projects. Then there are a hundred and one other demands for day-to-day spending and tax cuts.  There are key problems in the tax code which need to be fixed . One of them is the low income level at which people enter the top tax rate. Another is the need to decide on the future of property tax, which can be a long-term stable source of revenue, but needs to be structured correctly.  But I wonder are taxes now the top priority of voters? Asked in surveys do we want to pay lower taxes, we will all say ""yes"".  But where does this really rank against priorities such as housing, health and education?  If the Government uses the three-year plan to pursue a ""jam tomorrow"" tax cut plan, it will have little credibility against the backdrop of Brexit. A proper plan needs to recognise the huge uncertainty that this presents, and set down a considered way to respond. Promising a point off the main USC rate each year does not constitute a strategy.",0,,,,,,
170,The Irish Times,03/01/2020,"Brexit, trade wars and general election to dominate economic agenda in 2020; 2020 will likely be another year of living dangerously for business","Last year the Irish economy dodged the bullets. The prospect of the UK crashing out of the European Union without a withdrawal agreement was taken off the table. Trade tensions ebbed and flowed, but did not explode. Talk on international tax reform continued - but with no agreement yet. These risks were all postponed - not removed. But despite the resulting uncertainty, the economy still put in a strong performance.  What about 2020? It looks like another year of living dangerously - with all the major risks still on the table. With no clarity on the more significant threats likely until later in the year - if then - the economy enters the year with significant momentum. But predicting how it will end in 2020 is another matter entirely. Here are five key things to watch. 1Brexit - the trade talks The same story, only different. Last year was dominated by the threat of a ""no-deal"" or ""crash-out"" Brexit. This was avoided but as we enter 2020 another kind of no-deal comes into focus - the risk of the UK leaving the transition period at the end of this year without having agreed a trade deal with the EU. This would lead to serious challenges in Irish trade with the UK, notably in sectors like food. And even if there is a deal, there may still be new trade challenges. So what indicators do we need to watch? The first is whether Johnson does a U-turn on his intention, now written into in the UK withdrawal Bill, not to extend the transition period, due to run out at the end of 2020. An extension for one or two years is possible, though Johnson has so far set his face against this, despite warnings from senior EU figures that this may not leave enough time for a deal. EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has predicted that he might, indeed, blink. If there is no extension, expect the temperature to rise in the second half of this year as the end of December deadline approaches. We then need to see whether the EU and UK could do a basic deal on trade in goods by this deadline - seen as the most that could be achieved - leaving areas like services and data exchange for later talks. Even doing this would require a deal on fisheries - likely to be highly controversial - and a commitment by the UK not to cut its standards in areas like the environment and workers' rights.  The size of Boris Johnson's majority does give him scope in terms of what kind of Brexit he wants to see. But the basic choice is clear - the more the UK diverges from EU rules and regulations, the less free access UK businesses will have to EU markets. We still don't know how Johnson will call this one, despite the hard Brexit drumbeats currently sounding. 2  Brexit  - Northern Ireland As well as talks on a new EU/UK trade deal, separate negotiations will take place in a joint committee on how the new trade arrangements for Northern Ireland contained in the withdrawal agreement will work in practice. Under its provisions, goods are set to be checked crossing the Irish Sea - meaning no Border checks here. Because the North will remain part of the UK's customs territory, this requires some complex new rules and procedures to ensure tariffs are collected on some goods entering the North from Britain, with refunds available to businesses selling these products in the North. There will also be some bureaucracy on goods heading from the North into the UK. As this arrangement was agreed late in the day - following the meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Boris Johnson near Liverpool in October - details of how it will operate have still to be worked out. This new regime is due to commence in January 2021, so time is short here, too. And it is vital for Ireland, North and South, that this works. Businesses in the North will want certainty, and to minimise disruption. For the Republic, it is vital that the EU is satisfied that the proper checks and controls are taking place on goods entering the single market.  These talks are separate to the trade negotiations, but there is a link. If the EU and UK agree a trade deal involving no tariffs on goods, then it does remove one complication in relation to the North. But a failure to agree an EU/UK deal would make the new arrangements for the North all the more complicated. 3 Trade wars - or peace?The arrival of Donald Trump to the White House has threatened to overturn the practice of global trade. The World Trade Organisation, which oversees disputes, has been seriously damaged by the US blocking appointments to its Appellate Body - which hears appeals against WTO panel rulings. This threatens to upend the whole dispute resolution mechanism used to solve rows in international trade and thus threatens the entire multilateral structure overseeing trade.  Trump has taken an aggressive approach of slapping tariffs - special duties - on imports from countries that he sees as treating the US unfairly, a further move away from the multilateral process. Late last year the US and China reached a deal to try to end 18 months of building tensions and tit-for-tat tariffs. Under the deal, the US has agreed to reduce some tariffs in return for more Chinese purchases of American products and better protection of intellectual property. US shares soared in end of year trading as a result. But we have seen before how such deals can fall apart in the blink of an eye with a Trump tweet.  Whether the US/China deal holds will be a key marker in 2020. And Trump has also targeted the EU, backed by this time a WTO decision on subsidies to Airbus and the impact these had on Boeing, with Irish butter and cheese exports hit and whiskey threatened. As a small exporting economy with a significant reliance on the US market, this is a vital one for Ireland. 4 Corporate tax reform comes to the boil For many years Ireland's corporate tax regime was the subject of sniping from Europe, but efforts to agree change at EU level never came to much. However, talks are now under way under the aegis of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), involving 135 countries seeking to agree a wide reform programme.  The first phase of the so-called BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) programme has already led to change. Ironically, some of this has benefited Ireland significantly and contributed to soaring corporate tax revenues.  However, the second phase of the talks, due to conclude this year, carry threats for Ireland. The first part of the talks - so-called pillar one - had looked like it was heading for agreement. This would involve big companies paying some corporation tax relating to sales from digital interactions with consumers. This would mean some revenue loss to Ireland - and gains for countries with big markets like Germany and France. However, a letter from the US to the OECD in December, arguing that this may be unfair to US companies, has cast doubt on its support for this plan, which most had thought to be solid.  The second phase of talks - pillar two - is more dangerous for Ireland. It would involve setting a minimum corporate tax rate - a bottom line that companies must pay on their profits. Depending on what rate was set, and how this worked, this could put a serious dent in our ability to use our 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate as a tool to attract investment here. A lot of detail remains to be worked out, including the basis on which this tax would work. The US objections to the pillar one proposal has thrown a bit of uncertainty over the whole process, as the US had been seen as a support of a multilateral approach in this area. January and February will tell a lot, as progress will be needed on the basis of updated proposals due from the OECD. Another key one to watch. A big issue here for Ireland is that if the OECD process collapses, more countries will press ahead with unilateral measures - France has introduced a digital sales tax already. And we could also come under pressure at EU level where there would likely be a push to dust down reform plans, previously rejected by a succession of Irish ministers, including Paschal Donohoe. 5 Electionomics - Irish style We are going to have a general election in 2020 even if we don't know when. The legacy of the bust means that the big parties will all agree to stick by the EU budget rules, even if the emphasis varies. But how will they define themselves as being different? With Fine Gael, we presume they will stick to the general economic and budgetary goals set out now by the party in government. But it was interesting to see Taoiseach Leo Varadkar again promising recently to aim tax relief at middle earners, as well as focusing on spending priorities. He clearly sees this as a vote winner for Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil may well focus more on spending and try to hit Fine Gael hard in areas like health and housing. The Greens will be, well, green, Sinn Féin will presumably dust down plans to increase taxes on the rich to fund higher spending. Labour will push an ""equality"" agenda majoring on spending on health, housing - including a rental cap - and climate change. But where will the sparks fly? Housing is the obvious one and how Fianna Fáil stakes out this ground will be interesting to watch. Supply is now increasing but the Opposition will still see the Government as vulnerable here. Carbon tax is another possible area of contention - how fast to increase it, what to do with the money and how to protect poorer households. And there is likely to be a big ""consumerist"" agenda, with parties putting forward different proposals to safeguard the public, following years of scandals in areas like tracker mortgages and controversy over insurance costs and availability.  But a lot of it will be Fine Gael saying you can't trust anyone else with the economy and the rest, in various ways, saying Fine Gael hasn't delivered in key areas, despite buoyant revenues.",1,trade,brexit,,,,uk
979,Irish Independent,17/06/2020,"NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE POWER, NOT SHY AWAY FROM IT","HERE has been enough adrenaline pumped through the political system without further fuelling anxieties. TEven wars of nerves can have casualties, so Taoiseach Leo Varadkar's warning of a political crisis if the proposed coalition government deal is not approved is salutary. The people of our country have been staring fear in the face for months, stripped of all the comforts of normality. Now is a time for certainty and going forward without hesitancy. There is no longer room for ambivalence among members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party. The programme is to be put to the membership of all three parties, with ballot results expected within 10 days. ""If the deal doesn't go through, well then we do not have a new government and that precipitates a political crisis,"" Mr Varadkar said yesterday. Rejection at this point would be a dereliction. Leadership and statecraft are about a whole lot more than yielding to fads or indulging momentary moods. The Greens should recognise their hour has arrived, and grab the chance to become a transformative force in politics. It's true, there was incredulity when deputy leader Catherine Martin made known she was challenging Eamon Ryan to head the party just as government talks began. It's also evident her endorsement of a deal she helped negotiate was less than full-blooded. The party did not get all it required but she was satisfied it was the ""best achievable"". But, critically, Ms Martin recognised the country needs stability and political certainty ""at a time when the national health emergency continues to cause loss, untold heartbreak and suffering"". But another member of her party, Saoirse McHugh, said: ""It [the deal] will be a very hard sell for Green Party members."" She feared her party could be in government but without power. There is no question the party will have power: as to whether it gets the recognition it might hope for must be a matter for another day. The pandemic has presented a bewildering series of problems. In such times, politicians should deem it a privilege to serve. The Greens have nothing to fear - a trap is after all only a trap when you don't know about it so when you do, it merely becomes a challenge to be met. We are past entertaining any delusions we have choices other than to confront what is bearing down on us. According to the Fiscal Advisory Council, it could take the economy three and a half years to return to pre-crisis levels. A massive stimulus package has been called for to accelerate the recovery, while the Central Bank has warned the scale of the economic shock is ""unprecedented"". Borrowers and banks will be put under intense pressure and that bodes ill for all, as well we know. Central Bank governor Gabriel Makhlouf said governments are facing ""fantastic levels of uncertainty"". All responsible public representatives must surely see this is a time to take power, not shy away from it. Borrowers and banks willbe under intense pressure and that bodes ill for all",1,political,elections,,,,ireland
295,The Irish Times,10/07/2010,Coalition will need resolve and luck to see out year,"INSIDE POLITICS:The real problem from now on is that cuts in spending will bite into services for some of the most vulnerable, writes STEPHEN COLLINS THE COALITION has made it safely past its third birthday and into the Dáil summer recess. That is no mean achievement, given the enormous stresses and strains it has had to cope with during the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Whether Fianna Fáil and the Green Party will be able to hold together and agree on another swingeing budget for next year will be the dominant political issue in the autumn. Given their low standing in the polls both parties have a strong incentive to postpone an election for as long as possible but it will take a great deal of resolve and a bit of luck to make it to the end of the year. Whatever they might say in public, the Opposition parties would like to see the Government take the responsibility for another tough budget. Ideally Fine Gael and Labour would like to have an election in the spring or early summer of 2011 while the Coalition parties would prefer to have it a year later at the end of a full Dáil term. Given the uncertainties of politics there is no guarantee that either Government or Opposition will get what they wish for. Events have a habit of upsetting the best laid plans but, as long as they stick together, the Coalition parties have a chance of remaining in the driving seat. Ministers will take a detailed look at the budget options over the next couple of weeks before going off on holidays. They are unlikely to get much comfort from their deliberations but at least they will have a fair idea where they stand before heading for the beaches. The real problem from now on is that cuts in public spending will bite into services for some of the most vulnerable people in society. The protest outside Leinster House on Wednesday by disability groups already affected by cuts was probably a mild foretaste of what is to come. The introduction of a property tax might have enabled the Government to avoid some of the deeper cuts but both Coalition parties now appear to have backed away from the idea. The Opposition parties had already lined up to oppose a property tax so it looks as if the political system won t be able to deal with the issue this year at least. Personalities will be every bit as important as policy issues in determining how long the Coalition lasts and what will happen in the next election. The leaders of the three main parties have been in the spotlight in recent weeks for very different reasons. The low standing of Taoiseach Brian Cowen in the opinion polls is a worry for Fianna Fáil TDs but there was barely a ripple of dissent when the issue was raised at the parliamentary party meeting last Tuesday. Only his long-term critics, John McGuinness and Noel O Flynn, had anything negative to say about their leader and only three other TDs contributed to the debate. Within Fianna Fáil there is huge sympathy for Cowen s plight and his TDs recognise that whoever was leading the party in the current circumstances would have had a huge battle to retain public support. Nonetheless, many TDs are gripped by a gnawing anxiety that the Taoiseach s negative public image will have disastrous consequences at the next election. Those worries are not voiced at the parliamentary party meetings out of loyalty to the Taoiseach and also because no alternative leader has emerged. Cowen told his party that his leadership was not probationary and he intended to lead on into the next election. In the absence of a challenger that will happen. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny did face a challenge and the manner in which he fought his ground may even work to his long-term advantage. He showed the public hidden qualities but he needs to build on that to convince a significant segment of the electorate that he has what it takes to be taoiseach in these difficult times. The appointment of Michael Noonan as finance spokesman, in place of the more cerebral Richard Bruton, may give the party a sharper edge and his re-emergence in the front rank of politics will be watched keenly. A core of Kenny s opponents within Fine Gael has not been quelled and could even resume plotting against him if the party s poll ratings begin to slip in the autumn. Another heave would appear to be suicidal but politics is not always a rational business. One of the reasons for the continuing unease in Fine Gael has been the rise of Labour in the polls. Much of this is down to the position Eamon Gilmore has been able to carve out for himself as the most popular party leader in the country. That has enabled him to make a realistic pitch to be considered as a candidate for the taoiseach s office. It was the Labour surge in the last Irish Times poll that prompted the heave against Kenny and Fine Gael will continue to look anxiously over its shoulder at the performance of its potential partner. Fianna Fáil will look even more anxiously at the threat Labour poses to its seats countrywide. Labour has been stung by the fact that the media has given wide currency to Government claims that it has not offered any realistic policy alternatives. However, its refusal to commit on the Croke Park deal and the decision to oppose the ban on stag hunting, which Labour has long advocated, has allowed its opponents to claim that it is engaged in purely populist politics. Whatever it is doing, Labour is connecting with the voters, and one of the intriguing battles in the autumn will be the tussle with Fine Gael for the position of the biggest party in the polls. The dynamic between the Opposition rivals could be every bit as unpredictable as that between the parties in Government.",0,,elections,,,,
1327,Irish Independent,11/10/2016,The yo-yo approach gets yet another airing on Budget Groundhog Day,"WE pretty much know what's going to be unveiled in the Dáil today. God, do we know. Irish Budget speeches can be broadly divided into two categories: good times speeches and bad times speeches. There's really no inbetween. For the good times (see, for example, 1977-1980 and 1996-2007), it's across-the-board spending increases and tax cuts like there's no tomorrow. For the bad times (eg 1973-76, 1982-1989 and 2008-2014), it's ... well, the reverse: acrossthe-board spending cuts and tax increases, because without them there may be no tomorrow. Happily, today's speech falls into the former category (tax cuts and spending increases). But the history of the past 50 years tells us it's only a matter of time before we're back into the latter grouping. Yet, somehow, we never seem to grasp the link between our ongoing boom-and-bust cycle and our yo-yo approach to Budgets. You can be sure that the budgetary policy of Germany - a bastion of economic stability - doesn't swing so wildly between extremes. Does Germany halve its Capital Gains Tax rate to 20pc one year and then a few years later bring it back to 33pc? Or raise government spending by double digit percentages for years, resulting in a double digit percentage budget deficit when the wheels come off? Of course it doesn't. And that just might be why it is that bastion of economic stability. You'd imagine we would have learned the lessons from the economic and financial crash, given how painful it was for everybody. Yet here we are, barely out of the woods, and already the promises about tax cuts, taking people out of the tax net, pension increases, more public servants and, most incredibly, first-time buyers' grants, are in full flow. What was it Einstein supposedly said about the definition of insanity being doing the same thing over and expecting different results? And that makes this year's great budgetary give-away - ""we promised you a billion euros, but we're gonna raise that to (EURO)1.2bn"" - all the more depressing. Back in 2009/2010, some of us at least drew small consolation from a (misguided and naive) belief that the crisis represented a chance to start doing things right in this country: reform, common sense policies, the loss of power of vested interests, etc. Yet here we are in Budget Groundhog Day once again. It's arguably worse this time. Not just because we should now know better. But because we're fully aware of the potentially catastrophic fall-out from Brexit. Yet despite that, here we are again with a Government planning to spend money that it can't say with certainty it'll still have to spend in three or four years' time. Sure, we're at the top of the upswing. But it's still yo-yo economics. Imagine it were different. Imagine we had learned the lessons of the noughties and decided to take account of potential dangers that lie ahead. In that scenario, Michael Noonan's speech today might sound something like this: ""A Cheann Comhairle, I stand before the house today with our country at a crossroads. Notwithstanding the massive strides we have made (cue positive news about falling debt, balanced budgets, drops in unemployment), we are facing into hugely uncertain times. The decision of our closest ally and biggest trading partner to leave the EU has enormous implications for Ireland. Suffice to say that, as the only state in Europe with a land border with the UK, the challenges we face from a British exit from the EU are unique. ""Anticipating the precise nature of the fall-out from Brexit is impossible. So much is dependent on factors outside our control. That is why we must proceed with the utmost caution. ""A decade ago or more, the government of the day ignored warning signs that problems might be afoot and introduced a succession of expansionary budgets. I would be failing in my duties as Finance Minister were I now to risk repeating that folly. ""Our best estimation is that the downside from Brexit will be manageable for this economy. However, until we are in a position to fully assess the nature of Britain's exit from the EU, the implications for its economy, for Sterling, for the single market and, crucially, for the border that divides the north and south of this island, it is wise to proceed cautiously. ""For this reason, I am proposing to the house that this year's Budget will be largely neutral - no tax cuts or spending increases beyond upholding the existing level of services. ""And we will maintain that approach until we know the full implications of Brexit on our economy and we can be certain that any 'fiscal space' is sustainable. A Cheann Comhairle, I commend this (non) Budget to the house"". What would the reaction be to such a speech? There would be hell to pay on the floor of the Dáil. Various vested interests would go berserk. It would probably cause an election. But it might also hugely appeal to a large chunk of voters. Those voters who don't have short memories and who are rightly cynical about auction politics and where it'll take us. It might even prove to be an electoral masterstroke. But, much more important than the politics of it, it would be the right thing to do. For the first time arguably ever, a government would be taking difficult decisions before a crisis hit, as opposed to after it - when we always take them. Imagine a government actually saying: ""I won't spend money because I think there's a chance, due to Brexit, that we'll have to take that money back again in the next few years. Governments here have done that too often in the past and we owe it to the Irish people not to keep repeating that mistake."" Now that really would be 'new politics'. Sadly, there's not the remotest possibility of it happening. Get ready for one more spin of the yo-yo. Shane Coleman presents 'Newstalk Breakfast' on weekdays from 7am",0,,,,,,
641,The Irish Times,04/04/2016,Goodbody warns of risk in failure to form government; Stockbroker says political uncertainty could jeopardise economic recovery,"The failure of  political parties to form a government could jeopardise the economic recovery, stockbroking firm Goodbody has warned. It comes as small business group Isme said the ""developing circus"" over the formation of the next government and trade union wage demands were having ""a major negative effect"" on business confidence and expectations. The government policy vacuum, combined with record-low levels of public investment, could soon threaten the recovery if political uncertainty continues, an economic report by Goodbody says. ""A vacuum exists when important policy initiatives in the areas of housing, infrastructure and health need to be addressed,"" said Goodbody chief economist Dermot O'Leary.  Consumer spending  Despite rising international risks led by the potential exit of the UK from the European Union, ""stellar"" Irish growth is expected to continue this year, with consumer spending in the first quarter likely to be higher than it was at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The political stalemate has had little impact on the economy to date. However, ""lingering potential uncertainty has the potential to impact ongoing economic expansion"", according to Mr O'Leary. He suggests that a minority government led by Fine Gael is more likely than a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil coalition, but that regardless of the outcome, ""any radical shift away from the policies of recent years is highly unlikely"". Mr O'Leary calls for a renewed focus on capital spending, ""which . . . will remain worryingly low over the coming years"". The economist also recommends tweaks to the Central Bank mortgage-lending rules introduced last year. The rules, which introduced higher deposit requirements, should be adjusted to recognise both the stage of the housing cycle and geographical differences in markets, he said. Although the measures have been successful to date in their bid to prevent another bubble in prices, they have also had some unintended consequences such as upward pressure on rents and a ""disporprotionate effect on higher-priced markets, particularly in the capital"". Higher rents, though only partly the result of the new rules, had ""heaped"" further pressure on social housing and also increased the prevalence of homelessness, Mr O'Leary writes. Separately, a new MyHome.ie report by Davy Research chief economist Conall Mac Coille outlines the extent to which the impact of the tighter lending rules have been mainly felt in Dublin and commuter belt areas. The housing supply in Dublin may tighten further, as the ""ambitious"" homebuilding goals set under the last government's Construction 2020 strategy is unlikely to be reached with no new stable coalition yet formed, the report notes.  Expectations  Meanwhile, small business group Isme said the ""developing circus"" over the formation of the next government and trade union wage demands were having ""a major negative effect"" on business confidence and expectations.  Isme's latest quarterly business trends survey finds that sentiment among SME owners has slipped this year following a gradual improvement last year. The mood among manufacturing firms was described as ""very worrying"" by the group. ""Increasing business costs, the continuing difficulties in accessing bank finance and scaremongering over Brexit have added to the external factors of threats of euro zone deflation and adverse currency movements,"" said Isme chief executive Mark Fielding. ""The current impasse in the election of a new government and the threatening industrial relations climate is having a major negative effect on SME sentiment. The lack of confidence to govern, shown by all parties in the new Dáil, is a disgrace,"" he said. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan conceded last month that the acting government may miss its deadline to submit its spring economic statement to the European Commission.",1,political,,,,,ireland
990,The Irish Times,21/11/2015,Only certainty about general election is nothing is certain,"As the election inches closer, the conundrum of how the next government is going to be put together assumes ever greater significance. That uncertainty is something that could have a bearing on the outcome of the election itself. The declaration by Fianna Fáil director of elections Billy Kelleher this week that his party would not go into coalition with Fine Gael or Sinn Féin and would not support a Fine Gael-led minority government from the outside highlighted the potential dilemma facing the political system. Of course, a crisis will be avoided if the outgoing Government retains its Dáil majority, but a succession of opinion polls indicates such an outcome is unlikely. It is important to remember, though, that polls between elections are not necessarily a guide to the outcome. The example of what happened in the UK in recent years provides a salutary example. For most of the period between the British elections of 2010 and 2015, the Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives. The gap narrowed as the campaign drew closer and during the campaign itself they were neck and neck. A hung parliament was regarded as the inevitable outcome and senior civil servants prepared for it. In the event the Conservative government confounded expectations by winning a slim but workable majority and it was Labour that was plunged into chaos.  Stability versus chaos  Something similar could happen here if enough voters take to heart the Coalition's message of stability versus chaos. However, given our system of proportional representation, it is hard to see Fine Gael and Labour getting the 80 seats required for a majority in the 158-member Dáil. One of the strongest arguments the Coalition parties have is that they are the only ones offering the voters a government. Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin have said they will not go into coalition unless they are the biggest party. Given that the Fine Gael will almost certainly have more seats than Fianna Fáil and that it in turn will have more seats than Sinn Féin, it means a Fine Gael/ Fianna Fáil coalition or a Fianna Fáil/Sinn Féin coalition has effectively been ruled out. So what do the options look like at this stage? The most likely result - and it is by no means certain - is Fine Gael and Labour will have about 70 seats between them. If they have slightly more than 70, they should be able to put together a deal with a few Independents such as Michael Lowry, Michael Healy-Rae, Noel Grealish and Denis Naughten who left Fine Gael over the Roscommon hospital issue. All four of these TDs voted for Enda Kenny for taoiseach in 2011 so would probably have no objection to doing so again if they got a deal that suited their individual needs and convinced the Government had the capacity to last. In that situation, some other Independents might also try to clamber on board. However, if the Coalition fails to hit the 70-seat mark and needs the support of 10 or 12 TDs from outside its ranks, the situation could get very messy. The uncertainty involved in including so many disparate individuals or groups would make the formation of a stable government unlikely. The fun will really start if nobody can assemble the numbers required to be elected taoiseach when the Dáil resumes after the election. If, as happened once before in 1989, Enda Kenny and the other party leaders are proposed and defeated in the vote for taoiseach, all sorts of options become possible. The assumption is that Fianna Fáil would have to step into the breach and offer to keep the current Coalition in power either through the formation of a grand coalition or by backing it from outside. There are big downsides to either proposition from a Fianna Fáil point of view. Participating as a junior party in a coalition could mark the end of the party's ambitions to recover its status as the biggest party in the country. Supporting a Fine Gael-led government from the outside might even be worse, as it would have responsibility without power. It can also be argued that the national interest would not be served by leaving the Opposition side of the Dáil entirely to Sinn Féin, the hard left and a variety of others.  Depending on the figures, Fianna Fáil's other option could be to attempt to take power with the tacit support of all the anti-Fine Gael elements in the Dáil. The current situation in our fellow bailout country, Portugal, is an example of what can happen. The outgoing centre-right government of Pedro Passos Coelho, which turned the country's economy around, emerged as the biggest force in parliament after the recent general election but failed to win an overall majority.  Economic recovery  The assumption was that the mainstream opposition Socialist Party, which was in government in the early stages of the financial crisis, would do some deal with the government to continue implementing the policies agreed with the EU authorities. Instead the Socialists have done a deal with the Communists and a Syriza-like party, both of whom reject the kind of policies that underpin the economic recovery. The Socialists appear to be on the point of assuming power with the support of the radical left. It is unlikely Fianna Fáil would try something similar here or that Sinn Féin and the hard left would go along with it, but if the Dáil fails to elect a taoiseach first time around, nothing can be ruled out.",1,political,economic recovery,,,,ireland
787,Irish Independent,21/02/2020,Ires Reit stays wary of political shocks as rental income soars,"POLITICAL risk is set to become a major factor in Ires Reit's ability to grow its portfolio value and earnings, analysts warned as the country's biggest private sector landlord reported results yesterday. Ires reported net rental income of (EURO)50.5m for last year, a 23pc increase on 2018 mainly as a result of additional properties. It bought 987 residential units last year, including built stock and forward purchase contracts. Profit for the period fell to (EURO)86.3m from (EURO)119.8m in 2018, on the back of a lower revaluation gain on the portfolio last year. Ires now has a portfolio of almost 3,000 homes, mainly in Dublin. Its blocks range from the super high-end Marker apartments at Grand Canal Square in the Dublin docks, and the Elmpark development, close to St Vincent's Hospital and RTÉ in Dublin 4, to modern developments in Tallaght, Finglas and Inchicore. Average rent last year was (EURO)1,600 per unit, per month, down slightly on 2018. However, on a like-for-like basis, Ires saw 3.1pc rental growth on accommodation it owned prior to 2019, with rents in these properties increasing to (EURO)1,650 a month. CEO Margaret Sweeney, said that despite continued improvement in house building in Ireland during 2019, there is a ""significant"" shortage of accommodation. ""Supply remains limited due to a lack of construction,"" Ms Sweeney said. ""This macro environment, coupled with our continued investment and professional property management, provides significant opportunities for Ires to continue to grow as a leading provider of private rented residential homes in Ireland."" However, the shift to left wing parties in this month's general election and the huge focus on rents during the campaign mean more stringent rent controls are increasingly likely, Goodbody's head of real estate Colm Lauder noted. That would impact IRES' ability to grow NAV and earnings. A tougher rent regime for landlords would hit Ires ability to lift existing rents in line with the current market. Ires itself acknowledged ""there is increased uncertainty in relation to future Government policy on housing and regulation of the private rental market, particularly in relation to rent regulation"". Ires noted this uncertainty is likely to continue ""for some months"" until there is clarity on Government formation. Shares in Ires were trading up around 1.2pc yesterday, which Mr Lauder said ""reflects the lingering political risk in the Irish residential market"". Ires boasted a staggering 98.3pc occupancy rate across its units, meaning that none of its units are vacant for any real amount of time. In addition, it benefits from economies of scale on property management and maintenance. Graphic   Ires CEO Margaret Sweeney",1,regulation,election coalition,,,,ireland
866,Irish Independent,30/03/2015,"Live Register, tax receipts and Greek reforms to top agenda","IT has become somewhat repetitive to say the coming days are make or break for Greece. How many occasions since the start of the year could we have used this phrase in relation to the country? But it is true to say that this week is important for the Greek government. It announced last Friday that it had sent its creditors a long-awaited list of reforms with a pledge to produce a small budget surplus this year in the hope that it will unlock badlyneeded cash. Officials were said to be examining the proposals over the weekend, and their approval, followed by the blessing of eurozone finance ministers, will be needed for Athens to unfreeze further aid and stave off bankruptcy. The Greek government has not indicated whether the latest list will contain a more far-reaching reform programme than a previous list of seven reforms on broad issues ranging from tax evasion to public sector reforms, which failed to impress lenders. With the start of the new month upon us in the middle of the week, the domestic business news agenda at this point is dominated by various economic updates, despite Easter closing the week. These include Exchequer returns for April, due out on Thursday, which will give a broad picture of the tax and spending picture of the first quarter of the year, and, presumably, continue to show that Finance Minister Michael Noonan will have some scope for a pre-election expansionary Budget later in the year. The rapidly-improving economy has helped push tax receipts ahead of expectations and the belief is for a continuation of that trend. Alan McQuaid of Merrion Stockbrokers estimates that tax receipts are expected to be around (EURO)400m ahead of profile. ""An Exchequer deficit of circa (EURO)800m is expected, down from a deficit of (EURO)2,316m in the same period last year,"" he said. The Central Bank will also give its latest assessment of the economy this week, when it publishes its latest quarterly economic bulletin on Wednesday morning. Expectations are that Dame Street will revise up its growth forecasts. Indeed, the Government next month is due to publish its spring statement, which will also contain updated predictions for economic growth. Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan will be on the M1 northbound tomorrow as he is due to deliver a speech at Queen's University in Belfast. The thrust of the speech sounds both interesting and topical as it centres on currency issues. Other important economic news includes both the Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing, due out on Wednesday, and the Services PMI, due on Good Friday. Mr McQuaid expects the manufacturing PMI Index to have hit 58 last month. Anything above 50 signals expansion, and below that contraction. Activity in the country's manufacturing sector rebounded in February to a 15-year high after a relatively weak January as strong new orders helped boost employment in the sector. Manufacturing data will also be published for some of the world's major economies, including the US, UK and China. We'll get the latest update on unemployment on Wednesday, when the Central Statistics Office publishes the Live Register. The seasonally-adjusted Live Register fell 4,300 in the month to 355,600 in February, its lowest total since February 2009. The Live Register has been falling for more than two and a half years and we're expecting that trend to have continued last month. Elsewhere, tomorrow, European Central Bank supervisory board chair Daniele Nouy testifies to the European Parliament as the Single Supervisory Mechanism publishes its first annual report. And while it's a political diary note, you can bet that investors will be keeping a close eye on the UK election debate due to take place on Thursday. Prime minister David Cameron will be taking part in the only full-scale party leaders' debate on television ahead of the May election, with seven party chiefs answering questions. The outcome of the election will likely determine whether or not the UK will hold a referendum on whether to pull out of the European Union. And that's a prospect that will quite likely spook investors, who dislike uncertainty.",0,,Rent,,,,
874,The Irish Times,06/11/2015,Looming election will trigger market focus on Irish economic policy; Backdrop for election is perceived in markets to be more benign than was the case even a few months ago,"Ireland is set to come under renewed scrutiny in financial markets whenever Taoiseach Enda Kenny calls the general election. At issue for international investors is whether the next administration maintains the thrust of policies which have finally spurred growth after years of turmoil.  This is no small question. Ireland's high national debt and high dependence on foreign direct investment mean external confidence is crucial. The eyes of the financial markets are not trained on Dublin right now, that is clear. But the inevitability of the election - early in the new year, most likely - means attention will turn to Ireland soon enough.  ""Generally speaking the market dislikes elections. The mere fact that there is an election is like opening the Pandora's box for investors, and smaller countries are particularly more susceptible,"" says Michael Michaelides, European rates strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland in London. Still, the backdrop for the election is perceived in markets to be a good deal more benign than was the case even a few months ago.  For one thing, reluctant acceptance of the third Greek bailout package by the radical-left Syriza government has blunted the force of anti-establishment rhetoric from its would-be bedfellows in Ireland and other crisis-struck countries such as Spain.  For another, the expectation of a new round of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank underpins confidence that funding conditions in euro zone sovereign bond markets will remain positive for some time to come.  This is crucial. Market participants note with some caution that EUR 1.5 billion in supplementary spending this year meant the budget for 2016 is a lot larger than foreseen. However, they say the expectation of more quantitative easing from the ECB means there is less market focus on the the ""looser"" stance in the budget.  ""People paid the Italian government to take their money last week. The pricing of these risks has been significantly muted,"" says a US-based investor in Irish debt.  All of this comes on top of speedy economic growth in Ireland, a big rise in tax revenues, solid progress to rein in the budget deficit and a declining debt ratio vis-a-vis gross domestic product. That is for the good, no doubt, but will it continue after the election? In summary, investors believe it will.  Semi-core market segment  Notwithstanding big ECB interventions, low Irish borrowing costs indicate that the State's bonds are increasingly priced in the ""semi-core"" segment of the euro zone market alongside the likes of Belgium. That hardly suggests investor disquiet over the outlook for the election.  But market chatter persists around the rise of Sinn Féin, the hard left and Independents. The perception of Sinn Féin is that it is not investor friendly, likewise the hard left. Neither is likely to be in government after the election, but questions are raised in the international setting as to whether the advance of such parties would lead to a hung Dáil.  ""I don't know if there's a huge amount of focus on it right how but I've heard sporadic debate that Sinn Féin is extremely popular,"" says the US-based investor, echoing the observations of other market participants.  ""I don't think a Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil government or the return of Fine Gael/ Labour would be news. It's something that would keep the sovereign on the same road map it's been on for the last four or five years. I don't know if the market would differentiate between a FG/FF coalition or a FG/Lab coalition.""  Given that the Irish election is preceded by votes this year in Greece, Portugal and a looming poll in Spain, other observers concur that Ireland is not in immediate focus. But the outcome of the Portuguese election is seen to be salutary. Centre-right prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho won the most seats but not a majority, prompting ongoing efforts by opposition Socialists to form unlikely alliance with communists and another leftist party to topple his minority government.  ""There were more interesting elections beforehand,"" says Michaelides of RBS. ""For that reason Ireland is less in focus - funding needs are coming down, it's converting to semi-core - it doesn't seem interesting. The reason it might be slightly more interesting is what happened in Portugal. ""After Portugal there's heightened awareness. No one has really asked who could combine with who in the Irish setting, and who are these Independents.  ""I expect that sort of question to come more into focus, particularly when the election is called. No one is focused on it right now.""  Political concerns  But the election countdown is on. Citing the evolution this year of borrowing costs in Greece, Spain and Portugal, a Dublin- based trader says ""political concerns"" have been a major driver of relative government bond yields.  ""Ahead of the Spanish regional elections held on September 27th, Spanish bonds underperformed their peers on fears of a pro-independence Catalan support,"" the trader says. ""There was less concern from investors leading into the Portuguese elections on October 4th as polls suggested a centrist coalition would be the result. However, since the three parties making up the left alliance attempted to form a rival government in the aftermath, risk premium has increased."" This person notes that Irish bonds have performed ""weakly"" in recent times, with the yield on 10-year paper widening by eight basis points versus equivalent French bonds in the past two months.  Although European Central Bank president Mario Draghi set off a rally in euro zone debt when he signalled an expansion of the quantitative easing programme a fortnight ago, the impact on Irish bond yields was negligible.  The trader attributes this to uncertainty over the election.  Michaelides of RBS is not inclined to agree with that assessment. ""I would say it's premature to say Ireland is not holding up because of the election,"" he says. But he also argues that the timing of the election in the first quarter of next year may not be helpful, particularly if the ECB actually moves ahead with another dose of quantitative easing.  ""Ireland may not benefit as strongly from early-year flows as it would have done if the election had already passed, particularly given that quarter one tends to be most active period for most asset managers.""  Further questions surround the stance of credit rating agencies in relation to Irish debt, although market participants say that is less important these days than in the past.  At issue here is the stance of Moody's, which stands apart from rivals Standard & Poor's and Fitch by not having an A rating on Irish debt.  Thus the fiscal policy of the next administration will be crucial. ""From our perspective we want to form a view on fiscal policy further, what that means for public debt and debt trends and how the economy performs,"" says Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice-president at Moody's.  ""Anything that gives comfort that rapid fiscal consolidation will continue would be welcome. We don't give recommendations but our view is that the faster you reduce the deficit, the faster the debt ratio comes down.""  Uncertainty  Muehlbronner notes inevitable uncertainty around the election. ""Clearly we have seen in a number of European or euro zone countries that elections this time around have produced some surprises. I wouldn't say it's a huge uncertainty or huge risk factor, but there's bigger uncertainty than in the past. That doesn't only apply to Ireland.""  This brings us to the question of political stability, a mantra for Coalition parties as they gear up for the election. ""Political stability is always better than political instability, that's nothing peculiar to Ireland,"" says Muehlbronner.  ""It's probably more a question of having a majority government, having a stable majority, that the next government can settle on whatever the policies are, and you don't have a long period of forming the next government.""  Gergely Kiss, a London-based director in the sovereign group at Fitch ratings agency, says Europe's new fiscal rules present a key test to the next administration.  ""Any new Irish government will really need to remain compliant with the fiscal rules. Our baseline assumption is they remain compliant. The higher transparency built into the fiscal rules means that we will see early if a government is not compliant with fiscal rules,"" he says. ""There is really a credibility earned through the consolidation period. Ireland really stands out a country which always delivered, or overachieved its fiscal targets. It makes a comfortable starting position that you have this credibility."" ",1,monetary,,,,,ireland
627,The Irish Times,01/04/2021,Gap growing in two-tier Irish economy,"If the Central Bank's latest quarterly bulletin highlights one thing, it is the two-tier nature of the Irish economy.  The regulator expects up to 100,000 people to permanently lose their jobs as a result of the pandemic and the current lockdown measures. Low-paid workers in consumer-facing sectors of the economy - hospitality, retail - are the principal economic victims of this crisis.  They are victims not just of the pandemic, but of the increased level of digitalisation that it has ushered in. Many of the firms or sectors they work in are gradually becoming obsolete or will operate more online with fewer staff going forward.  At the same time, the Central Bank is expecting recovery in the second half of 2021 to be aided by the unwinding of up to EUR 15.7 billion in savings, built up over the past year by households that have been financially unaffected, even boosted, by the pandemic. The average earnings of those who didn't lose their jobs in the pandemic rose by 4-5 per cent last year. Pent-up consumer spending combined with multinational exports is expected to see the Irish economy grow by nearly 6 per cent this year. The Central Bank's report underscores the fact that we now have two distinct economies. One is uber-rich and driving forward, the other is lagging further and further behind. The former, led by the world's leading pharma and tech giants, is seemingly coronavirus-resistant, the other is limping and injured and facing an uncertain future.  While Ireland has had one of the most severe and extended lockdowns in Europe, the wages of a great many workers have been unaffected and their fortunes boosted. At the same time, up to 100,000 workers are facing into long-term unemployment. The gap between these two economies is going to play out politically as well as economically in the years to come.",0,,financial markets,,,,
1127,The Irish Times,08/03/2004,Revitalising the FF faithful,"Fianna Fail activists rallied to support the party at the weekend and, as more than 800 local authority and European Parliament candidates for the June elections strutted their stuff at the ardfheis, the occasion became a confident celebration, rather than a worrisome preparation. It was only when key officials faced hard questions about possible seat losses that uncertainty showed through. For, on the basis of the party's consistent showing in the opinion polls and constituency changes, the election results are likely to disappoint. Such an eventuality was happily ignored by delegates, however, as they applauded the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, and basked in the comfort of being seven years in government. 04030800084 The proceedings were even more carefully orchestrated than usual. No policy-making motions were discussed. No dissent was tolerated. And no votes were taken. Instead, Ministers were politely requested to outline the Government's position on a variety of issues and delegates listened, asked questions and applauded. For all of that, the atmosphere at the ardfheis was confident. For the first time, local elections would be held without the direct involvement of Oireachtas members. And candidates were hopeful that this new division of responsibility would insulate them against the residual anger of voters over broken promises in the general election. The Government had provided them with a number of popular issues on which to campaign. There was the plan to send more than 10,000 civil and public servants to 53 different locations outside Dublin. There was the announcement that hundreds of schools would be refurbished this summer. And there was the relaxation of planning regulations for once-off housing in rural areas. The focus on council and European elections was not absolute. In his televised address, the Taoiseach emphasised the Government's effective handling of the economy. They were investing in education, health, pensions and infrastructure, he said, and were working to create a knowledge-based economy. By the time the general election came around, in 2007, they would have substantially completed motorways to Belfast, Galway and Cork. On Northern Ireland, Mr Ahern insisted there could be no half-way house between democracy and violence. There had to be an absolute commitment by republicans to end all paramilitary activity. At the same time, unionists had to sign up to partnership and help to put an end to loyalist violence. Evidence from Mr Tom Gilmartin at the Mahon tribunal about corruption in the planning process was expected to cast a shadow over the proceedings, but it was shrugged off. And, following a commitment in the Taoiseach's opening address on Friday to 24-hour medical cover, reform of hospital services under the Hanly report was entirely omitted from Mr Ahern's keynote speech. The issue was just too dangerous. The ardfheis was all about revitalising the party machine and appealing to rural voters.",0,,,,,,
473,The Irish Times,10/04/1998,"EMU partners are watching our Budget policyWith fewer policy options available and an uncertain economic vista opening up, a more sophisticated approach to the 1999 Budget is needed","Much attention in recent weeks has focused on the setting of the pound's entry rate to monetary union and on the prospects for interest rates in the months ahead. But there have also been some important pointers on Budget policy. Put bluntly, our EU partners are concerned at us running an expansionary budget policy and the implications this might have for inflation. In the communique following the revaluation, it was clearly ""noted"" that Ireland had promised to direct any extra tax revenue this year to cutting debt, rather than increasing spending, while the main goal of the 1999 Budget is to be controlling inflation. 98041000167 What the commitment for next year actually means, of course, is an open question, but it is a clear marker of how our Budget policy is now being closely watched by our prospective monetary union partners. Meanwhile, at home the Central Bank is warning darkly of the need to tighten up on budgetary policy to provide a few extra bob in the Exchequer's back pocket as we enter the euro-zone. Once we enter monetary union, we will abandon control of interest rates and our exchange rate will not be able to move independently. Thus we will lose - in fact have pretty much already lost - the power to move interest rates or to try to influence the pound's exchange rate, as tools of economic management. So if the two traditional tools of monetary policy management are abandoned, will the Budget become the main method for the Government in trying to affect the overall level of economic activity? Budget policy will certainly assume a new importance. And as the Central Bank pointed out in its recent report to the Government on Ireland in monetary union, it makes sense for the Exchequer to run a sizeable surplus in times of strong economic growth, to allow some leeway on the Budget in times of slower growth. After all, under the stability pact which governs policy inside monetary union, we are obliged to balance our annual Budget over the course of the economic cycle. However, we need to be careful when assessing the extent to which governments will be able to use Budgets to ""manage"" the economy. The old Keynesian idea was that spending should increase and taxes be cut when the economy slows and vice versa, in an attempt to smooth the economy cycle. Whether such a policy could ever work in a small, open economy like Ireland was doubtful. In any case, we never tried it. Back in the late 1980s spending was cut at a time when the economy was in a particularly bad shape. In more recent years, Budget policy has followed a predictable course. The spending departments try to get as much cash as possible - and have succeeded in getting rises many times the rate of inflation - and whatever is left is given out by the Minister of the day in tax cuts. The rapid rate of economic growth has allowed recent Ministers to perform the neat three-card trick of increasing spending, cutting taxes and keeping a respectable gloss on the overall Exchequer finances. Inside EMU we should take a more strategic view of Budget policy, as the Central Bank suggests. It would make sense to have room to use specific tax or spending measures to address any difficulties which might hit us inside monetary union. And we do not want to be in a position where a sharp slowdown in growth would leave us heavily in deficit and lead to pressures from Europe to cut spending or increase taxes to help bring the books back closer to balance and comply with the stability pact. But we should not think that we can start to use the Budget to manage the overall level of economic activity, now that we no longer have interest rates to play around with. The economy is too open to outside influence to make such a policy easy to work and, in any case, the scale of changes in taxes and spending necessary to influence the economy significantly would not be politically possible. For example, economist Austin Hughes of Irish Intercontinental Bank estimates in a note this week that the Government would have to take (pounds) 1.5 billion out of the economy, through hiking taxes or reducing spending, in order to slow economic growth from its current 8 or 9 per cent to around 4 to 5 per cent. Budgetary change on this scale would simply not be politically possible. Budgets will also change in another way. Increasingly, the Government will come under pressure to use specific tax and spending measures to address key economic problems. For example, a couple of years ago the policy response to the surge in house prices would have been a sharp rise in interest rates. With the interest rate weapon now disarmed, the Government will consider recommendations in a report from economic consultant Peter Bacon which are likely to include addressing the problem in part through changes in certain tax measures, and possible alterations in grants to home-buyers. Dr Bacon will also, no doubt, recommend other measures in the area of regulations influencing the supply of land and its use, illustrating that the pressure for new policy approaches to address key problems will go beyond Budgetary measures. Also, as business competes across the euro-zone, pressure will come on the Government to introduce Budget measures to underpin competitiveness and help build up profit margins to cope if something goes wrong - such as a collapse in the value of sterling. Crucially, budgets will also have to offer enough in tax reductions to maintain low nominal wage increases and keep a lid on wage inflation. With much fewer policy options available and a new and uncertain economic vista opening up, a much more sophisticated approach to Budgetary policy will be needed. It should start with the 1999 Budget, on which preparations will soon commence.",0,,,,,,
342,Irish Independent,12/10/2013,"Crash, bang, wallop!; Can Enda and Eamon's double act survive? Kim Bielenberg reports on a troubled partnership","Enda Kenny was up early on Sunday morning, and off to attend a football match. As he said himself, he had taken a wallop in the Seanad referendum. Now, like the vanquished Mayo team after the All-Ireland, he was dusting himself off. His close political adviser, Ger Deere, said: ""It was business as usual on Sunday. He rang me at 7am on the following morning, and attended to a few things in the constituency, and then it was time for the hard work before the Budget. ""Enda will put the defeat behind him,"" he added. ""You have to remember the setbacks he has had before in a 40-year career. He has taken a few knocks. Eleven years ago he almost lost his seat."" The Taoiseach was accused of blundering into the Seanad poll, avoiding debate and even a certain uncharacteristic arrogance. But suggestions that Fine Gael knives are out for him may be wide of the mark. The political circus has already moved on. By the time Budget highwire acts and the Leinster House clowning are over next week, the unhappy memories of the Seanad poll will fade. On Wednesday, he was lucky to have political stardust falling on his shoulder when Bill Clinton came to Ireland, and dropped in to see the Taoiseach. According to Pat Leahy's account of the present government, The Price of Power, Labour ministers are said to look on enviously at Enda's ability to maintain a sunny demeanour while they grapple gloomily with cuts and the inevitable crises that come along. As one minister remarked ruefully of the perennially breezy Taoiseach, ""How the f*** does he do it?"" The political outlook for the Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore is much more problematic, and he is fighting for his political life. The Seanad referendum was not Gilmore's baby, but the most recent opinion poll shows that he could be facing political oblivion. Labour could only achieve 6pc in the most recent Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll, its lowest ranking for a quarter of a century. ""If the party gets that in a general election, Gilmore is gone,"" said Adrian Kavanagh, lecturer in political geography at NUI Maynooth. ""He would definitely lose his seat, and Labour might have just one or two TDs. ""Even if his party is on 10pc, his seat will be in grave danger."" Dr Kavanagh said there were signs from the referendum that Enda and Eamon were losing the support of ""breakfast-roll man"". The figure invented by David McWilliams is the hard-working, now cash-strapped voter in the commuter belt in Leinster. ""The area around Dublin has been the key battleground in recent elections. Breakfast-roll man supported Fianna Fáil in the 2007 election and went to Fine Gael and Labour in 2011. They could go back to Fianna Fáil."" There is speculation in political circles that Joan Burton will wait until next year's local elections, when Labour is expected to be decimated, before mounting a challenge. Burton has said in the past few days that the Labour leader has her full support, but such protestations sometimes have the tone of a football club chairman offering his backing to a beleaguered manager. If the losing streak continues, support may be quickly withdrawn. Burton is seen by some in Leinster House as someone who throws shapes, and all but shouts from the rooftops her opposition to Gilmore. But she is not thought to have widespread support among her parliamentary colleagues. It is frequently forgotten also that Joan Burton is six years older than Gilmore at 64. Most of the rest of Labour's old guard are well into their 60s and it helps Gilmore's chances of survival that there is no other obvious successor among the younger members. Some more youthful figures in the party are said to be frustrated at the lack of opportunities for advancement in the party as the veterans cling to power. The government chief whip Paul Kehoe probably over-egged the pudding recently when he claimed Fine Gael and Labour have a ""close and loving relationship"". But few doubt that the cordial relations between Gilmore and Kenny have helped to stop the Government going off the rails. ""The Taoiseach and Tánaiste get on pretty well, partly because they are both West of Ireland men,"" said one government insider. Just as important as the bond between Taoiseach and Tánaiste is the tight-knit inner sanctum of the Government. The four-man Economic Management Council - consisting of Kenny, Gilmore, Finance Minister Michael Noonan, and Public Expenditure Minister Brendan Howlin - has made the key decisions in the run-up to Tuesday's Budget. ""The members of the council seem to get on well,"" said one Fine Gael source. ""It can be very frustrating for ministers who are outside the loop and for government TDs, but it has helped to bring stability."" Both leaders have more fractious relations with some of their own backbenchers. Both have disaffected rumps - groups of TDs who are semidetached, and face uncertain futures within their parties. The group of Labour dissidents is potentially much more damaging to Gilmore as the party suffers more after budget cuts. ""Lucinda Creighton and a breakaway group from Fine Gael might not damage Enda Kenny all that much if they run in an election,"" says Dr Adrian Kavanagh. ""They could be coalition partners for Fine Gael in the same way as the Progressive Democrats were natural partners for Fianna Fáil."" Gilmore has moved smoothly through the corridors of power in Brussels, but many within his own party believe he should be much more engaged on the domestic front. Joanna Tuffy, Labour TD for Dublin Mid West, said: ""A lot of stuff put out by the Government is very high-brow. Eamon Gilmore needs to be out on the ground in the community talking to people. We need to listen to what our core voters are saying. Times are difficult for them, they are struggling and Labour needs to be doing more."" The double act at the heart of government will hope that this week's ESRI forecasts for an economic recovery going into next year amount to more than ill-founded optimism. Half way through their term, Gilmore and Kenny know that it is still all to play for. While the Tánaiste's political future is uncertain, Kenny still has a fighting chance of becoming the first Fine Gael leader to serve two successive terms as Taoiseach. FOCUS ON FOCUS GROUPS Éamon De Valera famously looked into his heart when he was gauging the mood of the Irish people. In the 21st Century, political parties are more likely to call on a focus group. In planning to abolish the Seanad, Enda Kenny is said to have relied heavily on focus group research, which purported to show that the public was in favour of scrapping the second chamber. Fine Gael also sounded out focus groups over the abortion legislation which passed through the Oireachtas earlier this year. Generally, the parties bring together a representative group of up to a dozen people and measure their response to policies and slogans. One former government spindoctor said: ""They are much derided. The main parties use them, particularly at election time, but this time the focus group seemed to say one thing and the electorate another. ""That does not mean that they are not useful. You have to rely on political common sense as well as the messages you are getting from them."" . There were signs from the referendum that Enda and Eamon were losing 'breakfast-roll man' Graphic   Political marriage: Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore's working relationship is feeling the strain from Budget cuts and dissent among party colleagues Tough on Eamon: Joan Burton Happy days: Mr Kenny and former US president Bill Clinton",0,,,,,,
1187,The Irish Times,20/03/2015,Spring statement will force parties to set out their stalls,"The ""spring economic statement"", due soon from the Government, is fast assuming almost totemic status. As Fine Gael and Labour approach the final phase of their mandate, the document will set out their joint fiscal vows for the election to come. But what exactly is going on? And what does it all mean? Although the spring statement has been cast in some quarters as something new and entirely novel, the reality is more subtle. The statement, in essence, will be a dressed-up variant of a formal document the Government is already obliged to produce under European budget rules. By the end of April every year, member states whose deficit and debt are in breach of EU limits are obliged to produce a ""stability programme update"" setting out the progress made (or not) in meeting fiscal targets from the previous October.  Coming as it does at a mid-way point between annual budgets, this is essentially a half-time assessment for examination in Brussels. Member states must also plot future moves to curtail debt and deficits in the update. Ireland's annual update was released as matter of routine every April for years, but without any political fanfare. There was a simple explanation for that: for as long as the document contained bad news in the form of yet more retrenchment to come by way of tax hikes and spending cuts, there was no desire to publicise it.  Two things have now changed. First is the return of growth to the economy, which has changed the parameters of policy debate to the extent that discussion centres on the scope and scale of recovery dividends. Second is the fact that the election looms just over the horizon, presenting an obvious imperative to the parties of the Coalition and, indeed, the Opposition, to set out their economic plans. It is with all this in mind that the Government resolved months ago to expand the stability programme update into something bigger. On the assumption that recovery continues to deepen, the basic objective is to define the fiscal space available in coming years and set out a programme of taxation cuts and expenditure increases. While the whole package will be predicated on the achievement of certain rates of growth over the course of years, the Government's aim will be to set out what it plans to do in the realm of income tax, the universal social charge and a wide assortment of other measures. Capital expenditure plans will be set out a little later. The exercise can be seen, too, as a clear attempt to draw the Opposition parties into detailed debate as to what exactly they would do if they won the election. The Government is certainly unloved, but its election campaign will be fought on the basis that it is best-placed to consolidate the turnaround under way. This will play out against the radicalist onslaught from Sinn FÃ©in and the hard left, and whatever is produced by Fianna FÃ¡il, Renua and all the other contestants.  The spring economic statement, however, must be seen as a concerted Government effort to mould the framework within which the campaign takes place.  Yet uncertainties abound still. Right now the principal doubt centres on the leeway available within EU rules to introduce another expansionary budget next October. True, we've already heard plenty about austerity being at an end. But the Government will be obliged for years to maintain a very tight rein on spending and do more to eliminate what is known as the structural deficit, an estimate of what the actual deficit would be if the economy was at full capacity. Expenditure caps There is some confidence in Coalition circles that highly technical EU assumptions on the calculation of the structural deficit (don't ask) can be reworked to allow a more gradual slide towards a balanced budget.  Yet expenditure caps are perceived as a major problem. This explains demands for European flexibility from Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and TÃ¡naiste Joan Burton.  No matter how that plays out, the spring statement in the final week of April will be the first in a series of co-ordinated initiatives through which the Government will seek to dominate the political agenda right through to the October budget.  The statement will be followed by - in sequence- the marriage equality referendum in May; a capital investment plan in early June; a two-week public economic debate in late June involving all political parties and the social partners; and formal recommendations in July from the Low Pay Commission.

1178,The Irish Times,05/12/2002,Social welfare spending to rise by E530mOld-age pensions are increased by E10 per week but commitments on child benefit cannot be met this year,"Over the last five years, the budgets which I introduced helped to secure the most sustained period of investment and growth in the history of our country. The overriding objective of this Budget is to consolidate those gains which we delivered in recent years and to provide the foundation for future growth. Our policies have ensured the end of the era of mass unemployment and emigration. We implemented a major step-up in the funding of our public services to help them to catch up and develop. We also introduced major tax and social welfare packages to the benefit of all in our society. 02120500221 To those who want to know where the resources generated in recent years have gone, the answer is clear. They are providing more health services, higher pensions, smaller class-sizes and improving the living standards of both tax-payers and social welfare recipients alike. Today's Budget has been framed in very different circumstances from those of previous years. On budget day last year, I published detailed projections for 2003 and 2004 which signalled projected deficits for each of those years. Since then, the situation has become more difficult because of the unexpected continued weakness of the international economy. In exactly the same way as every other government in Europe, we are now faced with clear budgetary pressures. In the past, we in this country chose to ignore the unfavourable economic reality and went ahead with policies we couldn't afford. All that those policies delivered, however, was rising budget deficits and higher unemployment. They provided no solution to our economic problems. There are those who want us to forget the lessons of the past. They want me to announce major spending increases, irrespective of the economic situation. However, my view is that the responsible policy is to take a moderate route and to take the necessary decisions now so that we ensure growth in the medium term. That is why my Budget has been developed within a three-year framework. Budget objectives This Budget has three key objectives: protecting the weaker sections of society; investing in the future, to position ourselves for a return to better growth levels; and securing stable public finances to safeguard the gains we have already made. These are three core objectives to achieve the vision for Irish society which the Government and the social partners share. They are also central to the conclusions reached by the National Economic and Social Council in its recent strategy report. These are sound and achievable goals. They are right in themselves and right for the times we are now facing. They lay the foundations for renewed economic and budgetary progress by setting the fiscal framework for the next three years. They also put in place a framework within which discussions on a successor to the PPF can be based. Social partnership has played a key role in the story of our success so far. The Government is keen that it should continue to play the same role in this more difficult environment. The Government will be fair in determining where the pluses and minuses fall. The aim is to support those areas of critical importance to overall economic and social progress. In the new situation, we also need to be more flexible and innovative in how we generate, allocate and manage resources. Economic Outlook At this time last year, I underlined the unusual degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The pick-up then expected in the major world economies in the second half of 2002 did not happen. As a result, our growth in GNP terms, at an estimated 1.8 per cent this year, has been well below target. As in other countries, the slower than expected growth has had an adverse impact on our budgetary position. The short-term prospects for the international economy are not good. This year's Budget is being presented in the middle of a substantial international economic slowdown. The best that can be expected now is a global upturn in the second half of 2003. Next year, the euro area economy is expected to grow by 1.8 per cent and that of the United States by 2.3 per cent. Ireland is part of a common currency area where average inflation is not far above 2 per cent. We must get our inflation rate down close to that level as soon as possible, otherwise we risk losing out on jobs. We have lost competitiveness in the last few years. Our priority must be to halt this slide and regain our position. Competitiveness creates jobs and wealth, and generates the resources needed to build the sort of society we all want. There are significant downside risks to all economic projections at this time. The difficulties in the Middle East, the continued question marks about a recovery in the information and communication technology sector and possible sharp exchange rate movements are but some of the more obvious ones. Growth in Ireland next year will be modest. The range of commentators' forecasts for 2003 is far narrower than last year, centring around 3 and 4 per cent GDP growth. At this stage my estimate for GDP growth next year is 31/2 per cent, with prospects improving as we move into 2004 and 2005. GNP growth next year is projected at 21/4 per cent. We cannot now expect to be approaching our potential GDP growth rate until sometime in 2004 at the earliest. Employment is expected to grow next year by 11,000, with unemployment at around 51/4 per cent. On the assumption of unchanged interest and exchange rates, and taking account of changes in this Budget, consumer price inflation will be 4.8 per cent and, depending on wage cost factors, should be on a downward trend. If we get our cost base under control, we can expect to see inflation come down significantly by 2005. Full details of the economic projections underlying the Budget are included in the EU Stability Programme Update, published with the Budget today. This update will be assessed by the European Commission in the New Year in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the accounting norms applied by Eurostat, the Commission's statistical agency. Budgetary Projections The 2003 Budgetary targets are subject to the same risks I outlined earlier. These targets are as follows: an increase in gross spending on public services of 5.7 per cent, bringing it to a total of E38,015 million; a current Budget surplus of E3,685 million; a capital Budget deficit of E5,554 million; an Exchequer deficit of E1,869 million, including a release of E250 million from the Capital Services Redemption Account to meet interest costs on the national debt; a general Government deficit of E885 million or 0.7 per cent of GDP; and a debt ratio of 34 per cent of GDP, the second-lowest in the EU. Position in 2004 and 2005 In present circumstances, we have no choice but to move our expenditure, pay and cost levels onto a lower growth trajectory. Even by doing that we are facing the prospect of having to borrow more than E3 billion in 2004 and again in 2005. The position is that in 2004 and 2005 we will face a large and continuing Exchequer borrowing requirement and a general Government deficit of around 1.2 per cent of GDP, which will require us to continue to take the necessary corrective action. Public Service Pay As the House knows, talks on a new national pay agreement and on the implementation of the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body are currently under way. Any such agreement would have to deal with the issues highlighted in the benchmarking body's report, including the need for real change. If there is a new agreement, one cost that will arise is in respect of the first phase increase under benchmarking. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, this would be due to be paid with effect from December 1st, 2001. The cost of this to the end of 2003, including arrears, is E565 million and I am providing for same. There are a number of other pay and pay-related issues which are currently being dealt with in various processes. I do not intend to prejudge the outcome of any of these individual issues, but I consider it sensible to make a global provision of E50 million in respect of the totality of these. The growth in the public service pay bill has to be contained. One factor in achieving this is restraint in relation to the level of pay increases, and the Government is making its position clear in the national pay talks. The other main factor driving the rise in the pay bill is the growth in public service numbers. These have risen by about 50,000 over the last five years. As a first step, the Government has decided that numbers employed across all sectors of the public service are to be capped at their present authorised levels with immediate effect. In addition, the Government has decided that there will be a reduction of 5,000 in those numbers over the next three years. Public spending This Government is committed to spending such public resources as can be made available to provide for the welfare of our people. We have shown that commitment in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. When we had the extra resources, we used them to provide much-needed additional public services, and rightly so. We have achieved a lot in this respect since 1997, as the increase in spending between 1997 and 2003 shows. In that period, total gross spending, capital and current, will have increased from under E19 billion to over E38 billion, an increase of 102 per cent. In that time: total health spending will have risen by E5.2 billion to E8.9 billion; total education spending will have risen by E2.5 billion to E5.6 billion; social welfare spending will have increased by E4.5 billion to E10.2 billion; and spending on infrastructure will have increased by E2 billion to nearly E5.6 billion. The Government is continuing to provide substantial funding in 2003 for these key priority areas. As everyone knows, we must keep our spending consistent with the available resources. There is a limited pool of such resources. This means that we must prioritise, and if one sector receives more, others must receive less. The report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee, which I am publishing today, was of considerable assistance to the Government in prioritising our spending choices for 2003. Ultimately, however, the decisions underpinning the expenditure Estimates were, of course, taken by the Government. The committee highlighted the limitations associated with a one-year focus on expenditure planning. It recommended that a further review of expenditure should be undertaken by my Department immediately after Budget 2003 with a focus on expenditure in 2004 and 2005. I agree fully with this recommendation and my Department will initiate such a review in January 2003. Additional Spending I expect voted public expenditure to come in on, or close to, target in 2002. Including the social welfare package, I am today providing an additional E1.3 billion in gross spending in 2003. Taking account of the spending set out in the Estimates last month, this means that total gross spending on public services next year will be E2 billion above the estimated 2002 outturn, an increase of 5.7 per cent. This means that this Government will since 1997 have more than doubled total gross expenditure on public services to E38,015 million. Public Services Whatever deficiencies exist in relation to the quality and quantity of our public services, money alone is clearly not the answer. There is scope for securing better value for money through more effective control and management of public expenditure. Every euro saved is a euro available to spend on hospital patients, our children's education and our roads. The Government has recently agreed a number of improvements to the financial management systems which will be introduced from the beginning of 2003. Briefly: In order to facilitate a more informed assessment of emerging spending trends, we will publish the monthly spending profiles which are submitted by Departments at the start of the year. We will also publish corresponding information from the Revenue Commissioners on monthly tax revenue profiles for 2003. Ministers and their management committees will be required to manage strictly within the allocations given to them. I will continue to submit monthly expenditure management reports to Government, reporting on overall spending and revenue trends. Improvements will be made in risk assessment measures and in contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures which may emerge as the year progresses. Spending on demand-led schemes will be managed effectively, as is required in all other spending programmes. I am introducing revised arrangements for managing capital spending. Finally, the financial management system will provide incentives for Departments to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For example, where Departments secure savings as a result of specific efficiency measures or steps they have taken to curtail a programme, these savings should, as a general rule, be available for other high-priority programmes within the same Department. These measures will encourage public service managers to achieve greater efficiency in the management of public expenditure, to the benefit of all. Infrastructure - Capital Spending Our economy has developed substantially in recent years. The number at work has increased by more than 370,000 over the last five years. Our infrastructure needs to catch up. In the National Development Plan, we outlined our vision for the development of the infrastructure required by a modern, dynamic society. We are already making good progress on this. Our existing public spending rate on capital, at 5 per cent of GNP, is nearly double that of the EU generally. This Government has accorded top priority to investment in economic and social infrastructure. We have more than delivered on our financial commitments to this priority in the National Development Plan. In the first three years of the plan the Exchequer has invested almost E9 billion in this area which is nearly E1 billion more than the original commitment. This represents a massive acceleration over pre-plan levels of investment. Unfortunately, cost increases have impacted adversely on output and time-scale, but the plan is continuing to fund projects of unprecedented size, especially in the key area of transport. The Government remains committed to the infrastructure investment strategy in the plan and, indeed, we welcome the continuing broad political and social partner endorsement of this strategy. In recognition of the key importance of the NDP National Roads Programme, I am today allocating an additional E209 million to that programme for 2003. This means that next year the Exchequer will be investing E1.25 billion in the roads programme. The Government is also anxious to explore more radical and innovative approaches to the funding and delivery of the roads programme including, in particular, the scope for greater private-sector investment and potential ways of remunerating this investment. A working group, chaired by the Department of Transport, has been established to examine all options in this regard and to report to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure by January 31st, 2003. I propose to examine the scope for introducing a multi-annual funding envelope for the roads programme in the light of that report. Public-private partnerships To help ensure that public infrastructure projects are financed in a cost-effective manner, I have brought forward legislation to establish the National Development Finance Agency, under the aegis of the NTMA. The new body will advise State authorities in relation to the optimal financing mechanisms for infrastructure projects and ensure that private-sector finance is used where it is most effective. I hope to have the agency operational early in the New Year and this will help to promote the public-private partnership concept. PPPs are making a significant contribution to delivering priority infrastructure projects under the NDP. A milestone in their development will be passed in the near future when the first motorway PPP contract is signed. The various PPP national roads projects will incorporate substantial private finance and real tolls will generate a stream of revenue that will contribute to meeting the cost of this vital infrastructure. Public-private partnerships are also being developed in other sectors including education, the Luas operator and in environmental services. Social Inclusion One of the key objectives of this Budget is protecting the weaker sections of society. We committed ourselves in the agreed Programme for Government to implementing a wide range of social inclusion policies aimed at supporting the most vulnerable in society. Specifically, we are committed within the lifetime of this Government to reducing consistent poverty to below 2 per cent of households and to progressing the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, with its ambitious targets, across a broad range of areas. Since this Government first came into office in 1997 we have significantly reduced consistent poverty and improved living standards - to the benefit of all groups in society. Today's Budget will consolidate the progress that has been made over the past several years. This year the greater pressures on public finances will obviously affect my spending proposals, but nevertheless, I aim, with this social inclusion package, to direct resources to those most in need. Social Welfare Today's social welfare improvements will cost E530 million in a full year. This will bring the gross allocation for the Department of Social and Family Affairs next year to E10.2 billion. As a result of the improvements I will announce today, social welfare expenditure in 2003 will be E4.5 billion higher than it was in 1997, an increase of nearly 80 per cent. Even in these more difficult circumstances the cost of the social welfare increases this year will be twice what it was in 1997. Dormant Accounts Fund The social inclusion area will also benefit next year from the first disbursement of funds from the Dormant Accounts Fund. This fund will be established using unclaimed dormant account monies from financial institutions. The funds disbursed will be spent on charitable and community projects, with a particular focus on children with learning disabilities. Old-Age Pensions Today I am increasing the full personal rate of old-age and related pensions by E10 per week. This will bring the Old-Age Contributory Pension to E157.30 per week and the Old-Age Non-Contributory Pension to E144 per week. This is a first step towards the Programme for Government commitment to increase the State pension to E200 per week. The rate of payment for old-age pensioners will, by 2003, have increased by 59 per cent over the rate payable in 1997. This is well ahead of inflation and represents an enormous improvement in the living standards of our older citizens. Widows and Widowers In line with the targeted increases provided in my last two budgets, today I am providing a further special increase in the weekly rate of the Widows' and Widowers' Contributory Pension for those aged 66 and over to bring the rate of payment closer to that of the Old-Age Contributory Pension. Accordingly, the weekly rate of payment in 2003 for the Widows' and Widowers' Contributory Pension will rise by E11, bringing the payment rate to E155.80 per week, and to E162.20 per week for those aged 80 or over. Child Benefit In Budget 2001, I announced the Government's intention to allocate over E1.27 billion in increased Child Benefit over a three-year period. As I said at the time, our central objective is to support parents in whatever choices they make in looking after their children. Child Benefit is an important financial support for families with dependent children and a key instrument for tackling child poverty. We achieved two-thirds of the planned increase in the last two budgets. However, in the current budgetary circumstances it is not possible to complete the Government's plans this year. I am now announcing an additional E105 million in a full year to increase Child Benefit further. This will see Child Benefit rates increase by E8 per month for first and second children to E125.60, and by E10 per month for third and subsequent children bringing the new rate to E157.30. I intend to complete the planned increase in Child Benefit in 2004 and 2005. Other Social Welfare Measures The summary of Budget measures contains a range of other social welfare improvements, the full details of which will be announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

969,The Irish Times,03/07/2015,Noonan downplays Greek impact on Irish economy; Minister for Finance says uncertainty over Greece will have 'second-round' risk here," Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said the risk to the Irish economy from the uncertain situation in Greece was ""second-round"" in nature as direct trade and financial links between the two countries were small.  While he did set out the risks in a reply to a parliamentary question from Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath, the Minister said Greece had become an outlier in recent months.  ""As financial markets in Greece have been adversely affected through declines in the stock market, capital outflows and increases in bond yields, elsewhere in the euro area markets have been broadly stable,"" Mr Noonan said. The reply was published as exchequer returns for the first half of the year showed that tax payments were some EUR 800 million ahead of target.  The Department of Finance show that the State collected EUR 20.62 billion in tax between January and June, EUR 2.16 billion more than in the same period last year.  Greek uncertainty  Amid uncertainty over the fate of Greece, a note published by the European Central Bank ""bond market contact group"" (BMCG) shows that it had impromptu phone conferences on Monday after Athens called a referendum on the bailout.  Although Italian and Spanish borrowing costs have risen, there has been no major impact as of yet on Irish borrowing costs.  ""Notwithstanding the constructive initial market reaction, BMCG members suggested to remain cautious given that: (i) there are many challenges for Greece over the next few weeks,; and (ii) many market participants are still in a wait-and-see mode,"" said the ECB note.  The exchequer figures show that an unexpected advance in corporation tax payments in the first half of the year accounted for EUR 606 million in the improvement over budget­day forecasts, EUR 170 million of which came from once-off payments from an unspecified number of firms.  Net voted expenditure in the half year reached EUR 20.42 billion, 1.5 per cent or EUR 304 million below profile and EUR 107 million or 0.5 per cent lower in year­on­year terms. Health spending was EUR 33 million, 0.5 per cent above profile, due to hospital and drug costs and welfare spending was EUR 72 million or 0.7 per cent above profile due to spending on the job seeker's allowance.  The exchequer had a EUR 292 million deficit at the end June, down from EUR 4.93 billion one year ago. ""The improvement in the exchequer balance is driven by increased tax and neonates receipts and a number of one-off transactions,"" the Department said. In a statement, Mr Noonan said the EUR 478 million increase in income tax collected, achieved despite reductions in income tax and the USC, provided evidence of the number of jobs being created.  Once-off transactions included EUR 410 million in receipts from the sale of Permanent TSB contingent capital notes and EUR 97 million from the sale of shares in the institution. A further EUR 1.63 billion came via a transfer from the National pension Reserve Fund.  ""Without the one-off transactions the improvement in the deficit would be EUR 2.7 billion,"" said the Department.  While the jump in tax collection marks big improvement on 2014, the Department emphasised that EUR 285 million in corporation tax receipts were delayed from June into July last year as a result of a new European payments system. ""Taking this into account, tax receipts are up EUR 1.87 billion (10 per cent) year­on­year,"" said the Department. Delayed payments  Adjusting for delayed payments last year, corporation tax receipts are up EUR 724 million or 35.5 per cent year­on­year. ""This reflects an improved trading performance across the board and some one off factors,"" the Department said. Income tax receipts rose EUR 478 million year­on­year to EUR 8.31 billion, ""slightly above"" profile by EUR 54 million or 0.7 per cent. ""For the month of June, income tax receipts amounted to EUR 1.27 billion, which were exactly on profile,"" the Department said.",1,debt,,,,,greece
850,The Irish Times,31/10/1992,Leadership deficit in the West adds to crisis,"ETYMOLOGY, ""the science or investigation of the derivation and original signification of words"", as Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary defines it often helps to illuminate contemporary political discourse. Three words much used in current controversies are worth examining from this point of view. Thus ""crisis"" derives from the Greek krinein, to decide, reminding one of its reference to ""decisive moments"" and ""turning Deficit means literally ""there is wanting"", according to the Oxford English Dictionary, which notes especially its usage in accounting for shortfalls between revenues and expenditures. The word also refers back to ""defect"" and from there to the Latin verb defcere, to fail. One should notice also the other sense of defect - ""to fall away from"", as the OED puts it. 'Leadership"" derives from the verb to lead, of course, which Chambers helpfully defines as the ""ability to show the way by going first"". It refers us to the Old English laedan, to lead, and to lad a way. It also refers to the German leiten, to lead. There has been much discussion recently about the leadership deficit or leadership crisis faced by the major Western powers after the end of the Cold War. This week Mr Brian Mulroney joined the ranks of the other Group of Seven leaders who have faced humiliation by their electorates or have proved unequal to the task of encountering the flow of great events. President Bush will have produced a second electoral miracle this year if he manages to snatch victory from Mr Bill Clinton in Tuesday's presidential election. Were he to do so, would he then have to face the same crisis of economic and political credibility that has been visited upon Mr John Major, whose earlier victory provided such a model for his own campaign? Both the US and British economies are, after all, burdened with excessive debt,. the products of deficits both private and public accumulated under Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s. President Mitterrand and Dr Kohl both face their own political crises. The forthcoming French assembly elections are almost certainly about to introduce another period of cohabitation with the right after the narrow vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty. In Germany political instability also looms as the costs of unification, now absorbing some 8 per cent of GNP per annum, bear down relentlessly on the Kohl government. In Italy, the Amato government has a huge fight on its hands to force its austerity programme through parliament although, in contrast to Britain, it has not seen the issue of Maastricht ratification joined to that of economic uncertainty, despite the fact that austerity has been necessitated, inter alia, by the convergence criteria laid down in the treaty for the approach to economic and monetary union. Japan's government, too, has had its political and economic difficulties, as another round of scandaIs reinforced uncertainties engendered by the collapse in value on the stock exchange and the recession. Arguably, however, it is managing its problems most effectively of all the G7 states a fact that is easily obscured by the West's preoccupations with internal problems. Emperor Akihito's visit to China this week brings Asia's richest and most populous powers closer together. It 'must be understood in the wider context of the end of the Cold War, the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the inevitable need for the US to adjust its own presence If it is developed harmoniously this relationship between Tokyo and Beijing will have profound consequences for Asia and the rest of the world into the next century. Already China has normalised relations with South Korea and is developing them rapidly with Vietnam, Thailand and Burma; Japan is consolidating its colossal investments in south-east Asia, has dispatched forces to join the UN operation in Cambodia and is generally in a very good position to benefit from the phenomenal rate of growth which sharply distinguishes this region from the rest of the capitalist world. The other participant at G7 summits, Mr Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, representing the European Community as a whole and especially those smaller states, Ireland included, which do not have a seat at the table, has several good reasons to feel frustrated with current international developments. Although it can be shown convincingly that the Commission is not responsible for the collapse of popular and market confidence which has afflicted the EC in recent months, it has been unjustly blamed for the Maastricht ratification crisis by bigger powers anxious to find scapegoats for their own failures of leadership. Mr Delors is well placed to appreciate the way in which the EC should be blamed for deficits of leadership that should more rationally be allocated elsewhere. He acknowledges that the EMU convergence criteria are deflationary but argues that the cohesion funds for the poorer states are precisely intended to counteract them. The recession which may deepen into depression has had a profound effect on the EC's credibility, he believes, but, according to authoritative sources, he says the Community's finance ministers are too complacent about proposing remedies. It is therefore not surprising if popular indifference should turn to hostility when confronted with an EC which lacks the capacity or the will to address these issues head-on - a deficit of explanation is joined to a deficit of conduct and cannot be reduced merely to a deficit of information. In a sense this is a tribute to the very internationalism the EC is intended to express - and to control. If it responds to the international recession with a variation on Mrs Thatcher's theme that there is no alternative, It is not surprising that the EC is rejected with some vehemence by electorates increasingly confronted with the loss of jobs and growth to which they have become accustomed. Analysts point to the fact that Thatcher, Mitterrand, Kohl and Reagan all came to power in 1979- 80 during a revolt against previous administrations and with new recipes to escape from that recession. A similar pattern may be under way on this occasion, this time with a more pragmatic approach to policy instruments such a Keynesian macroeconomic planning which were rejected as inappropriate in the last decade of monetarism. What have been termed the geoeconomic factors affecting all the G7 leaders, which seem beyond their individual control but strike almost simultaneously throughout an increasingly interdependent industrialised world, would seem to reinforce this argument.",1,geopolitical,greece crisis,,,,usa
194,The Irish Times,10/08/2019,Budget must convey Ireland Inc is open despite general lunacy,"We need some serious thinking on how to hold on to as much of the recent economic gains as possible in what could be a rocky period - and so leave ourselves in a position to build again in the years ahead. If the debate on the October budget is all about whether pensioners are going to get another EUR 5 a week or whether payers of income tax are going to benefit from some small adjustment in a tax band or credit, then we are completely and utterly missing the point.  Our room for manoeuvre in economic policy may narrow very significantly for a period, and so choosing priorities becomes vital. Putting an extra fiver in the pockets of pensioners or taxpayers ahead of a general election is not one of them. It is difficult for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his Ministers to strike the right tone. The economy has been steaming ahead despite all the uncertainties around the place and some signs of nervousness. Now we are facing into the possibility of an economic shock from a no-deal Brexit, which is looking more likely but is far from certain.  Warning lights  Meanwhile warning lights are flashing amber in the world economy, with real fears of a US recession, driven in part by the building trade war between the US and China. And the big EU economies are also in trouble.  The backdrop for Ireland, a small open economy, is changing with remarkable speed. We need to safeguard our gains, and keep our options open as far as we can. And focus on the key things which have allowed our economy to be successful in recent years, and the issues which need to be addressed to ensure this continues. In a world where doors are being closed, Ireland's card is to remain open to trade, to immigration, to our role as a kind of bridgehead for companies entering the EU's market. Our relatively small size makes this possible and to an extent it is obvious, but it needs to drive economic policy too.  Attracting talent  You can't continue to attract the best talent if rents here are among the highest in Europe, for example, or we don't make the kind of investments in public transport and infrastructure to make Ireland move liveable.  Nor can you continue to succeed in today's knowledge-driven economic world if under-investment in third-level education continues. So one key thing in the budget is to send out a message that despite the madness of Brexit and the craziness of Trump's tariffs, normal business continues in Ireland.  We can do nothing about Trump's row with China. Nor, for now anyway, can we do much about Brexit. All the talk about whether Ireland should compromise on the backstop issue means nothing unless some kind of proposal comes on to the table. So far Boris Johnson hasn't shown any inclination to do this.  Sooner or later, before or after Brexit, there will be hard talking to be done, but for now we are spectators in the extraordinary drama that is UK politics.  We need to prepare to deal with the Brexit hit, of course, and there would be real problems in areas like the beef industry other parts of indigenous industry and in rural Ireland. But we also can't lose focus on the bigger picture. During the last downturn there was a massive cut in public investment - one of the causes of the housing shortage and other infrastructure problems we now face. Post-Brexit, and with trade wars potentially raging, we can't make this mistake again. In particular, solving the housing problem is key to maintaining Ireland's openness to inward migration, an essential factor for companies investing here. In some high-tech sectors nearly half of new jobs are filled by people coming from abroad. As well as all the vital social reasons for fixing the housing crisis, this is now a real economic imperative too.  We also need to ensure that the big increase in State investment planned - in public transport, roads, education and health facilities, research and so on - remains on track.  Political rustling  Beyond ensuring that this is the case there is a strong argument not to do much else in the budget because by then we will probably still be in the midst of Brexit uncertainty. Despite all this, as predictably as the annual appearance of the Rose of Tralee on our screens, the pre-budget political rustling is already starting.  The Independent Alliance has let it be known that it wants a EUR 5 across the board increase in pensions and social welfare payments, and Fianna Fáil looks set to row in.  The list of demands will grow as the leaves start to fall from the trees. Our budget debate is at risk of taking place in some kind of parallel universe where Brexit and trade wars do not exist. This is not to say we are heading for some kind of second great economic crash. We don't know whether a no-deal Brexit will happen or what it will mean beyond the likelihood of a sharp hit to growth and our exchequer finances - and real problems for some sectors.  An international growth slowdown would hit us too, though we might be small enough to ride it out.  It's a bit of a cliche calling for a longer-term approach in budget policy and the avoidance of the ""one for everyone in the audience"" approach. It's just that right now, in this budget, as we head for an autumn of uncertainty, we really need to keep our options open and focus on the things which will help us hold on to recent gains and support growth in future.",0,,usa elections,,,,
571,Irish Independent,30/07/2020,Fewer deaths and our determination to keep spending shine light at end of Covid tunnel,"IS THERE light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel? In Ireland and across Europe the numbers of new Covid cases in recent days and weeks remain at a fraction of those recorded last March and April. There have been fresh outbreaks in some places across the continent, but only a handful of places have come close to recording the numbers of cases of last spring. This is despite an end to lockdown and a cautious re-opening across the continent. So far so good, by and large. Even more encouraging is what really matters in a pandemic - the number of deaths. Across the continent fatalities from the disease have fallen precipitously, according to figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. From a peak in April when daily deaths in the thousands were taking place, they have declined by well over 90pc. Ireland is following a similar path to the rest of our continent, with a much reduced number of cases and mercifully few deaths. Another reason for hope is the weakening relationship between the number of new cases and the number of deaths - and that's happening not only in Europe, but across most of the world. Like so much about coronavirus, there are no certainties around why this is happening. Some medics postulate that the virus may have mutated and become less lethal to humans. Another explanation for this worldwide phenomenon is a greater focus on protecting those who are really vulnerable - the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Yet another reason could be because medics are getting better at treating the disease as they understand it better. But whatever the reason for fewer deaths relative to the number of cases, there is no denying how marked the trend has been. What's happening in the United States may be the best example to illustrate this, as that country has been one of the few across the world to experience a full-blown second wave. Up to mid-June the number of new cases recorded each day across the US had been stable for well over a month. Since then cases have soared, and are now three times higher than six weeks ago. There's no doubt that some of that increase is accounted for by increased testing - the US is now conducting more tests per head of population than almost any other country. But even accounting for this nobody denies that the disease has spread fast, particularly in the south and west of the country. The (relatively) good news is that despite so many new cases over the past six weeks, there has been only a modest uptick in Covid fatalities, and the number of people dying each day remains far below last April when pictures of New York's inundated hospitals haunted viewers of news bulletins around the planet. None of this means the world is in any way out of the Covid woods. A vaccine is still months away. More personal interaction, including in schools, will inevitably lead to more localised spikes. And how the virus interacts with the coming winter's usual flu is probably the biggest question of all. The nights of next January could be very dark in more ways than one. Among the reasons they will be grim is the economy. The impact of the virus and the measures taken to contain it will be felt for a decade, and possibly more. As of now, we are not even half a year into the crisis. The response of governments across the world to the slump has been unprecedented. Ireland's surge in government spending has been similar to its rich world peers in magnitude. Last week's 'July stimulus' package essentially tweaked and extended many of the supports that had already been put in place. One could quibble with some of the measures, such as the always insane 'help to buy' home purchase scheme, but the main role of government now is to try to generate more economic activity in as many ways as possible. The on-going spending splurge will go some way to boosting demand. Whether it will be enough, nobody knows. The economic outlook has probably never been as uncertain in living memory. One thing that is certain is that last week's agreement on a European Union Recovery Fund will have much less impact on the bloc's economy than governments' actions have had on national economies since the crisis hit. The centre-piece of the deal is the (EURO)750bn that the European Commission will be allowed to borrow. More than half of this cash will be handed over to the 27 member governments, and will not have to be paid back. This might seem like a lot of money, but in reality it is not, particularly when spread over a number of years, as is planned. To see how modest it is in the grand scheme of things consider that over the past five months the European Central Bank has printed more money in its pandemic programme than the (EURO)390bn that will be distributed by Brussels over years in new grants. The Recovery Fund will have an impact, but only at the margins. Better news from an Irish perspective came this week. New figures published on Tuesday showed that the amount of stuff purchased from the nation's retailers in June surpassed the pre-Covid months. After a dramatic and historic collapse in retail sales during March and April, a perfect V-shaped rebound occurred in May and June. That consumers had the willingness and the wherewithal to spend more or less as much they had been doing before the virus hit gives reason to hope that we are not at the beginning of the 21st century's rerun of the Great Depression.

326,The Irish Times,04/07/2018,"Corporation tax drives very strong exchequer returns; Concerns about reliance on corporate sector, which contributes 16% of tax take"," Another surge in corporation tax receipts in the first half of 2018 has put the Government on course to exceed its budgetary targets for the year.  While the stronger-than-expected performance, detailed in the latest exchequer returns, is expected to increase the clamour for tax cuts in the budget, it has renewed concern about the Government's increasing reliance on corporation tax, which now accounts for 16 per cent of the State's total tax take. In addition, worries about overspending in health budgets are escalating in Government with yesterday's figures showing health spending is EUR 167 million above its projected level. The exchequer figures show the Government collected just under EUR 25 billion in taxes in the year to the end of June, which was 5 per cent up on last year and more than EUR 168 million ahead of target. The strong performance was driven by corporation tax receipts, which brought in a record EUR 4 billion for the six-month period, which was 9.1 per cent or EUR 335 million above what the department had targeted. Tech giants About 40 per cent of the revenue generated from corporation tax here comes from just 10 firms. It is understood these include tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Dell, Google and Oracle. The Government has been warned repeatedly not to rely on current corporate tax growth to fund permanent spending measures given the increasingly uncertain outlook internationally. The Republic's economy has been the best performing in the EU for the past three years, swelling the Government's tax take in the process. The latest returns show income tax, the Government's largest tax stream, generated EUR 9.6 billion, which was 1 per cent ahead of target for the period, reflecting the current strength of the labour market. Separate figures from Central Statistics Office (CSO)showed unemployment fell to a new post-crash low of 5.1 per cent in June, a level not seen since October 2007 just prior to the financial crisis. The strong performances in income and corporation tax in the latest returns more than offset a forecasted shortfall in excise duty, which came in at EUR 2.47 billion or EUR 188 million below target. Despite the positive exchequer figures, there is growing concern at escalating spending in the Department of Health.  Budget overrun According to the exchequer returns, the overrun in health spending is at EUR 167 million. However, sources say that the underlying level of budget overrun is higher given that the health service also returned deficits last year. Official figures show that level of spending is EUR 600 million higher than last year. The total health budget is over EUR 15 billion this year. Speaking in the Dáil, Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said health spending at the end of May was running at 10 per cent higher than last year. Mr Donohoe also said that the health service was recruiting over 300 new staff every month.  ""That does not sit with some of the narratives that are at times painted about the recruitment difficulties we have with our health services. I am working closely with the Minster for Health on this and we will have to be clear as to where this matter stands in advance of the budget,"" he said.",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
840,The Irish Times,09/03/2015,"Keynesian odd one out of Germany s five  wise men ; Prof Peter Bofinger, one of a panel of economic advisers to Merkel, is not bothered by being in a minority of one","Life in Germany can be lonely if you're Peter Bofinger. To paraphrase Little Britain, he's the only Keynesian in the village. The 50-year-old economist is one of the ""five wise men"" who advise the federal government on economic affairs. But, since the outbreak of the euro crisis, he has become the most vocal opponent of Berlin's rescue strategy. The Merkel administration - and much of Germany's economic, political and media establishment - view structural reform and budget cuts as preconditions to recovery. Prof Bofinger has argued for a demand-oriented response of anti-cyclical public investment and a more pragmatic approach to debt. In most of Europe, that would place him at the heart of the economic and political mainstream. In Germany, it has made him a prophet in the desert.  ""I don't view it as lonely, my views give me a certain unique identifying factor,"" said Prof Bofinger, who teaches at the University of WÃ¼rzburg in Franken, northern Bavaria. Postwar Germany's prevailing political and economic ideology, the social market economy, foresees a very limited role for the state. It creates a framework in which markets can operate freely, intervening only when grave distortions occur. This thinking, based on ordoliberal principles, is critical of Keynesian ideas and rejects its core idea: expansionary public sector investment in a downturn as crucial to fill the economic gap left by the retreating private sector. Germany's mainstream thinks different: state economic intervention is only permissible after first pruning back the economy, to make taxpayer money go further. Coupled with a stringent view of budget deficits, this is the logic that runs the German economy and which is visible on EU/IMF bailout programmes for Greece, Ireland and others. Though considered common economic sense in Germany, it has been castigated as reckless austerity by neighbours. Peter Bofinger is one of the few prominent Germans who agree with Berlin's critics.  He comes from a contrarian tradition: studying under Prof Wolfgang StÃ¼tzel - a some-time proponent of deficit spending - who in turn had studied with Wilhelm Lautenbach, dubbed Germany's ""pre-Keynesian Keynes"". But Keynesian theories are a minority pursuit in Germany, discarded by a mainstream that has framed the euro crisis as a debt crisis caused by profligate periphery countries requiring solidarity from EU core - with strict, ordoliberal conditions. The resulting friction between Germany and its neighbours is as much cultural as economic. The word for debt in German - Schuld - is also the word for guilt, creating a strong cultural association between the two. Prof Bofinger sees in Berlin's response to the crisis a ""Schuldturm (debt tower) mentality"" dating back to the Middle Ages. Then, in a deterrent to others, debtors were locked in a tower until they paid their dues. Such towers still stand in some German cities, including in the Frankonian capital of NÃ¼rnberg, near WÃ¼rzburg where Prof Bofinger teaches. ""This is precisely the politics that Germany is pursuing today, in particular with Greece,"" said Prof Bofinger. ""They wanted to punish Greece with extra-high interest rates and punish them so they don't do this again."" Characteristic of this approach, he says, is Berlin's single-minded rigour in demanding that countries fulfil the terms of their EU/IMF ""adjustment programmes"" while simultaneously distancing themselves from the political consequences. ""People here don't want to see that we had a role in bringing radical forces to power in Greece,"" he said. ""Rather than Berlin agreeing to give [ex-prime minister] Samaras a few billion to help fight youth unemployment last year they let him starve and are amazed that they get Tsipras and Varoufakis."" As a well-placed observer, Prof Bofinger is concerned at a new nationalist streak he perceives in Germany's EU debate, coupled with a blinkered logic in the new Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party and across Germany's mainstream media. From the best-selling Bild tabloid to the business pages of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine, it is a narrative with regular flashes of encirclement angst: that Germany is surrounded by spend-thrift neighbours who want its money and, in their determination to get it, are reinterpreting euro-zone rules on the fly. ""It's a very national-oriented and stupid way of thinking that says Germany's economy is in better shape than for many a year, without asking where it comes from,"" said Prof Bofinger. ""Behind this debate is a lingering feeling here that we are the most virtuous, that we are harder working and saved more while others were lazy, lived beyond their means and thus their countries are dumps."" Cause and effect For him, this blinkered narrative excludes the basics of economic cause and effect: that Germany's export boom and trade surplus are the mirror image of others' import booms and trade deficits. ""The debate here overlooks how we had extra-low wages for a decade to artificially boost our competitiveness and gave loans to [crisis] countries to buy our products - and that exports have taken off as a result.""  ""People here don't see how the euro was perfect for our export industry. Instead the discussion concentrates on the EUR 60 or EUR 80 billion Germany may lose in Greece - which would be manageable - without looking at the financial benefits we in Germany have from the euro."" Being regularly outnumbered in public debates is often what makes Prof Bofinger such an interesting voice. He ensures that the press conferences of the German Council of Economic Experts (SachverstÃ¤ndigenrat) are always good value. The events commence with a cool air of professorial civility but eventually descend into a shouting match, where Prof Bofinger happily contradicts his four colleagues on almost everything they say. From euro bonds to an EU probe of Germany's trade surplus, Prof Bofinger has been in favour while his colleagues thunderous in their condemnation. Most recently, Prof Bofinger backed a statutory minimum wage of EUR 8.50, describing it an overdue step to drive domestic demand and address concerns of Germany's neighbours over its trade surplus. His ""wise men"" colleagues (including one woman) disagreed, dubbing the minimum wage a ""social political experiment with uncertain outcome"". Prof Bofinger rubbished such claims in their November 2014 report, saying that a minimum wage was standard practice across Europe and that the EUR 8.50 rate put Germany firmly in the mid-range.  Two months into the new minimum-wage regime, the sky has yet to fall. But employer groups and the business wing of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are still on the war-path, attacking the minimum wage as overly bureaucratic for demanding, among other things, that employers document the hours their employees work. Their concerns, reflected extensively in the media, are not shared by 86 per cent of Germans who consider the EUR 8.50 pay floor a good idea, according to a survey conducted this week by the Infratest Dimap agency.  ""I said the minimum wage would work, the others said it would cause 1 million extra jobless yet the minimum wage is here and the jobless rate is dropping,"" said Prof Bofinger. ""The majority were wrong and the minority opinion right but you can't get that into the media here."" Considering how often they disagree - the four ""wise men"" suggested last week, without him, that the euro zone might be stronger without Greece - it was striking when Prof Bofinger agreed with their criticism of ECB quantitative easing (QE). The WÃ¼rzburg professor says he has a lot of respect for the ECB crisis management to date and for president Mario Draghi. But flagging dates and quantities of bond purchases brought Draghi into a classic Zugzwang and forced him to move. ""If I were Draghi I would have made the announcement, then said it was on standby and ready to use but that the private sector had bought up enough so there was no need for a large-scale ECB intervention.  ""Even the number - EUR 1.1 trillion - makes no sense because it dates from a time in 2012 when the banks were completely insecure."" The ECB decision has undermined further already dwindling confidence in the central bank and the euro among Germany's middle classes, he warns. Corrosive Unlike most of their EU neighbours, Germans are more likely to finance for retirement with savings, pensions and other funds rather than investing in property. Even in a low-inflation era Germans view low interest rates as a creeping disappropriation, says Prof Bofinger, with a corrosive effect both on their savings and on confidence towards the responsible institution.  ""Because I hold the ECB in high esteem I don't like to see how QE has spread dissatisfaction through the German middle classes."" As a proponent of the more aggressive crisis approach adopted by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, he says it is of little help that the ECB's crisis strategy has been conservative by international standards. Ever the contrarian, the WÃ¼rzburg economist suggests the time has come for the bank to surprise everyone and adopt a more bold strategy. ""We have a fundamental problem today with the philosophy that central banks have to be calculable, that markets have to understand them.  ""Wrong: I think markets should be afraid of central banks and know little else about them and how they act apart, except that they have deep pockets and a long-term mission.""",0,,taxes,,,,
1341,The Irish Times,31/03/2015,Time to build on our economic turnaround,"When climbing an Irish mountain there is often disappointment - you think that the summit is just over the next ridge only to discover that there is still more climbing to be done.  The tale of the Irish national debt during the recent crisis was a bit like climbing a mountain: as things got worse each year it looked as if it would soon peak, but new problems were then discovered that pushed it ever higher.  However, things have turned out better than the most gloomy prognostications: the debt/GDP ratio is now declining, the burden of the interest on the debt is exceptionally low, and we may get back a significant part of the money we had to put into the banks. The advent of the crisis saw gradually increasing fears about how high the mountain of government debt would rise.  Some pessimists believed the burden of debt would prove unsustainable. The nadir was the autumn of 2010, when the interest rate faced by the government climbed to exceptional levels; effectively the government was no longer able to borrow at any feasible interest rate, leaving it with no option but to seek the assistance of colleagues in the EU through a bailout.  The agreement reached with the troika in December 2010 provided the government with access to all the funding it needed at what then appeared to be an acceptable interest rate.  The bulk of the funding came from other euro zone governments and the IMF, but a significant contribution also came from Denmark, Sweden and the UK.  The assistance from the last three governments was volunteered by them in solidarity with the Irish government, and it was also provided at a very attractive interest rate. (They did not provide similar assistance to any other governments.)  Subsequent negotiations between the EU and Greece saw the interest rate on borrowing from the EU cut for all countries, including Ireland. While Ireland has brought its government deficit down steadily from its peak in 2009 of 11 per cent of GDP, the need to borrow every year to keep schools open and pay welfare payments in the teeth of a massive collapse in government revenue added almost EUR 100 billion to the debt between 2009 and 2015.  In addition, the funding put into the banks amounted to over EUR 60 billion. So Ireland's national debt rose by around EUR 160 billion since the crash, and the debt/GDP ratio peaked at 123 per cent in 2013.  However, the effective burden on the Irish economy of this debt, as measured by the debt interest to GDP ratio, has proved much lighter than might have been anticipated because of very low interest rates and our success in converting high-interest rate IMF debt into debt at lower rates. Debt interest In the mid-1980s between 8per cent and 9 per cent of Irish GDP went on paying interest on the very large Irish national debt. Even by the mid-1990s, when the economy was booming, debt interest still accounted for over 5 per cent of GDP.  However, this year debt interest will fall below 4 per cent of GDP, and will fall further over the rest of the decade, leaving additional fiscal space for the next government.  Thus, even with a high level of debt, the burden on the economy is dramatically lower than when Ireland exited the previous financial crisis of the 1980s, and it has not held back an economic recovery. Even if growth over the rest of the decade slows gradually from 2014's exceptionally high rate the value of GDP will continue to rise, reducing the burden of the debt. Continued growth would also allow the next government both to run a balanced budget over the period 2016-20 and still achieve some improvement in the quality of public services.  It is a plausible scenario that the debt/GDP ratio could fall below 80 per cent of GDP by 2020.  The government-owned banks are being restored to financial health. There is now the prospect that Ireland may be able to recover about half of the very large sum needed to recapitalise the banks after the crash. If a successful sale of the banks can be completed by 2020, that could further lower the debt/GDP ratio to 70 per cent.  This would bring our debt back down to German levels. The hard way However, we have learned the hard way not to rely on favourable scenarios for the future. Many things can go wrong, either in the European economy or through domestic policy mistakes, which might derail the Irish economy.  Fiscal policy must be framed with such uncertainty in mind. Nonetheless, the low interest payments, which are locked in for the next decade, will continue to limit the burden of the debt on the economy. Our bailout will ultimately prove to have been achieved on pretty favourable terms.  There are two issues where there is a legitimate sense of grievance. The first relates to the requirement to repay the unsecured bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank. However, while the total amount involved, around EUR 5 billion, is infuriating, it is nevertheless only a small fraction of the cost of the banking collapse.  The second has been the failure by EU governments to deliver on their apparent commitment in 2012 to share the burden of recapitalising the banks. This may turn out to be to Ireland's advantage if we are now able to realise more when we sell the banks on the market than we would have been offered in 2012.  It is now time to move on from our grievances and build on the results of a successful turnaround in the economy.",1,debt,,,,,ireland
1114,Irish Independent,04/06/2007,Reform of stamp duty is at top of Fianna Fail's to-do list in the Dail,"FIANNA Fail is planning to rush through stamp duty reforms on its first day back in office to provide ""certainty"" in the housing market.  The party, which is currently negotiating a potential coalition deal with the Greens, made a pre-election pledge to end stamp duty for first-time buyers and to backdate it to April 30.  Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said yesterday that his party would introduce legislation to make the changes ""immediately"" on returning to Government.  ""Our proposals allow first-time buyers, the lifeblood of the housing market, to proceed with their purchases with confidence. They will eliminate uncertainty and they will support and protect our construction industry.""  The stamp duty exemption will apply to all first-time buyers, whether they are buying a new home or a secondhand home. Currently, first-time buyers have to pay stamp duty on new homes of more than 125sqm in size and on secondhand homes worth more than 317,500. If Mr Ahern is able to form a government when the Dail meets on June 14, the stamp duty reform bill will be put through the Oireachtas before June 22.  Mr Ahern said the proposals were targeted, affordable, and would not disrupt the housing market.   ""We recognise how important the construction industry is to our success. It directly employs 282,000 people across the country and many tens of thousands more in related industries.""  The announcement comes as a report by AIB predicts that 10,000 jobs in the construction industry will be lost next year because of the slowdown in the market.  In an article in the 'Sunday Independent', Mr Ahern said the measures would steady the housing market ""at a risky juncture"".  ""The uncertainty of the past few months had the potential to damage the housing market, which would have obvious and knock-on effects in the wider economy.""  House buyers paid around 1bn in stamp duty last year. According to Fianna Fail's election manifesto, the cost of abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers will rise from 44m this year to 109m in 2008 and to 200m in 2012.  The party had attacked Labour and Fine Gael over their promises for stamp duty reforms. It then did a U-turn and announced its own plans for reform at the start of the election campaign.  Mr Ahern said his party had always supported home ownership, which was ""one of the primary aspirations of the people of Ireland"". ",1,regulation,public debt,,,,ireland
1071,The Irish Times,22/03/2021,Pressures on public finances demand a plan; Long-standing issues and the legacy from the pandemic must be addressed,"Light may be appearing at the end of the Covid-19 crisis with lower infections and the vaccination programme building. But the winter has taken a heavy toll on the public finances: support measures needed since the budget and lost tax revenue have cost several billion euro.  Next month, the Government will publish its annual stability programme update. A new fiscal plan is needed for 2021 given developments this winter. The Covid contingency allocated in Budget 2021 is on track to be used up, while extended employment supports will put pressure on the economic recovery fund. The huge budget deficit will narrow as the pandemic eases, reducing the number of people on government supports and increasing tax revenue. There are many scenarios for the recovery, but stimulus support for the economy will be needed this year and likely beyond.  The Government has also promised to deliver in the stability programme a roadmap for how Ireland will return to a broadly balanced budget in the years ahead. Budget 2021 forecast government debt to peak at about 115 per cent of national income this year, a high level by historical comparison. However, interest rates remain very low, and combined with economic growth this will tend to reduce the debt ratio. There is a lively debate internationally about how far to use these favourable debt dynamics to support demand, including around US president Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package.  Fiscal stimulus The  Irish Fiscal Advisory Council brought together some of the world's leading economists at a recent conference to explore this question. The favourable debt dynamics have allowed a strong response to Covid-19 and provide some room for manoeuvre. Nevertheless, there remain many questions about how much expansionary policy is needed or how sustainable this would be. In the euro area, the case for investment-driven fiscal stimulus is strengthened by sluggish pre-crisis growth and weak inflation. However, we cannot expect interest rates to stay so low forever. A new paper from the fiscal council shows how higher initial debt translates into a more unstable path for government debt. For Ireland, the debt ratio will eventually need to be brought to a lower and safer level over time, not least to restore the capacity to address any future crisis. Running a balanced budget would lower the debt burden at a steady pace. Some measures may be needed to achieve this in the later years of this Government, although nothing like what Ireland has experienced in the past. Compared with other countries, the recovery in Ireland may be strong and the Government has embarked on a major programme of public investment of about 4.5 per cent of gross national income - the total amount of money earned by Ireland's people and businesses each year - far above the EU average. Beyond the questions of temporary stimulus and restoring balance, there lurks a much bigger question about how to fund ongoing current government spending in the years ahead. The public finances face substantial pressures from the legacy of the crisis and long-standing issues. First, pensions spending is rising by about EUR 500 million a year. Second, the programme for government commits to the implementation of ambitious programmes, including the Sláintecare health reforms that bring wider publicly-provided healthcare coverage. Third, excessive reliance on corporation tax needs to be reduced. Fourth, measures to address climate change may have significant costs.  Fiscal space The programme for government complicated this picture by taking a large range of tax and spending measures off the table. The fiscal space has been further narrowed by permanent spending increases of up to at least EUR 5.4 billion  already made in Budget 2021. Post-Covid budgets will look very different from what we have known. In past years, the growth of tax revenues pre-crisis was more than enough to match the rising costs of public services and welfare payments, leaving a significant amount for government to allocate on budget day to new projects.  Health spending increases -largely coming through unplanned overruns - were mainly financed by unexpected corporate tax receipts. The ""growth dividend"" will disappear in the coming years as the rising costs of ""standing still"" in policy terms will outstrip revenue growth because of increases in pension costs. There will need to be a real prioritisation.  The Government needs to set out in April a roadmap that is more than just a forecast for how the budget returns to balance. Uncertainty remains high, but we have a clearer picture of what lies ahead than a year ago with multiple vaccines and a Brexit deal. Fundamental questions need to be answered about how to prioritise the competing pressures on government spending and what role changes in tax will play over the life of the Government. The Commission on Pensions and Commission on Taxation may play an important role, but these are ultimately political choices.

368,Irish Independent,13/02/2013,"Debt deal doesn't change the need for budget cutbacks, warns Davy; Stockbroker says next move for Government is to extend terms of bailout loans","THE Government will stick to its programme of planned budgetary cuts, despite the deal on the controversial promissory notes, stockbroker Davy has forecast. It also claimed that the State would save on average (EURO)800m a year on interest costs as the deal sees the extension of cheap ECB funding at 0.75pc. The Government announced last week that the promissory notes used to help bail out the now-defunct Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide would be replaced with long-term government bonds. But the stockbroker said that while the savings were significant, they would not be ""transformative for the budgetary arithmetic"". Conall MacCoille, Davy's chief economist, told the Irish Independent: ""We''re not going to be changing our forecasts widely on the back of this. Impact ""Perhaps there is some positive impacts on confidence that could help in the margin, but in terms of the fiscal consolidation, we don''t expect it to be a big impact and we''ve still got quite a big one (Budget) this year and a substantial one next year."" Davy said the decision by Europe''s finance ministers last month to look at extending the terms of some of Ireland''s bailout loans could be more significant than the promissory notes agreement. The stockbroker said the underlying benefit of the deal was small for the years up to 2015, with little impact this year because of the cost to the Government of the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee scheme (ELG), under which depositors at the now-liquidated Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) can claim. The Government expects this could cost the Exchequer up to (EURO)1.1bn this year. Davy''s central view is that the Government will stick to its programme of planned budgetary cuts amounting to 2.5pc of economic output this year and 1.8pc next year. ""With the growth outlook uncertain and the Government locked in negotiations to secure savings on overshooting current expenditure, there is little room for manoeuvre,"" Davy said. Exchequer Announcing the deal last week, both Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Finance Minister Michael Noonan said the State would have to borrow (EURO)20bn less over the next decade as a result. It also claimed that spending cuts and tax increases would be (EURO)1bn less up to 2015. Davy said the next step for the Government would be to extend the terms of the EU/IMF bailout loans. It claimed that the proposal agreed by Europe''s finance ministers last month to consider extending the terms of some of the loans could be more significant than the promissory note deal. ""Extending EU/IMF funding could reduce funding needs by (EURO)43bn - more than twice the (EURO)20bn reduction in the NTMA''s funding requirement - out to 2023, due to the agreed extension of ECB funding,"" Mr Mac-Coille said.",0,,,,,,
1117,The Irish Times,27/10/2010,Rehn visit to hammer home reality of EUR 15bn nightmare,"ANALYSIS:If there is a silver lining it is that the move marks a decisive step towards providing some certainty for people, writes STEPHEN COLLINS THE GOVERNMENT S decision to opt for a budget adjustment of EUR 15 billion over the next four years, with a significant proportion of that figure being front-loaded into next year, has put the challenge facing the country into sharp focus. The magnitude of the four-year figure, double what was being planned only a few months ago, is truly scary. It will put a huge strain on the political system and will test the cohesion of Irish society. If there is a sliver lining in yesterday s announcement is that it marks a decisive step towards providing some certainty for people about what lies ahead. The continued uncertainty of the past few months about the state of the public finances and the banks has exacerbated our economic woes by dampening consumer spending and encouraging saving. Ministers now have two weeks to make critical decisions about how the burden of the adjustment is to be shared. After that the publication of the four-year plan before the middle of November, followed by the budget three weeks later, will determine whether the country is capable of dealing with its problems in a mature way. The visit to Ireland of Olli Rehn, EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, to brief the Opposition parties and the social partners in the second week of November about the nature of the problem as seen from Brussels will be an interesting exercise. It should serve as a reality check for all of those who have been trying to argue that the scale of the adjustment being undertaken by the Government is unnecessary. While there is no arguing with the proposition that the present state of the country is primarily the responsibility of Fianna Fáil-led governments, the deep involvement of the social partners in the disastrous decision-making of the Ahern era is widely ignored. That is why it is only right and proper that Rehn should spell out the brutal reality of the choices now facing the country to the social partners, who participated in creating the mess, as well as to the Opposition parties who, in fairness, did not. The Government statement yesterday made it clear that the four-year plan will contain a lot of information about the 2011 budget as well as the budgets of the following three years. The size of the adjustment for 2011 and the distribution over the remaining years will be announced in the four-year plan. The plan will contain targets for growth and strategies for the achievement of those targets, said the statement. In interviews later, Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan refused to be drawn on the figure for the adjustment required for next year but he did concede that a significant level of front-loading would be involved. That would seem to put next year s correction at a minimum of EUR 5 billion and quite possibly a lot more than that. It means that almost everybody is going to suffer serious pain. Tax increases on everybody, including the lower paid, are certain. So too are cuts in most welfare payments and it will be difficult to exclude pensions as has been done up to now. Remaining tax breaks for the wealthy should finally go, but so too will tax breaks for people on middling incomes. A real test of the Government s willingness to spread the load evenly will be whether public service pensions continue to remain immune from cuts. If people on the much-lower State pension face a cut and tax relief on private sector pensions is reduced, it would be impossible to justify the current policy of exempting public service pensions from all cuts. The Government has adopted the target of an average growth rate of 2.75 per cent for the next four years. If that level of growth doesn t materialise the adjustment will be even bigger than EUR 15 billion, but if the world economy starts to grow strongly the correction may not be as painful as expected. The critical thing is to get the number of jobs growing in the economy but that will take time even with the best-case scenarios. The political challenge facing the Government is enormous. It has been forced into a position where it is attempting to implement what would have been politically unthinkable only a few months ago. So far there has been no sign that the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition could crack under the strain but that could change very quickly. What is more likely is that the nerve of some of Fianna Fáil backbenchers might crack. It has taken some time to bring Ministers around to thinking the unthinkable but backbench TDs, who haven t had the benefit of exercising power, are more likely to jib at having to accept responsibility for decisions that will appal them. While the Government looks stable, its voting majority in the Dáil has frequently been reduced to four in recent months. It means that if Michael Lowry and Jackie Healy Rae decide to vote against the budget the result will be a tie. Just one more desertion and the Government could be defeated. It will not be easy for the Opposition either. Over the past few weeks the Government has made a lot of play about getting Fine Gael and Labour to accept the target of getting the budget deficit down to 3 per cent by 2014. While both parties have accepted the target they will be loath to accept the measures that go with it, regardless of briefings from Olli Rehn. Still, they will need to come up with viable alternatives if they find either the four-year plan or the budget unacceptable. Stephen Collins is Political Editor",0,,,,,,
853,The Irish Times,15/06/2016,Leave campaign signals sheer power of populist forces,"Suppose that the Leave campaign, which one might call Project Lie, wins the referendum next week. How bad might the economic consequences over the next few years be? Alas, they might be very bad indeed. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, noted when launching the May inflation report: ""The [monetary policy committee] judges that the most significant risks to its forecast concern the referendum."" Moreover, he added, ""a vote to leave the EU could have material economic effects - on the exchange rate, on demand and on the economy's supply potential - that could affect the appropriate setting of monetary policy"".  The latest inflation report adds that the campaign has already partly caused sterling's depreciation. The UK treasury has provided a thorough analysis of short-term risks. This is, inevitably, controversial. But it is important to remember that the treasury is notoriously sceptical about the EU.  Its main scenario is that gross domestic product would be 3.6 per cent lower after two years than if the UK voted to stay, unemployment 520,000 higher and the pound 12 per cent lower.  Under a worse scenario, GDP would be 6 per cent lower, unemployment 820,000 higher and sterling 15 per cent lower. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has added that - instead of an improvement of £8 billion a year in the fiscal position if the net contribution to the EU fell - the budget deficit might be between £20 billion and £40 billion higher in 2019-20 than otherwise. Far more important than such inevitably uncertain forecasts is the analysis of the three channels through which Brexit would work in the short term. These are the ""transition effect"", which would come from the perception that the UK had become permanently poorer; the ""uncertainty effect"", which would come from unavoidable ignorance about the post-Brexit policy regime; and, finally, the ""financial conditions effect"", which would work via the perception that the UK was a less appealing and riskier place in which to invest money. An important question is whether modelled possibilities capture all the tail risks. The answer is that they do not. The treasury argues that the economy might reach a ""tipping point"" after which worse outcomes would occur - thus ""a shock to sterling might cause a sudden contraction in foreign currency lending to UK banks"".  Since about half of banks' short-term wholesale funding is in foreign currencies, reduced access to such funding could then cause further significant financial instability. Source of fragility  An obvious source of fragility is the huge current account deficit. This reached 7 per cent of GDP in the last quarter of 2015. Carney has stated that the UK is dependent on ""the kindness of strangers"" for sustaining its current standard of living. More precisely, it depends on their confidence.  The current account deficit brings risks even in normal times. But the uncertainty caused by Brexit might cause a sharp turnround in capital flows. Net inward foreign direct investment might collapse, for example.  The results could include a sharp decline in sterling, a fall in the prices of sterling-denominated bonds and a jump in the inflation rate. If this were merely caused by a negative shock to demand, the MPC could respond with expansionary policy.  Even so, it would be forced into unconventional policies, possibly including negative rates, given how low interest rates are.  But, if Brexit were also viewed as a negative shock to supply (as it would almost certainly be), the case for monetary offsets would be weaker. The higher prices would then be a way to deliver the needed suppression of real demand.  Tory division  A crucial source of fragility, on which the treasury naturally says nothing, is political. After the referendum, the UK would cease to have a government in any meaningful sense.  The Conservative Party, with a tiny majority, would be deeply divided between its pro- and anti-European wings. The opposition Labour Party is already deeply divided on this and many other issues. Out of this morass would have to come a competent government with a view of what it wants to achieve in complex negotiations with the rest of the EU and the world.  It would then have to undertake these negotiations with partners that have many other concerns and would regard the UK with a poisonous blend of hostility and contempt.  It would have to decide whether to keep or modify the laws created by more than four decades of EU membership and, if the latter, how to do so. It would have to manage the impact of Brexit on the coherence of the UK and its relations with Ireland.  While doing all this, it would have to manage the economy, the fiscal position and the minutiae of political life. Anybody who believes the leaders of the Brexit campaign could manage all this is surely taking illegal drugs. Moreover, the consequences of Brexit are unlikely to be limited to the UK. The direct impact of British economic instability on the world might not be large, though the euro zone is not in a good position to cope with negative shocks.  But the indirect effects might be sizeable. Outsiders might view the UK's departure as a sign that the EU is a sinking ship. Inside the EU, nationalists and xenophobes would take heart. Brexit might, in such ways, prove an important blow to the EU.  At the least, it would force a huge diversion of attention and effort. Yet perhaps the most important consequence might be as a signal of the sheer power of populist forces. If the UK can choose Brexit, maybe Donald Trump will become president of the US. Brexit, in sum, might be a big economic shock and not just for the UK. This is largely because of the fragility that precedes it and the many uncertainties that would follow it. The referendum is itself irresponsible. The outcome might well prove devastating. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016",1,monetary,,,,,ireland
1318,The Irish Times,16/10/2009,"The State has seen the future, and it works","ECONOMICS:We only have to look at our own recent history to determine the most appropriate tax burden for returning us to growth THE NATIONAL Economic and Social Council (NESC) published an interesting report on the grave state of the nation this week. Next Steps in Addressing Ireland s Five-Part Crisis: Combining Retrenchment with Reform represented a brave and thoughtful attempt (mainly by the council s secretariat, I suspect) to construct a conceptual framework around which some form of national solidarity might be mobilised to get the economy out of the mess it s in. An important message that shines through in the report is that successfully addressing the crisis requires much more than a merely technocratic approach. The solutions are not simply a matter of applying the results of desiccated analysis. For the enterprise to work it will also require a vision of the kind of economy/society we re trying to create, trust in the integrity and competence of the institutions involved, and a sense that the whole endeavour is infused with fairness. These are my words, by the way, not the NESC s, but I believe they reflect the essence of the report. Newspaper coverage of the report suggested the NESC s view is that further tax increases will be required to resolve the public finance element of the crisis. Actually, the NESC doesn t go quite that far. What it does say is that there is scope for the tax burden to increase without making us a high-tax State, which may not amount to the same thing. This proposition, whatever its policy implications, is based on a comparison of Ireland s tax/gross national product (GNP) ratio with the equivalent ratios for other EU member states. Such comparisons show that the Irish tax burden is significantly lighter than the EU average and, according to the NESC, indicate that the Irish ratio is among the lowest in the EU27. International comparisons of this sort provide a useful point of reference for policymaking, but they need to be treated with circumspection. In the first instance, there is so much diversity across the EU (the tax/GDP ratio ranges from sub-30 per cent in Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia to almost 50 per cent in Sweden and Denmark) that the EU average is not very meaningful. This raises the obvious question: with what subset of EU members does it make most sense to compare Ireland? From an economic viewpoint, one obvious answer is those countries with which Ireland most closely competes for mobile factors of production, especially capital and skilled labour. I don t believe any of the high-tax Scandinavian countries would make it on to such a list, but the UK certainly would, and its tax burden is considerably lower than the EU average and not that different from Ireland s. Looked at another way, one might ask what conclusions are to be drawn from the discovery that the tax burden in Ireland is significantly lower than the equivalent ratio in countries with much higher military spending, a higher death rate (because of a much higher proportion of elderly people), and a higher stock of outstanding government debt (necessitating a higher level of debt service). Many of the relatively highly taxed mainland European countries fall into this category. The point is we should be capable of financing public services of comparable quality to such countries but at significantly lower cost in terms of the tax burden. I suspect that less reliable guidance about the appropriate tax burden for a particular country is to be gleaned from international comparisons than from the country s own recent history, particularly if that spans a period of outstanding economic success. This brings me to the speech by the new Central Bank governor, Patrick Honohan, at the Economic and Social Research Institute s Budget Perspectives conference on Tuesday. Honohan reminded his audience that it was less than a decade since the Irish economy was on a strong sustainable growth path, and suggested that restoring the structure of the economy to that which had been obtained at the turn of the millennium provided a template for returning to healthy employment-generating growth. He also suggested that resolving the fiscal crisis could be achieved by returning to the ratios of tax and public spending to GNP that had prevailed around that time. What would this entail for the tax burden? By my reckoning, the ratio of tax (including PRSI receipts) to GNP this year will be about 31.5 per cent. This compares with an average of 35 per cent from 1998 to 2000, the halcyon days of the export-driven, highly competitive Celtic Tiger, and seems to imply there is scope for increasing taxes from current levels. However, two important upward adjustments have to be made to the 2009 figure. First, the full-year effects of the tax increases announced in the budgets of last October and April have not yet been felt; when they are, they will raise the tax burden by about 1 percentage point. Second, the tax/GNP ratio can be expected to increase automatically as the economy recovers. Quite how big this effect will be is uncertain, but it is hard to believe it will be much less than 2.5 percentage points. Taken together, these two effects should be enough to push the tax/GNP ratio back up to its level of a decade ago. Strict application of the Honohan formula, therefore, would mean avoiding further tax increases and seeking to achieve the large fiscal adjustment that is required exclusively by means of expenditure cuts. No doubt it will invite vigorous rebuttal on that account. However, the type of fiscal settings that Honohan is advocating clearly worked, in that they were associated with and helped to create vigorous growth and a sustainable pattern of economic activity. And that, at a time when vision and confidence are sorely needed, is an idea with the potential to concentrate minds in a positive way. It s a case of: we ve seen the future and it works. jim.oleary@nuim.ie",0,,brexit,,,,
965,The Irish Times,27/07/2019,No-deal Brexit budget is now only option on Donohoe's table,"In one way, Boris Johnson's tactics have made things more straightforward for the Government. Britain's prime minister doesn't want to reach any compromise deal on the Border backstop - and so there is no decision for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his Cabinet to make, and nothing on the table which might give them an awkward decision to make. If Johnson is playing the tactic of making unreasonable demands, blaming the European Union and Ireland for not agreeing and then calling a general election after the House of Commons blocks the move to a no-deal exit, then there is precisely nothing we can do about this. But while this removes one strategic question for the Government, it creates a few others. A no-deal exit is far from a racing certainty, but it is clearly an increasing threat. Our political debate needs to wake up to this no-deal threat and the economic shock which could be coming at the end of October. Planning on this basis is far from ideal - a no-deal Brexit may yet be avoided. But to ignore the risk now would clearly be ludicrous.  Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will likely be presenting his budget for 2020 in early October with a no-deal threat hanging over us, but still no clarity. A potentially crucial EU summit takes place shortly after the likely budget date. There doesn't seem much point in delaying the budget. For now, we will have to assume a no-deal Brexit and just get on with it. If it turns out otherwise, then so much the better.  So the debate about the budget needs to turn on its head. Instead of arguing about how we distribute the fruits of growth, we need to look at protecting what we have. Forget the talk about tax cuts and EUR 5 a week for all welfare payments. Forget plans for giveaways which might play well ahead of a general election - national or local. Forget the usual parade of Ministers dropping not-so-veiled hints that their patch is in line for a few extra bob. Given the uncertainty Donohoe is likely to face - not only about whether a no-deal Brexit is about to happen, but also about exactly what it would mean, there is a strong case for him doing very little in the budget itself. There will be a need to prepare help for the sectors most exposed - and the Minister could use the budget to signal his plans and perhaps even get the appropriate spending approvals from the Dáil.  Flexibility will be essential. The size of the economic hit from a no-deal Brexit is debatable - and a lot of it may take place in rural Ireland. The wider impact will depend on business and consumer confidence, always hard to forecast. But a few key sectors stand exposed, notably the beef industry and some other parts of the food sector which would face delays, bureaucracy and in some cases sky-high tariffs selling into the UK market.  State-aid clearances  An immediate threat to farm incomes and to the future of a large part of the beef sector would present itself. Behind the scenes, the Government is developing a plan here, though this will need the appropriate state-aid clearances in Brussels. If a no-deal happens, bailing out the beef sector is going to be one of the biggest stories. In presenting his outline plans for the budget recently, Donohoe said that a no-deal would mean acceptance that the exchequer would move from an expected small surplus next year into a deficit. This is because economic growth - and thus tax revenue - would be lower and there would be new demands on spending.  Sensibly, the Government does not plan to slash and burn other spending or hike taxes to try to keep the books balanced in the face of what could be a sharp hit to growth. But equally it would be stupid to pretend that normal transmission can continue, either, or that it is in any way useful to spend the next few months arguing about spending extra cash which we may not have, or making tax cuts we cannot afford. Forecasts vary quite significantly on how serious a hit could come from a no-deal Brexit. Official Department of Finance estimates - not by any means the most pessimistic - see a threat over time to 50,000 jobs and a EUR 6.5 billion swing in 2020 in the budget sums. If more pessimistic Central Bank forecasts are correct, the hit could conceivably be greater. But by far the greater - and more significant - uncertainty is what happens after a no-deal. On one theory, such would be the upheaval to the UK economy that whoever was in government would quickly come back seeking a deal with the EU. However, who knows? Brexit will, without any doubt, make the UK considerably poorer over time than it would have been. But who knows how hard and chaotic the initial hit will be. A lengthy stand-off between the UK and EU after a no-deal could also occur, deepening the economic cost not only in the UK but also in Ireland. Johnson's election also surely increases this risk. There are opportunities for us, too, of course. Certainly in terms of a stable country in which to invest, Ireland looks a better bet right now than the UK. But in the short term the building uncertainty is sure to take a toll. The Government will most likely wait until September to make a call, but budgeting for a no-deal Brexit now seems the only way forward. This risks hitting business and consumer confidence - and will be politically very tricky - but having to adjust the budget plans suddenly after a no-deal takes place would be much, much worse.",1,trade,,,,,ireland
293,Irish Independent,18/11/2013,Coalition tension grows over tough budgets; Parties at odds over cutting debt with future growth levels uncertain,"TENSIONS are emerging in the Coalition over the postbailout plan for the economy, where more difficult budgetary targets will be set, the Irish Independent has learnt. Several tough budgets lie ahead as the Government plans to stop borrowing completely within the next five years and chip away at our huge debt. The country's heavy debt burden remains a concern on the international markets. Next month, the Government will reveal its plans to eliminate borrowing in order to prove it can be trusted to manage the public finances beyond the bailout. The central plank of the plan involves bringing the level of annual borrowing down to zero. Targets But there are differences between the Government parties over the commitments to be included in the plan and how quickly they have to be achieved. Fine Gael figures believe the elimination of borrowing has to be done ""over a reasonable period of time"" and have pencilled in 2017 to 2018 as the timeframe. But Labour Party sources said those types of details have still to be worked out and there is no agreement yet on the exact targets. The junior coalition party doesn't want to attach rigid targets that leave little room for flexibility if there is not the necessary level of growth in the economy. ""In some circumstances, zero is easy. If you have large rates of growth, steady increases in employment and no external factors working against you, then fine. But it's a very theoretical model. ""A zero target in isolation is a very blinkered view of the world,"" a senior government source said. The specific targets up to the end of the decade will be set in a new 'Mid-Term Economic Outlook' being prepared by the Government. The Government wants to prove to the international markets that its commitment to repair the public finances will continue, even without the troika's supervision. The vast bulk of the plan is agreed in principle and will involve continuing to reduce the deficit, while driving on with reforms in banking, the professions, health and utilities. The plan for economic policy up to 2020 is to reassure the markets the country will not return to a cycle of so-called 'boom and bust economics'. ""They want us to convince the public and prove to ourselves this will never happen again. ""That's the goal,"" a government source said. Next year, the country will run a primary surplus, which means the taxes collected will exceed expenditure - but only when interest rate payments on debt are excluded. The step after that is a budget surplus, even when debt repayments are included. The government plan will go beyond the tight budgetary rules set down by the EU, setting out what will happen each year. The budget deficit already has to be reduced to 3pc of economic output by 2015, as pledged under the bailout programme. Benefits But the Coalition will then seek to direct the benefits of growth in 2016 towards reducing debt, rather than spending increases and tax cuts. The plan will set out how to bring the structural deficit down to zero by 2017 or 2018 to stop borrowing completely. The credit ratings agency Moody's said exiting the bailout without a backstop is not influencing its view of Ireland. Instead, whether Ireland can reduce its debt - expected to peak at 124pc of gross domestic product this year - is really the ""key factor"" for the firm. Moody's analyst Yves Lemaysaid what will inform its view is ""clear evidence"" of sustainable growth and recurring budgetary surpluses that would bring down the level of debt. ""It''s important to remind ourselves that the country is still shouldering a very high debt burden. That certainly informs our view on the rating level.""",1,fiscal,brexit,,,,ireland
1269,Irish Independent,02/07/2018,Taxpayers down (EURO)1.8bn as volatile markets hit banks,"THE State's holdings in Irish banks have had (EURO)1.8bn wiped off them this year. The Government has lost (EURO)1.66bn in value from its holding in AIB, (EURO)45m from its holding in Bank of Ireland, and (EURO)109m from its holding in Permanent TSB. The fall in share prices has come with the markets facing an extended period of volatility. Concerns over a potential global trade war, a new populist government in Italy, and the outcome of Britain's departure from the European Union are all causing uncertainty. The Government will not see a return of the money sunk into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, but it is hoping to ultimately recoup the taxpayers' money it put into AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB. However, that prospect seems more distant as the current geopolitical climate causes headaches for market participants. In addition, Irish economic growth is expected to slow in the years ahead, and the Central Bank is reportedly about to ask banks to hold on to more capital to guard against excessive lending. Both of those factors will put downward pressures on banks' ability to grow and may impact the value placed on them by the market. The Government has said it will use the proceeds from the sale of the stakes to reduce Ireland's debt. The State is heavily indebted and despite the recent economic recovery, the Government still plans to run a deficit - meaning spending will exceed income - in the next Budget. Ultra-low interest rates have made it easier for Ireland to borrow and refinance existing debt at cheaper rates. But that is set to become more difficult with interest rates poised to shift upwards. The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates a number of times this year, while the European Central Bank is unwinding a massive stimulus programme and has said it will consider lifting rates at some point after the summer of next year. The State owns 71pc of AIB, which has lost (EURO)2.32bn from its market value this year. It is down (EURO)3.16bn on the point near the end of January when it reached the highest level since being floated by the Government. Using that figure, the taxpayer is down (EURO)2.24bn. Bank of Ireland is down around (EURO)325m this year which, when taking the State's 14pc stake into account, translates into a loss of (EURO)45m. The State owns 75pc of Permanent TSB, which is dwarfed by the other two banks. It has lost (EURO)145m in value in 2018, with the taxpayer down (EURO)109m. Asked in the Dáil in February about his approach to selling the shares, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said: ""Officials in my department continue to monitor the performance of the banks, their share prices and equity markets more generally to determine the next sensible opportunity to realise value from our investments. ""It is important to point out that exiting our investments in a measured way that will optimise value for our citizens, will take a number of years, but I do not propose to set out a rigid timeline for disposal. To do so would potentially impact the value we can achieve. ""However, I believe that over the medium term we will recoup all of the money that we invested in these banks during the financial crisis."" Mr Donohoe said that in order for a sale to go ahead he would ""need to be satisfied that the market was prepared to put a fair and reasonable value on the bank's equity, bearing in mind its current performance, future prospects and the outlook for the economy"". He said he would do this on the advice of officials. Mr Donohoe noted also that, as part of the programme for government, Fine Gael had agreed not to sell more than 25pc of any bank before the end of 2018.

1245,The Irish Times,07/06/2008,Taoiseach intensifies campaign to reverse Lisbon slide,"TAOISEACH BRIAN Cowen is to intensify his campaigning efforts in the final days before the Lisbon Treaty referendum in an effort to reverse the dramatic shift in public opinion to the No side revealed in the latest Irish Times/TNS mrbi opinion poll. STEPHEN COLLINS& MARK HENNESSYreport Mr Cowen will make as many public appearances as possible and undertake a series of media interviews in the coming days in an effort to convince voters that it is overwhelmingly in Ireland's economic interest to vote Yes. Government sources said yesterday that the poll has had the effect of galvanising the Fianna Fáil organisation and Mr Cowen has let it be known that every party TD and councillor in the country will be expected to deliver the vote as if their own seats depended on it. ""It's back to old-style politics and getting the vote out. This is vitally important for the country and we know now that it is down to Fianna Fáil to get its own people out and let the other parties look after their own responsibilities,"" said one senior Government strategist. While the leaders of the three main Dáil parties, Mr Cowen, Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore, will go ahead with plans to make a joint appeal on Monday, the Taoiseach's emphasis will be on his own campaign to turn the tide by polling day. Campaigning in Galway yesterday, Mr Cowen said the referendum next Thursday was critically important as it would send a signal to Europe about Ireland's intentions that would have very important economic implications for the country. ""The European market is on our doorstep. If we send a negative signal, I'm afraid it will be very confusing to those with whom we want to increase our trade and investment,"" said the Taoiseach, who expressed confidence that the treaty would be approved, in spite of the poll result. ""I am not contemplating defeat. I am working for a victory, and I believe that we will have it,"" he said. He added that voters faced the choice of sending a positive signal about this country or taking a step back and creating a degree of uncertainty about the future direction of the EU and Ireland's place in it. Declan Ganley, the chairman of Libertas, which is spending EUR 1.3 million on the No campaign, responded to the poll by saying that the referendum result still hung in the balance. Saying that the five-point lead for the No side ""should be taken with a grain of salt"", he added: ""There are five full days of campaigning still to go in this campaign, and the referendum is still there for the taking by either side."" Mr Ganley maintained that the Yes side was losing the battle of ideas and he added: ""If they try and make it a battle of personalities they will lose that too."" French president Nicolas Sarkozy urged a Yes vote as he visited Athens yesterday in preparation for France assuming the EU presidency next month. ""Of all European countries, Ireland is one of those which has been able most magnificently to adapt to the European Union,"" said Mr Sarkozy. ""I hope that the Irish understand the extremely important issues at stake for them and for us."" Former EU commissioner Peter Sutherland said Ireland was facing the ""most crucial decision in international affairs in its history"".",0,,public debt,,,,
233,The Irish Times,28/10/2004,Central Bank calls for caution in Budget,"The Minister for Finance, Mr Cowen, would risk damaging the Republic's competitiveness if he delivered an overly generous Budget in December, the Central Bank has warned. The caution came as the Bank slightly raised its growth forecasts in its latest quarterly bulletin but pointed to considerable risks to the economy over the next year. The Central Bank's assistant director general, Dr Michael Casey, yesterday called on the Minister to take a ""neutral stance"" in the Budget to avoid stimulating too much demand in the economy and spurring inflation. 20041028005250 This would involve modest spending growth of about 7 per cent, coupled with the indexation of personal tax bands to inflation. Dr Casey said that, while this would keep the public finances in balance by avoiding a large deficit, it would not equate to a ""restrictive"" budget. ""When the economy is firing on all cylinders, it wouldn't be desirable to add to demand pressures in the economy,"" he said, calling for a ""prudent, cautious"" Budget. He said a small surplus might be desirable in 2005, warning that any significant deficit would be ""dangerous in these times of deteriorating competitiveness and rapid growth"". One such danger could be that reduced competitiveness could ""frighten off"" multinationals that are considering an investment in the Republic, according to Dr Casey. The Bank expects the economy to post 4.5 per cent growth in gross national product (GNP) this year, up from a previous forecast of 4.25 per cent. A further increase to 5 per cent is projected for 2005, although the forecasts are tempered with a number of health warnings. Oil looms large on this list of potential threats to economic growth, with the Bank warning that each $10 (EUR 7.87) increase in the cost of a barrel of oil could knock half a percentage point off growth and add the same measure to inflation. Oil prices have stayed above $50 for the past three weeks and have climbed by about 65 per cent since the start of the year. The Central Bank's forecasts are based on oil prices of slightly more than $40. The Bank also voiced concerns over the domestic labour market, particularly in the construction sector. Dr Casey pointed out that some 30,000 workers are currently engaged in building houses, noting that these workers will need to be employed elsewhere when the house-building boom concludes. While the Bank is expecting a ""soft landing"" in this regard, Dr Casey said the economic effect of this outflow of jobs remains uncertain. He urged the Government to stick ""rigidly"" to the terms of the Sustaining Progress national wage agreement in all sectors as the economy begins to fulfil its growth potential again. In these ""tight"" circumstances, spiralling wage demands must be avoided, Dr Casey said. ""Drift would be quite damaging,"" he said, referring to the 5.5 per cent wage increase that Sustaining Progress provides over 18 months. The Bank expects inflation to average about 2.25 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 2005. Dr Casey welcomed the latest indications of a softening in growth rate in house prices, adding that recent indications of falling rents may act as a ""cautionary tale"" to those seeking to enter the buy-to-let market. He believes that house prices will probably increase by 5-6 per cent next year, before flattening towards the end of the decade. The Bank reiterated earlier warnings that sustained growth in house prices of 10 per cent or more would make a property crash more likely.",0,,,,,,
722,The Irish Times,06/08/2018,Hoteliers oppose VAT rise in budget," A mooted Government move to single out hotels for an increase in the special lower VAT rate would be ""absolutely incredible"" and would undermine the sector, industry groups have said. The possible move has also been sharply criticised by individual hoteliers, including Des O'Dowd, the owner of the Inchydoney Island resort in west Cork who was recently appointed by the Government to the board of Fáilte Ireland, the State tourism development agency. The Irish Times reported on Saturday that the hotel sector is expected to be targeted by the Government for an increase in the special lower 9 per cent VAT rate in the October budget. Under proposals being strongly considered, the full 13.5 per cent VAT rate would be restored only for businesses that sell ""accommodation"", such as hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfasts. Other businesses that avail of the lower rate - restaurants, cafes, hairdressers, newspapers and entertainment services - would keep the 9 per cent rate.  Economic 'deadweight' Last week, a Department of Finance report emerged that described the special VAT rate as an economic ""deadweight"" and suggested it had cost the exchequer EUR 2.6 billion since 2011. Mr O'Dowd said he was concerned by the ""discourse"" that has emerged around describing the rate as a ""cost"" to the exchequer.  He said the tax take from the tourism sector had risen significantly since its introduction. ""The rate of VAT on hotel accommodation annoys people because they feel they're being overcharged by Dublin hotels,"" said Mr O'Dowd. ""So there is very little public empathy there. It is very frustrating as an owner/operator to see the consequences of [the Dublin issue] dominate all public discourse and potentially Government policy."" Michael Lennon, president of the Irish Hotels Federation, said the 9 per cent rate was the ""right rate for the sector"".  ICTU welcome ""At a time of serious economic uncertainty around Brexit, it absolutely incredible to suggest that the Government would undermine the hotel sector and impose hundreds of millions in additional taxes on tourists and visitors, and make us less attractive for visitors,"" he said in a statement.  Mr Lennon also said that while tourism businesses had ""achieved a return to growth in recent years, not every tourism business is enjoying the same level of success"". The Irish Congress of Trade Union said the idea was ""welcome progress"" in its campaign to restore the full 13.5 per cent rate. ",0,,,,,,

Considerable uncertainty remains, however, about the terms on which he will take the job. EU Finance Ministers, meeting yesterday, recommended that 11 member-states - Ireland included - participate in the single currency. The heads of government will confirm this at today's summit meeting. 98050200002 The contest between Mr Duisenberg, who heads the European Monetary Institute and the French central bank governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, for the key job of managing the single currency has threatened to overshadow the announcement of the participants. The Minister for Finance, Mr McCreevy, joined others in warning that the markets would not take kindly to failure. ""It is better for everyone to give certainty - markets thrive on uncertainty,"" he said. Speculation still centres on a splitting of the eight-year term of the presidency, although the President of the Commission, Mr Jacques Santer, yesterday made clear such a deal could not be a formal agreement without undermining the treaty. While Mr Duisenberg is reported to be willing to give an informal undertaking not to serve his full term he, the Dutch and the Germans would have considerable problems if the time-frame was specified. The German Finance Minister, Mr Theo Waigel, said a ""positive and credible"" solution would be found before the close of the summit. The French European Affairs Minister, Mr Pierre Moscovici, said in Paris that France wanted a de facto split in the term of the presidency and that it wanted its man in place for the launch of the euro notes and coins in 2002. Describing the meeting as ""the most important meeting of EU Finance Ministers that there has been"", the British Chancellor and president of the Finance Council, Mr Gordon Brown, said the recommendation represented ""not the end of a process but the beginning of a new era in Europe"".

Mr Noonan said the Government's focus was on ensuring Ireland's exit from the EU-IMF bailout programme was successful and durable.  ""The budget will include fiscal targets that will ensure we can finance the State in the normal manner from financial markets,'' he added. ""It will continue the improvement in the public finances by further reducing the deficit towards the 3 per cent target in 2015 and placing the State's debt on a downward trajectory.'' For next year, he said, the Government had agreed the budget would bring the deficit down to 4.8 per cent of GDP. ""This will be significantly below the 5.1 per cent deficit target.'' ""The Government, on my advice, took the view that we needed to have a deficit in the high fours so as to show that a 3 per cent deficit is attainable in 2015 and that we have a sufficient buffer in the event of international shocks.''Uncertainty Mr Noonan said the other reason for a 4.8 per cent deficit was that the Government wanted to make sure that the fiscal adjustment was finished by 2015. The longer the adjustment took meant the greater uncertainty that would hang over the economy.  ""And uncertainty will cause people to defer investment and spending decisions, which is the last thing we need now that the recovery in the labour force is taking hold,'' he said.

309,Irish Independent,25/04/2020,"Confinement: fear of death, the price of life and the risk of living; SATURDAY INSIGHT Laurent Muzellec","THE Covid-19 pandemic is a tragedy that has already killed thousands around the globe. Governments, on the advice of medical staff and with the support of their citizens, have ordered a lockdown to slow the transmission of the virus. This measure, the only one possible in the absence of systematic testing, has been effective in reducing the death toll. Confinement as a temporary emergency measure made sense to ""flatten the curve"". Some countries have started to lift the lockdown but according to a recent Harvard study, it may be necessary to have periods of confinement until 2022. Maybe now is the time to calmly review the situation and discuss the merits of a prolonged confinement in the context of all of society, including future generations. First, let us have a look at the present and future economic costs that those restrictions are imposing. During the lockdown, countries are reportedly functioning at 60pc of their capacity. According to the European Commission, this translates into a reduction of 10pc in gross domestic product (GDP) for the eurozone for 2020. In comparison, eurozone GDP only shrank by 4.5pc in the last major financial crisis in 2009. This economic crisis is already being compared to the 1929 crash. Companies are going bankrupt at an unprecedented rate and the unemployment rate in the USA is already at 16pc. Similar figures or worse are expected across Europe. This is the situation as of today and it worsens for every week the lockdown is prolonged. We could argue that this economic slowdown has some benefits. Aside from spending time with our families, we are experiencing what the world would feel like with fewer cars and less pollution. Pictures of wild animals re-entering lost territories are populating social media and we can only rejoice at those scenes. But governments are spending billions in an attempt to mitigate the economic crisis. Budget deficits are predicted to reach 10pc to 15pc of GDP for countries in the eurozone. Ultimately, those deficits will be added to national debts. France's debt pile will likely soar to 115pc of GDP, Italy's to 150pc. Fiscal measures in Europe alone should add up to (EURO)1.5 trillion this year. With quantitative easing by central banks, developed countries may limit the damage. In simple terms, central banks are issuing new money to buy debts generated by their respective governments. This money is used to help people and companies during this difficult period. In a few years, the debt that is not owned by anyone but the central banks and can simply be erased. Nobody can predict the effect of this monetary sleight of hand. At the minimum, it should result in hefty inflation and a significant lowering of the standard of living of the population in years to come. In addition, most of the debt will not be erased and the burden of this crisis will be passed on to our children. To summarise, the price of this collapse will not be paid by the generation that is more likely to die from the virus (the average age of people dying from the coronavirus in France, for example, is 81), it will be paid by the current and future workforce - our children. Ironically, in countries such as the USA, France and Germany, the older generation most affected by the virus had a better standard of living than any previous generation before them and very likely than any generation after them. In comparison, the crisis and associated measures taken by governments will be paid for by future generations whose destiny already seemed very uncertain. All of this reveals a contradiction and an obsession. The contradiction is that usually we accept many risks and deaths in order to live the way we live. The World Health Organisation estimates that pollution kills 4.2 million people every year. Around 1.35 million people die in road crashes each year. Harmful use of alcohol kills 2.5 million along with another 6 million people from tobacco, including a few hundred thousand from secondhand smoke exposure. Annual influenza epidemics result in 500,000 deaths worldwide. Yet, pollution is widely tolerated, tobacco, alcohol and cars are not only legal but also legally advertised The generation at risk of Covid-a better standard living than any and nobody really seems to care about the flu. In comparison, the measures taken to avoid the spread of the coronavirus - which so far has killed ""only"" 190,000 people - have jeopardized our way of life and the well-being of future generations. The obsession is that life should be preserved at all cost. Financial cost, but also maybe at the cost of living our lives with the most basic human rights and dignity. Freedom of movement has been suspended and tomorrow movements may be digitally tracked through our mobile phones. As temporary measures, they may be acceptable. More fundamentally, in many western societies, this obsession for life as opposed to living means that death is taboo. It is associated with the prolonging of life at any cost. Confinement is not a sustainable way of living and yet even stricter measures have been imposed for people over 70. Confinement also means dying alone, without the human decency of a proper family goodbye and burial. Is it really worth living in those conditions in order to survive another week, another month, at best a few more years? Surely, it is up to the individuals concerned to decide for themselves. I know that many will argue that our way of living prior to Covid-19 was not sustainable. I share the hope that this will give the impetus for us to change our way of living for a better future for our children. However, we need to stop dreaming that human nature is going to change dramatically within a few months. As if our society is going to become more altruistic and capitalism more human just because of a pandemic. If 30pc unemployment becomes the norm, social unrest rather than social harmony may be a more likely outcome. So where does all this leave us? People who are the most vulnerable should protect themselves and should be protected to the best of our abilities. Every single one of us should behave in a way that is mindful of others. Individuals should take responsibility for themselves, for their parents, and for their children. The voices of doctors, to whom we are incredibly indebted, have been heard: we know that the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are at risk today. But as the dire consequences of a prolonged confinement are becoming clearer, maybe other voices should also be heard - the sociologists, civil society, economists, to name a few but not all. We need to face the very difficult decisions that need to be taken. Whether we collectively decide to go on with confinement, we need to take stock of the consequences from multiple perspectives. Maybe now is the time for our western democracies to truly debate these issues to decide our present and our future.

1204,Irish Independent,24/11/2010,State to take control of banks as fears deepen new onslaught,"Drastic plan as the euro faces  URGENT action to keep the banks afloat will be taken within 72 hours, it emerged last night.  The current crisis will force the Government to inject hundreds of millions in new capital into the banks, leaving the State with majority ownership -- effectively nationalising AIB and Bank of Ireland. The drastic measures were seen as inevitable following a plunge in shares, negative market reaction to the bailout and a deepening crisis for the euro.  High-level talks were continuing last night about pumping extra cash into the banks before the weekend.  Shares in AIB have plunged 73pc so far this year. That means investors value the entire bank, including all its branches and deposits, at just EUR357m. At its peak, it was valued at around EUR22bn. Shares in the bank closed at just 33c last night -- a long way from their peak of EUR23.95 in February 2007.  Bank of Ireland's share price tumbled to a record low of 25c before closing at 30c last night. That means its value was EUR1.59bn -- less than a tenth of its value in the boom.  News of the urgent new action over the banks came as embattled Taoiseach Brian Cowen faced the wrath of his TDs last night, and as Ireland was accused of jeopardising the very future of the euro.  After another day of deep political uncertainty in Dublin, the markets reacted badly to the State's economic and political crisis.  In Greece, the government was told it would get the next part of its EUR110bn bailout package on time, but it was warned by the IMF it must make extra efforts to meet next year's deficit targets.  Spain's borrowing costs jumped yesterday as the jitters over Ireland spread, prompting investors to ignore Madrid's progress towards meeting its deficit targets.  Last night, Mr Cowen listened to about four hours of debate among ministers and backbench Fianna Fail TDs at a parliamentary party meeting.  At the closed-door meeting the Taoiseach made a passionate address in which he made it clear he would stay on as leader of Fianna Fail and would not be quitting before an election -- as demanded by some party rebels.  Blame  Some TDs laid the blame for the party's woes and the growing political vacuum at Mr Cowen's door.  Veteran TD Mary O'Rourke urged members to ""throw their hats in the ring"" in January. Serial rebels, including former junior minister John McGuinness and TD Maire Hoctor, called on Mr Cowen to go after the Budget on December 7.  The meeting came as the ripple effects of Ireland's turbulent EUR90bn bailout and escalating political crisis continued to reverberate across Europe.  The Government's four-year plan, including slashing EUR1bn off the public sector pay bill, will be published today as European Finance Commissioner Ollie Rehn starkly warned Ireland it must ensure the Budget is passed.  He said: ""Every day that is lost increases uncertainty and increases the economic and social cost. So please let's adopt the Budget, let's get it out of the way and let's move on.""  The Budget deadline is a key proviso in talks with the European Community and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ease the risk of the crisis spreading to economically weak euro countries such as Portugal and Spain.

1200,Irish Independent,04/01/2018,State pulls in highest ever amount of tax with a record (EURO)50bn,"THE tax take for last year reached a record high of just over (EURO)50bn. The State took in (EURO)2.87bn more in taxes last year than had been initially expected. The figures were further boosted by the one-off sale of AIB shares, according to the Exchequer Returns published last night. The State's tax income is now 60pc above the 2010 low point. However, last year's gains in income were offset by spending increases, resulting in a deficit in 2017 when the (EURO)3.4bn AIB shares windfall is stripped out. The tax take for last year was slightly above target or profile, with (EURO)50.737bn collected. That compares with (EURO)47.86bn in 2016, which surpassed the previous peak in 2007. An Exchequer surplus of almost (EURO)2bn was recorded for 2017, but that primarily reflects proceeds from the sale for (EURO)3.4bn of more than 28pc of the State's stake in AIB. An underlying deficit of around (EURO)1.5bn, was recorded, when the AIB shares windfall is excluded. The latest figures show income tax receipts of (EURO)1.726bn were collected in December, coming in (EURO)15m above profile for the month. This equates to a 6.3pc increase compared to December 2016. But, that number is 1.2pc below where they had been expected to be for the year. VAT receipts, a key measure of activity in the domestic economy as well as a source of revenue for the Government, came in 0.5pc below target for the year at (EURO)13.3bn. Even so, the VAT receipts were up 7.1pc compared with December 2016. Cumulative tax revenues of (EURO)50.737bn were collected in 2017, an increase of 6pc on 2016. However that doesn't include the likes of PRSI, in reality another big source of State income. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe (inset) said the figures showed a ""very solid performance and clearly underscores the improving economy"". He said the underlying deficit was around (EURO)1.5bn. ""This fiscal out-turn provides a good platform to start 2018,"" Mr Donohoe said. ""However, we remain vigilant to the potential challenges we face, including Brexit."" Davy Stockbrokers said the Government was now within ""touching distance"" of a budget surplus. ""We expect the deficit to equal 0.3pc of GDP in 2017, falling to 0.2pc in 2018,"" said Davy economist David McNamara. ""One concern is the increased reliance on corporation tax, now accounting for 16pc of tax revenues and driving much of the tax outperformance. The volatility of corporation tax adds uncertainty to the Government's revenue base as demographic and infrastructure pressures significantly add to spending in the coming years."" Meanwhile, bond investors piled in to be among lenders to the State yesterday, as the Government borrowed (EURO)4bn on the bond markets. Total orders placed by wouldbe investors topped (EURO)14bn, helping keep the yield - or effective interest rate for the State - at 0.94pc. It means in effect the State is paying an interest bill of less than 1pc a year to borrow over 10 years. The deal means that roughly a quarter of the NTMA's total 2018 borrowing target, which it said is between (EURO)14bn and (EURO)18bn, has already been reached.",0,,,,,,
412,Irish Independent,27/07/2013,Dust down your hairshirt - report is softening us up for more cuts,"IF we thought there was a chance of an easier Budget this year, then forget it. That was the message from the Central Bank yesterday, which made clear it believes the Government should push ahead with more austerity. Last year, Finance Minister Michael Noonan committed to taking some (EURO)3.1bn out of the economy in October's Budget through a mixture of spending cuts and tax hikes. However, after the former Anglo Irish Bank was shut down in February as part of the infamous ""promissory note deal"", it was hoped the (EURO)1bn-a-year savings achieved would allow a less harsh adjustment. It was an illusion the Government was happy to allow to fester. But now the Central Bank has come down in no uncertain terms against such a move. For the Central Bank, the language is about as Michael Noonan uncompromising as it gets: an easier Budget should be ""resisted"", while a full programme of cuts will be a ""valuable key in maintaining the confidence of international lenders"". In layman's terms, that means that if we want to successfully exit our international bailout programme this year and regain our economic sovereignty, we need to keep our foot firmly on the austerity pedal. Is that the right way to go, though? While one foot is on the austerity pedal, another is firmly placed on people's throats as they grapple with unemployment, wage cuts and bleak prospects for their children. It is easy for economists to look at the numbers and insist austerity is the only option, but unemployment remains over 13pc. Youth unemployment is about double that. Can we really take more austerity? On the one hand, we should probably be pleased that the Central Bank has done this. A few years back, as the boom was coming to a shuddering halt, we were constantly fed the idea that the economy would have a ""soft landing"". It was a view that nobody in the Central Bank questioned. Six hairshirt Budgets later we know where that got us. The Central Bank's pronouncements give Mr Noonan political cover in a number of ways. As important, though, was the timing of the Central Bank's report. This is the last one before the Budget. That means it can't roll back on its forecasts, but it also gives us just enough time to digest its findings. Markets, and most people, hate nasty surprises. If we didn't know it before, we definitely know it now: time to get those hairshirts out again and hope for the best. Graphic   Michael Noonan",0,,,,,,
1199,The Irish Times,30/07/2021,State plan to borrow more to ease housing crisis is unwise,"The Government's summer economic statement reflected a political compromise, changing the planned stance of fiscal policy over the course of this Dáil.  It was obviously framed in the context of considerable uncertainty about the nature of the economic recovery that is under way but, from what we now know, the planned relaxation of borrowing constraints out to 2025 looks unwise. The main change in planned Government expenditure is due to an increased provision for investment in housing. However, the housing supply problem remains the same as it has been for the past few years - the ability of the construction sector to deliver the desired output.  At a time when private buyers, from their pent-up savings, are likely to be spending more, an increased injection of Government housing funds runs the risk of further pushing up house prices, with more money chasing sluggish housing output. This could replicate some of the problems of the 2000s when an ambitious government investment programme was layered on top of a boom in private-sector investment.  This time around, Central Bank action will prevent a knock-on shock to the financial system, but won't keep the lid on house prices. Last week, the Central Statistics Office published the latest savings data. This shows that from the onset of the pandemic up to the end of March this year, households have built up exceptional savings of about EUR 27 billion, equivalent to 13 per cent of adjusted gross national income. With continuing restrictions, this had probably reached EUR 30 billion by the end of June.  The Department of Finance's economic forecasts assume about a quarter of these exceptional savings will be spent in 2022 on consumer goods and services and on increased expenditure on housing.  This would see a temporary boom in the economy, though still not sufficient to restore full employment by the end of next year. However, it is possible that more of these savings could be spent, which would add both to growth and to construction demand, intensifying the pressures on the building sector in 2022 and 2023. In planning for the next few years, much more attention needs to be paid to matching the stance of fiscal policy to the needs of the economy.  Excess demand  If there is an unexpectedly rapid recovery in the economy, and output reaches capacity in 2022 or 2023, the Government will need to run a surplus, to absorb the excess demand that the economy cannot deliver on. This could mean moving into surplus through either holding back on expenditure or raising taxation.  It is only if the economy continues to display unused capacity in 2023 and 2024 that the planned deficit could be justified.  While the primary need to provide for such a surplus is about preventing overheating, not about the size of the national debt, the impact of a potential future rise in interest rates needs to be taken into account.  Looking to the end of the decade, however, Ireland faces a series of challenges which will require higher public expenditure, not just on housing. Last year, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council estimated that the increasing health and education costs of ageing will exceed the normal fiscal space available each year after 2025.  Just to keep services at their then current level will require higher taxes or cuts elsewhere.  The Department of Health has just published its estimates of the likely capacity required in disability services up to 2032, highlighting the impact of demographic change and of unmet needs. Earlier this week the Economic and Social Research Institute published research which highlights the cost implications of implementing Sláintecare - an NHS-type comprehensive health service.  Layering this on top of the needs of an ageing population and housing requirements will call for a further permanent increase in the level of public expenditure.  In addition, the costs of tackling climate change after 2025 will probably require further investment of 1.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent of national income. While some of this additional expenditure could be carried by households, this may prove difficult to implement without causing hardship to those on low incomes. Instead, that much of that bill is likely to fall to the government. Faced with these multiple challenges it would not be feasible to free up sufficient resources through cuts in expenditure. Further borrowing, at a time when interest rates may have normalised, will certainly not be the answer.  If we want decent public services that address the demographic and other challenges, the tax take will need to rise to pay for them. Ideally, such taxation would be broad-based, where society as a whole which benefits from better public services contributes to their cost.",0,,,,,,
242,Irish Independent,15/07/2016,Central Bank holds talks with firms on Brexit fallout,"THE Central Bank will publish revised economic forecasts later this month in the wake of the Brexit vote. Financial Regulator Cyril Roux and other officials held talks with financial sector representatives yesterday about the potential consequences for the sector, following the outcome of the referendum held in the UK on June 23. Mr Roux said the purpose of the engagement was to allow the sector to present their views on the impacts for the regulated financial sector. ""Prior to and since the referendum, the bank has been in close contact with the firms it supervises, as well as the Irish Government, ECB-SSM and other EU institutions, and continues to monitor carefully developments in the financial markets and on the regulated financial services providers,"" the Central Bank said in a statement. Last month, Central Bank Governor Philip Lane said forecasts would be revised, and he warned of uncertainty for some time. The Central Bank said the revised outlook would be published in the Quarterly Bulletin later in the month. ""The bank is confident that the contingency measures in place are appropriate to address any such issues that may arise in the short to medium term,"" the bank added. ""In respect of firms or funds potentially seeking to locate in Ireland, the Deputy Governor said the bank remains committed to providing a clear, open and transparent authorisation process while ensuring a rigorous assessment of the applicant against regulatory standards so as to continue to ensure a high, consistent level of consumer protection."" Prof Lane said the Central Bank had prepared for the possibility of a Brexit and that it would continue to closely monitor the risks to financial stability. Meanwhile, the chief economist at the Office for National Statistics in the UK, Joe Grice, said it is ""aware"" of the appetite among economists for concrete figures on Brexit effects. ""In the short term, we won't see figures fall off a cliff - it will be a longer-term impact,"" he said. The ONS has been meeting to determine which figures can reliably be used,"" Mr Grice said.",0,,,,,,
572,The Irish Times,14/04/2018,FF backs Government on budget 'rainy day fund' as Brexit looms," Fianna Fáil is willing to consider any proposals from the Government to hold back some of the money available to the State in this year's budget, the party's deputy leader has said. Dara Calleary, recently appointed by Michéal Martin, said his party wants to ensure Ireland is protected from any economic shocks that may arise as a result of Brexit and potential international trade wars.  His comments mark a change of view within Fianna Fáil. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to have over EUR 3 billion to spend in the final budget of the confidence- and-supply deal in October. Held back  Senior Fine Gael figures believe some of this money may need to be held back because of fears of the economy overheating.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have already agreed that EUR 500 million from the next budget should be held in a so-called rainy day fund.  However, a view has hardened within the Government that even more should be held back. In a change from views previously expressed by senior figures in his party, Mr Calleary said Fianna Fáil is ""open to proposals"" on this.  ""We have achieved two budgets,"" Mr Calleary said. ""We have done it on the basis that both parties are open to proposals and open to discussions. ""The rainy day fund is our proposal and something that we are committed to. We want to ensure that we are as protected as possible.  ""Particularly in the world context of trade wars emerging, the uncertainty of Brexit, and as one of the most open economies in the world. Let them make proposals to us."" Stability  Mr Donohoe says it is his intention to again reduce the universal social charge and raise the threshold at which people pay the higher rate of income tax.  He also said he wants the confidence-and-supply deal renewed ""later in the year"".  ""I believe that when we get into 2019 stability in the con- text of what will be happening with Brexit, in particular, will be really important.""  Mr Donohoe's statement reflects a view within Fine Gael that the review of the deal underpinning the minority government will now not happen until after the budget. 'Senior figures previously wanted to open talks before the Dáil summer recess, but Mr Martin has repeatedly said the confidence-and-supply deal says the review will take place after the final budget.",1,trade,,,,,uk
396,Irish Independent,04/01/2019,Donohoe has delivered but it will get harder from now on,"HE Finance Minister has endured months of criticism for spurning the opportunity to put Ireland's finances on a more sustainable path. TNow, Paschal Donohoe can at least afford himself a wry smile after data released by the Government showed that State revenues exceeded spending for the first time since 2006, when you strip out one-off items. In fact, the surprise news was so good that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar appeared to pull a stunt from Donald Trump's playbook by preannouncing the numbers hours ahead of the official release. It is true the State's debts remain huge, and are the third-largest in the world on a per capita basis, but the turnaround in finances has been nothing short of breathtaking. In less than 10 years, Ireland has turned Europe's largest budget deficit relative to the size of the economy into a surplus. Lest we forget, in 2010, the deficit was equivalent to almost a third of economic output; now we have joined the 12 EU countries that had already posted a budget surplus in 2017. While much of the work was put in by Mr Donohoe's predecessors, Brian Lenihan and Michael Noonan, he has at least used the fair winds from a global economic recovery and rising tax revenues to make the State's finances stronger as we head into the uncertainty of Brexit. While it is true he could have done better - there was (EURO)600m in health overspending alone that was masked by the surging tax revenues - he could also have done much worse and many finance ministers have. Italy, Europe's third-largest economy, is flirting with recession and looks set for a budget row with Brussels, while France's reformist President Emmanuel Macron had to buy off the ""gilets jaunes"" protesters with spending promises that may well land Paris in the excessive deficit procedure of the EU. Britain faces years of sub-par growth and rising budget deficits if it pushes ahead with Brexit, while Trump sent the economy on a debt-fuelled sugar rush that is now coming to an end. So, yes, global growth will slow and with it the exports that have helped pull Ireland out of its slump as well as tech company tax receipts. Yes, other countries are going to tire of our low tax regime - and the smart minds in the Department of Finance are going to have to come up with other ways to raise money if the State wants world-class infrastructure, health and education services. What is impressive though is even with the difficulties of managing a coalition Government, Mr Donohoe has achieved as much as he has. He deserves praise for pushing through an end to VAT exemptions that had cost the State more than (EURO)2.5bn. Mr Donohoe may have flunked the test on carbon taxes. But in the light of the protests in France, he has perhaps shown greater understanding of what can be done at any one time.",1,geopolitical,brexit,,,,usa
1126,The Irish Times,05/11/2002,"Returns underline the economy's poor prospectsAnalysis: The only way spending can be brought within the Minister's Budget Day targets is to put a freeze on it for the rest of the year, writes Una McCaffrey","One economist described yesterday's Exchequer returns for October as ""the same story, just rolled on a month"", and it is hard to disagree. The prospects for the year continue to look glum, with the same two culprits - tax revenue and public spending - causing most concern among commentators. Both remain well off targets set on Budget Day last year. Those goals saw Government spending growing by about 14 per cent in 2002. 02110500118 At the end of October, the actual growth was just slightly less than 20 per cent. Tax revenue meanwhile - the money that pays for the spending - is shown in the latest data to have risen by 2.3 per cent in the year to date, compared to a full-year target of 8.6 per cent. It is a story that has been repeated all year, with the Minister for Finance finally recognising last month that something had to give in his forecasts. On that occasion, the publication of September's Exchequer returns, Mr McCreevy said he expected the public finances to register a deficit of €750 million for the whole year, compared to his previous projections of a small surplus. He predicted that the annual tax take would come in €1.3 billion below his initial expectations, but insisted that spending would be brought within target before the end of December. One month on, and even those more modest projections have begun to appear excessively optimistic. Mr Austin Hughes, chief economist with IIB Bank, said yesterday that a deficit of €1.2 billion was starting to look more realistic, as the inflow of tax revenue continues to lack momentum and spending remains high. In practical terms, the only way that spending can now be brought within the Minister's Budget Day targets is to put a freeze on spending for the remainder of the year. This would see some spending simply being pushed out into the early months of 2003. Such a strategy does not come with the recommendation of many economists, with most preferring to see a controlled slowdown. ""The concern to my mind is that there's no trend easing,"" said Mr Hughes last night. ""We're not seeing any sort of controlled slowdown that would tell us we're on a better footing."" As for taxation, despite some positive developments on the VAT front, it would seem difficult to achieve much improvement in the two months that stand between here and the end of this year. Bank of Ireland chief economist Dr Dan McLaughlin said a tax shortfall of €2 billion would not be surprising. Whatever the actual performance may be, Mr McCreevy is now facing into a large policy puzzle in the form of December's Budget. Dr McLaughlin says the Minister's Department has made repeated errors on budgetary forecasts over the past few years, with the current period no exception. Is there any reason to believe that 2003 will be any different? On the face of it, the prospects are not good, with this year's budgetary picture arguably a more difficult one to judge than usual. The Minister must make a guess on how the economy is going to grow in 2003, for example, a calculation rendered almost impossible by continued uncertainty about the global picture, as well as domestic conditions. And then will come the projections on tax. Behind this will be changes to the structures upon which the tax system is built. Individualisation has thrown commentators off course, for example, as have the move to a calendar tax year and changes in the rate of corporation tax. Against such a backdrop, the Economic and Social Research Institute recently recommended that a neutral Budget be adopted this year, in part so that confusion could work its way out of the system. How impressed the Minister was with this advice is unknown, but one thing is certain: it will not be the last piece of guidance he will receive between now and December 4th.",0,,public debt,,,,
1040,The Irish Times,12/04/2017,Playing the longer game; Public finances,"The latest economic forecasts from the Department of Finance highlight the difficulty of making predictions in such an uncertain world. Based on current strong economic indicators, the department is entitled to increase its growth forecast for 2017. As the document itself says, however, more than the usual level of uncertainty must surround these forecasts, given the move to Brexit and the unpredictable nature of US economic policy.  The good news is that the initial hit to economic growth following the Brexit referendum did not persist. The weakness of sterling impacted some Irish exporters but, for now, the overall momentum evident in the economy shows no sign of subsiding. However, the Brexit threat remains real, particularly over a timescale of two to three years. The annual budget process will now slowly grind into action, with the forecasts - contained in what is known as the stability programme update - presented to the Dáil budget oversight committee and also sent to the European Commission.  In a couple of months the Government will publish a Summer Economic Statement in which it will clarify the direction of its budget policy. However, one thing is now clear. The room for manoeuvre in Budget 2018 will be limited. The carry-over impact of existing spending commitments is significant. Although a full estimate of the pre-budget position will only be made in the summer statement - and a continuation of buoyant growth could improve the figures - scope for new tax cuts and extra spending will be limited. The indications in the document published yesterday are that the Government will take a cautious approach, thus trying to boost the resilience of the economy in the face of any economic shock. We must hope that this is carried through when Budget day comes and not lost in the inevitable pressure on spending in the months ahead. Lying behind all this, of course, is a high level of political uncertainty. The Taoiseach is expected to step down at some stage in the coming months. Budget policy is likely to differ, depending on who takes over. A Cabinet reshuffle is likely. And though the immediate threat of a general election over water charges appears to be receding, one can by no means be ruled out.  The Government has clearly grown more precarious over recent months. It is a poor backdrop against which to plan a budget. A report today from the National Competitiveness Council underlines the longer-term issues that need to be addressed - from boosting investment to improving competitiveness. But can we expect any real progress on these issues in the current fraught economic circumstances where short-term goals and populism appear to take precedence? Tackling these issues requires decisions to be taken with a longer-term perspective. For now, this simply does not seem possible.",1,monetary,,,,,usa
859,The Irish Times,11/12/2014,Lessons for Government; Water charges protest,"It would be a mistake for the Government to dismiss yesterday's demonstration against water charges and to believe that the worst is over in terms of public opposition. That is not to say it should either abandon the water charges or retreat into its shell for the rest of its term in office. There are important lessons to the learned for the Government and for others seeking power at the next general election. An element of guesswork is involved in interpreting the motivations of those who marched. However a few things are clear. One is the mess that was made of introducing the water charges and Irish Water itself. While the charges have been cut to a more manageable level, the Government and Irish Water now need to show that the whole structure can work and can start to address the problems in our water infrastructure.  There are wider issues, too. The Government underestimated the squeeze on household budgets and overplayed its hand in the run up to the budget. The huge increase in taxes and charges have taken their toll, together with pay cuts and, in some cases, job losses. It will be challenging to manage the economy and the national budget, particularly against the uncertainty of the international environment. But more sure-footedness and competence is surely the least we can expect. The Government has completed the job of getting the country out of the bailout, but it has so far failed to set out convincingly a new agenda after this was achieved. It has also been lacklustre in pursuing the promised agenda of political and administrative reform. The danger now is that, with its confidence hit, the Coalition loses all sense of direction as the general election approaches. The improving economy may give the Government a window to win some support back before the next election. However, it must take the opportunity. It needs to tell us what it hopes to achieve in its remaining term in office and how it plans to do so. An element of positioning by all parties is inevitable as a general election comes into view. But the priority - and responsibility - for the Government is doing its job in the meantime. ",1,regulation,future prospects,,,,ireland
1418,The Irish Times,08/08/2011,Volatility could blow any recovery off course,"ANALYSIS:The euro-zone debt crisis and US credit-rating woes could hit Irish exports and dent economic growth, writes SIMON CARSWELL,Finance Correspondent IRELAND MAY not have a central role in the latest economic drama affecting the global stage but the international volatility could radically change the plot lines of the Irish economic recovery story. The biggest threat from the turmoil stemming from the sovereign debt crisis spreading to Italy and Spain and the US loss of the top AAA credit rating, is the potential effect on Irish exports. Declining economic growth leads to declining international confidence, making companies more reluctant to invest and consumers less willing to spend. Exports have been a glimmer of hope for the economy, growing 7 per cent in the first three months of this year. The Central Bank expects them to grow by more than 6 per cent annually in 2011 and 2012. A reduction in the creditworthiness of the US will force its multinationals to pay more for their loans, which may lead companies to reconsider investments abroad. However, a weaker dollar may encourage multinationals to repatriate euro profits back to the US, the Irish Exporters Association says. Exports to the US totalled EUR 25 billion or 15 per cent of Irish exports last year, it says. Uncertainty will lead to US firms and consumers buying less.  I would be concerned about overall confidence, said Barry O Leary, chief executive of IDA Ireland, which promotes international investment into the country.  If you look at the US economy and some of the European economies, they are slowing in growth.  More than 75 per cent of all Irish exports are by multinationals in the technology/communications and life sciences industries, and it was too early to say how they would be affected by the turmoil. However, O Leary said many US multinationals were holding large reserves of cash and looking to use this to expand.  If the global economy slips back into recession, Irish exports are going to fall, said Dermot O Leary, economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers. We may relatively outperform other countries but we are trying to meet growth targets so relatives don t come into it.  The Government has forecast economic growth of 0.8 per cent in 2011 and 2.5 per cent in 2012 but any significant decline in exports would reduce these estimates. This, in turn, could affect the Government s target of getting the public finances back to a deficit of 3 per cent of GDP by 2015.  The slower the economy grows, the more savings you must find, said Alan McQuaid, chief economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers. If exports weaken, the Government may have to seek savings well beyond the EUR 3.6 billion envisaged to reduce the deficit to a target of 8.6 per cent this year. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan hinted at going beyond the EUR 3.6 billion before last week s upheaval in the markets. This could mean more severe spending cuts and higher taxes. Another difficulty of the uncertainty caused by $2.5 trillion (EUR 1.7 trillion) being wiped off global stock markets, is that Irish consumers will not want to start spending any time soon. This will also postpone a much-needed boost for the economy. On the plus side, the turmoil might lead the European Central Bank to freeze planned interest-rate increases, which will take pressure off Irish mortgage holders. Ireland could also benefit from Europe-wide solutions to ease the sovereign debt crisis, though any ECB buying of Italian bonds to reduce borrowing costs may only ease the crisis temporarily. Commentators believe an increase in the size of the European Financial Stability Facility to more than EUR 1 trillion from a proposed EUR 440 billion is the least the market expects. More far-reaching remedies such as EU bonds for debt-laden governments are unlikely given German resistance.",1,trade,water charges,,,,ireland
433,The Irish Times,20/12/2002,"Economic conditions suggest a difficult start to 2003Analysis: A combination of high inflation and low growth is worrying, writes Cliff Taylor, Economics Editor","For much of the 1990s, economic forecasters spent their time revising up their growth forecasts, as the economy went from strength to strength. Over the five years to 2000, gross national product (GNP) growth averaged almost 9 per cent a year, culminating in extraordinary GNP growth of 10.7 per cent in 2000. Now, unfortunately, the trend has reversed. The Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) have both cut their GNP growth forecasts for next year to 3 per cent - and they warned that even this might prove optimistic if international conditions do not improve. 02122000106 A striking aspect of the ESRI forecast is the prediction that the unemployment rate could top 5.5 per cent next year. This means unemployment averaging 184,000 people next year, up from 164,000 this year. The worrying aspect of the forecasts is the combination of low growth and high inflation - the ESRI expects consumer price inflation to average 5.1 per cent next year, while the Central Bank forecasts a 4.25 per cent average. The economy suffered in the mid-1970s and early 1980s from particularly damaging bouts of ""stagflation"" - a cycle of stagnant growth and high inflation. It is a particularly damaging disease as high inflation hurts competitiveness and, therefore, the low-growth period can be sustained. At the moment, the economy could not be described as stagnant - even the modest growth rates being achieved compare well by international standards. But the economists in both the Central Bank and the ESRI express concerns about the impact of relatively high inflation on competitiveness and growth. The Central Bank warns about the danger of a high inflation rate becoming entrenched in the economy. It points, as an example, to the 8.8 per cent rise in average industrial earnings per hour in the year to last June. The weakness of the euro has protected the exporting industry from competitive pressure in recent years but both sets of forecasters warn that a sharp rise in the euro could damage the high labour-intensive indigenous industry next year. The ESRI also focuses on the consequences of declining competitiveness. It points to recent employment figures, which show that ""a strong upward trend in the rate of unemployment in the private sector is emerging"". To date this has been masked by increases in public-sector job numbers. However, with the Government capping public-sector employment, the stage is set for a steady rise in unemployment, it believes. The two latest forecasts are, if anything , slightly more optimistic than the Department of Finance's Budget day prediction, which was for GNP growth of 2.2 per cent next year. The difference of less than a percentage point, however, is not particularly significant. What is important is that the main forecasting bodies are all now at one that next year will be the second year of substantially below-par growth. Just a few months ago, many forecasters had expected a stronger performance next year, with some predicting growth of 4 per cent plus. What has changed in the meantime is clear evidence that a tentative upturn in the international economy in the earlier months of this year quickly fizzled out. The crisis in US financial markets - and uncertainty over Iraq - continues to constrain investment and growth in the world's biggest economy. Meanwhile, conditions in Germany, the European Union's biggest economy, have gone from bad to worse. Most forecasters are hoping for some pick-up in the latter part of 2003. If this happens, it could provide some light at the end of the tunnel for the Irish economy, which appears to be heading for a difficult few months at the start of next year.",0,,public debt,,,,
834,The Irish Times,05/12/2011,Kenny wants to be Taoiseach who 'retrieves Irish sovereignty',"TAOISEACH ENDA Kenny said he wanted to be the Taoiseach who retrieves Ireland s sovereignty and outlined planned budgetary measures designed to create jobs, when he delivered his State of the Nation address last night. Speaking from his office in Government Buildings, the Fine Gael leader said the Irish people were not responsible for the economic crisis, but the economy remained fragile and a tough budget was in prospect. Let me say this to you all: You are not responsible for the crisis, he said. Cuts to many worthwhile projects would be implemented and while income tax would be left untouched, revenue would be raised mainly though indirect taxes, which he acknowledged would be difficult for many people.  I wish I could tell you that the Budget won t impact on every citizen in need, but I can t, Mr Kenny said. His address was broadcast on RTÉ One after the 9pm news bulletin, having been recorded as live shortly before transmission time. It was broadcast later by TV3. The long-awaited address was delivered on the eve of what is expected to be one of the toughest budgets announced in Ireland. The Government will today and tomorrow outline spending cuts and tax rises amounting to EUR 3.8 billion, as it tries to bridge the hole in the public finances. The cuts in public spending will be outlined by Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin this afternoon, while Minister for Finance Michael Noonan will set out taxation changes tomorrow when he delivers the traditional Budget Day speech. Mr Kenny last night revealed the Budget would include a series of targeted measures that he said were specifically designed to create jobs and get people back to work.  It will include, among other initiatives, a new system of loan guarantees which will enable banks to resume lending and a new microfinance scheme which will help people to start their own businesses. This will allow small firms to take on one or even two employees.  He said the State was currently spending EUR 16 billion a year more than it was taking in, and said he wanted to see the deficit under control and real growth in jobs by 2015. While the creation of jobs was at the centre of the Government s plan, he was painfully aware progress would not happen quickly enough for many people currently unemployed.  We have not so far been in a position to do everything we promised. Projects including Metro North would be postponed, he said. A referendum to abolish the Seanad would be held next year, he added. We are not able to do all we would like to in this Budget because we simply can t afford to.  Turning to the wider euro zone crisis, Mr Kenny addressed the continuing uncertainty about the future of the European single currency. He said Ireland was an island nation that could not operate in isolation. Mr Kenny pledged to work during ongoing negotiations to achieve a positive outcome for Ireland, one that ensures and protects our economic security . He called on European leaders to make and implement clear decisions this week to prove our shared determination to protect our currency , or else international confidence and investment in Europe would continue to fall. Ireland supported stronger economic governance throughout Europe, and the Irish people are paying the price now for the absence of such rules in the past . However, Mr Kenny said he felt optimistic about Ireland s future, adding that he believed that some international confidence in the State had been restored. I want to be the Taoiseach who retrieves Ireland s economic sovereignty, and who leads a Government that will help our country succeed.  Mr Kenny delivered the 10-minute address from his desk, flanked by the Irish flag and that of the EU. He described the occasion of his address as an exceptional event . Televised addresses by taoisigh are indeed rare events, with Mr Kenny s the sixth such address to take place. Ireland was on a four-year path to recovery, he said. In outlining the Government s strategy with you tonight, I do not for a moment want to make it sound simplistic or painless. It is not. ",0,,,,,,
1338,The Irish Times,31/07/2021,Three big debates loom in the autumn as economy rebounds,"Positive signals from the Government and Nphet this week about further reopening have raised hopes for autumn. The extraordinary progress of the vaccine campaign and the high levels of take-up are vital - in the first place to protect health but also to clear the way for a bounce in the economy and the public finances.  We are still looking through a fog at what lies ahead. I was struck this week by two visits to small businesses. One shop had a sign asking customers to wait for staff to come and serve them at the door, apologising for any inconvenience in this ""interim period"". And a restaurant owner I spoke to wasn't starting indoor dining for a few days because he wanted to get all the processes right. ""After all, this is probably the way it is going to be in the future,"" he added. What will be interim and what will be permanent is a big question. The idea of a UK-style ""freedom day"", where we suddenly throw away our masks and ""get back to normal"" is fanciful. But vaccination can pave the way to a wider reopening over the autumn. And this raises a few big questions about how this will happen.  Why is officialdom getting more upbeat? Look at Scotland, which has been ahead of Ireland on the vaccination - and reopening - trail.  Daily cases in Scotland, which has a similar population size to Ireland, peaked at more than 4,000 in early July, but are now in the range of 1,100-1,400 a day, similar to here. Hospitalisation and serious illness are still following cases, but at a lower level. While Ireland was lagging Scotland on vaccinations, we have now more or less caught up, with more than seven out of 10 over-18s fully vaccinated in both countries and heading towards six out of 10 of the entire population. Both look well set to be at the higher end of the international average of numbers vaccinated. The surge in cases in parts of Northern Ireland, however, and the uncertainty about what happens across the UK, show how delicate and uncertain all this is. Big debates If the vaccine wall does hold and case numbers remain contained, then we will see an economic bounce in Ireland. But it will also kick off some   really big debates about how we can - and should - live in future. The first will be the back to work debate. Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan were out this week talking up the start of the ""return to work"" in September. But a big row is coming about what this will look like.  The head of one large company said that if his staff could sit in and have a pint or a meal on a Friday night, then there was no reason why they couldn't show up to work on Monday morning. But people's lives have changed and many won't want to go back to long daily commutes. The so-called ""hybrid model"" proposed by many - a few days in the office each week and a few days out - is a bit of a halfway house and will only work for some. Does it not make more sense for people to come in to work when they need to?  The public service is as unclear as everyone else on this, with a vague plan to get people back to the office in some form between September and next March if conditions allow. Much hangs on this for our city centres - and not only for the commercial property sector. The second big debate will be the obvious one - what controls should remain. People have to produce proof of vaccination to dine indoors, or travel, but not - it seems - to go to work (unless you work in healthcare), despite the fact that some big US multinationals are mandating this internationally. ""No jab, no job"" may run counter to GDPR rules, or even constitutional rights, but the debate here will grow and will, I believe, be led by employees rather than managers. Everyone will want to work in a safe environment. Perhaps it will be solved, to some extent, by most office workplaces not returning until most staff are vaccinated. But the Taoiseach's intervention this week that you won't need a vaccination to return to work may not be the end of this.  Masks and distance Other controls  such as masks and some form of distancing will surely remain for quite some time. A new drive is needed on workplace ventilation - another agenda employees will push. Meanwhile, the future of travel - particularly long-haul - and what controls stay in place remain uncertain, despite the bullish talk from airlines.  The third row will be about money. A bounce in the economy will boost the public finances. The target of a deficit of just over EUR 20 billion this year will probably be undershot. This will suggest there is money to spend - even more than the significant increases already indicated. And there will be pressure to support sectors such as hospitality, the arts, aviation and travel.  But there are some storm clouds on the horizon - significant spending pressures, uncertainty about corporation tax revenue and the longer-term cost of ageing and the green agenda. A lot of the budgetary room for manoeuvre is already used up - borrowing more means betting on interest rates staying very low. And if the economy is already firing, the Government needs to be careful not to overheat the healthier sectors, while still supporting those worst hit. The likelihood of an economic bounce and the recovery of many jobs will provide a much better backdrop.  The challenge then becomes opening sustainably and shaping what happens next to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.",1,disaster,,,,,ireland
822,Irish Independent,28/10/2015,Kelly lashes out at 'cowards' as experts hit rent controls elly lashes out at 'cowards' xperts hit rent controls,"AN EXPERT economic report for part of embattled Environment Minister Alan Kelly's own department warned the justification for a rent freeze is ""relatively weak"". Two separate analyses for the Government say bringing in rent controls will actually damage the market for tenants. The uncertainty caused by the Coalition's bungling of rent policy is being blamed for driving up rents and limiting investment in property. But the under-fire minister yesterday hit out at ""cowardly"" elements in Fine Gael who he says are briefing against him. Mr Kelly also denied that he rejected a Budget deal which would have benefited lower-income families as he dug in demanding a rent freeze. And it was claimed a meeting where the plan was to be discussed was cancelled by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the day before the Budget, thereby stalling any progress. Government sources have disputed this version of events, saying a ""suite of measures could have been announced on Budget Day"" and that the meeting with Mr Kenny would only have been significant if a deal was already ""sorted out"" - which it wasn't. Mr Kelly is understood to have believed that by agreeing to the pre-Budget compromise he would have weakened his hand when trying to negotiate for rent certainty afterwards. The Labour Party deputy leader is now being nicknamed 'Calamity Kelly'. But he said he takes ""no notice of anonymous commentary"" after senior Government figures criticised his handling of the housing crisis. The Irish Independent has now learned that analysis for two agencies attached to the Department of the Environment and Department of Finance's own in-house experts warned of the consequences of bringing in the rent controls. A report by DKM Economic Consultants looked at the possible introduction of a range of regulatory options, including full rent control, links to inflation and rent caps. The report concluded the regulation ""could potentially reduce the supply and quality of rented accommodation and thus distort the market further, in the absence of any incentives to stimulate supply"". The Rent Stability in the Private Rented Sector report was prepared a year ago for the Housing Agency on behalf of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. It says the ""theoretical justification for rent regulation is relatively weak and is attributed to the unintended consequences which arise for tenants"". Potential negative impacts listed include ""black market transactions, lower quality housing, reduced mobility and more importantly a negative impact on new and existing supply"". Economists in the Department of Finance also conducted ""detailed research"" for Minister Michael Noonan when the rent control proposal was tabled. ""There are no examples of rent controls delivering a positive outcome. It does have a very negative impact on investment and supply though,"" a Government source said. Sources close to Mr Kelly noted that two other reports, one by the National Economic Social Council and one by the OECD, recently backed regulation. They also argued that the DKM report considered longterm regulation as a negative but was more open to shortterm measures. ""The main point is that investors worry far more about volatility than regulation,"" the source said. Speaking in Athy yesterday, Mr Kelly said: ""Alan Kelly on his own cannot solve this issue. It's very simple - I cannot solve this issue without co-operation across a whole range of other departments.""",1,regulation,covid,,,,ireland
598,The Irish Times,19/06/2020,Five economic issues facing new government requiring heavy lifting; Level of uncertainty new government faces in the economic arena is unprecedented,"Negotiating a programme for government in the midst of a global pandemic was never going to be easy. The document that emerged contains important policy directions and some firm commitments - but also many aspirations without much detail or costings.  So what will this mean for the economy and for businesses?  Here are the five key pointers to take about what the programme means for the next government and the crunch decisions it will take.  1  Budget 2021 With three parties involved in negotiations, the document contains a range of economic commitments coming for each of them.  The Green Party got obvious wins in areas like retrofitting and renewable energy, as well as investment in cycling and walking and the overarching carbon reduction target. Fine Gael is trumpeting the commitments to reduce borrowing and to index tax credits and bands after 2022. Fianna Fáil points to elements of its housing policy and supports for SMEs including a commitment to review the capital gains tax, as well as housing policies. However, while the programme contains a raft of commitments and promises, it does not timetable or cost most of them, and in the majority of cases does not set a clear numerical target. This may not cause an immediate problem. The first job of the new government, if it takes office, will be to agree and implement the promised July stimulus, likely to include the passage of legislation to enact the promised credit guarantee scheme - the terms of which are likely to be made more generous - and to allow ongoing delays in tax payments for business. Some investment programmes may also be flagged at this stage. But come September, work will start on Budget 2021 and the three parties will have to finalise the National Economic Plan, which will be the blueprint for what they plan to do during their term and how they would pay for it.  This is when the targets must be set and budgets agreed. The initial spend heading into next year will be funded by borrowing - the question will be how much to borrow and where to spend the money. And remember that as well as business and ongoing income supports, there will be demands from a whole range of State agencies and bodies. If the stimulus strategy works, then higher growth will help to cut the deficit in 2021 and into 2022. But at some stage, possibly in 2022, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC), the budget watchdog, has said that extra taxes or spending reductions will likely be needed to reduce the deficit and the debt burden. The National Economic Plan will not outline all of these, but it will set the scene by developing targets for the public finances. And these could lead to significant tensions. Beyond that, further resources will need to be found to pay for additional new commitments in the programme - particularly plans to increase current spending in areas like health, education and childcare. As Prof Alan Barrett of the ESRI told the Covid-19 committee this week, long-term moves towards a bigger role for the State must be paid for. There could be scope in the capital budget to delay some items to meet new investment priorities in areas like public transport,renewable energy and retrofitting. A review of the existing capital programme will scope this out and could lead to tensions, notably in relation to roads.  Some items could be hugely costly - for example electrifying more train lines, retrofitting homes, or promoting the use of electric cars ahead of the commitment not to licence any more petrol or diesel cars after 2030. An official study has estimated that current incentives cost around EUR 1.25 billion for every 100,000 cars. And there are over two million private cars on Irish roads. In terms of day-to-day items, a lot of expensive plans are outlined. After 2002 the indexing of the income tax system and - if it is decided to do it - delaying the increase in pension age could cost a combined EUR 1 billion a year. IFAC representatives at the Covid committee referred to estimates showing that current spending on introducing Sláintecare could require annual spending increases of around EUR 400 million each year over six years, as well as once-off costs of EUR 3 billion spread over the same period. Some of this may be kicked into the long grass, however, as the programme says the full cost and funding of Sláintecare may not be assessed until 2022. But it can't be ignored in the national economic plan completely. There is no doubt that the new government, if it takes office, faces its first big crunch in the autumn as the aspirations of the programme for government are turned into the reality of a costed plan. 2  Covid-19 fall-out  Much will be framed by the path of the epidemic. However, it is clear that whatever this is, the next government takes office as the full impact of a massive economic crisis hits. To an extent the economy has been on hold, with incomes supported, loans deferred and the feeling of a temporary hiatus in activity. By autumn it will be clear that many businesses cannot reopen, others will be barely ticking over and the unemployment rate, while down from current highs, will still be well into double figures, possibly at about 14-15 per cent.  The next government faces the job of winding down or amending the existing supports and trying to help businesses get through. The demands for cash will be endless and there are commitments for a range of sectoral forums from where these will emerge.  The programme says an urgent economic review will be undertaken under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, which will identify sectors that can prosper, given public health advice and economic trends. In turn these are the ones to get priority from a new national recovery fund, a key part of the new national plan. The unspoken question here is what happens to sectors which have a less certain outlook, or face ongoing problems from Covid-19 which will stunt their growth? Are they supported in the hope that the epidemic will eventually pass completely? These have the potential to be hugely contentious and difficult calls, quite possibly made against the backdrop of ongoing uncertainty.  3  Carbon challenge For the Green Party, the 7 per cent per annum carbon reduction target is central - and the pandemic may mean a significant reduction in year one, even though experts disagree on the likely scale of this.  The issue beyond this year, assuming growth has resumed, is that achieving quick progress on cutting emissions will be difficult.  This is because many of the vital investments will take time to bear fruit - the new Metro, for example, or offshore wind energy infrastructure will not reduce emissions until well into the future. The key documents here will be the binding carbon budgets to be agreed and published, putting flesh on the bones of the plan and outlining how the longer-term targets will be met. Delivering on this - taking action - then becomes vital. One of the big-ticket items is the promise to retrofit 500,000 homes over the next 10 years, a project which could cost some EUR 25 billion or more. While much of the bill will fall on households over time, the State will have to pay for retrofitting local authority houses and give generous grants and up-front support to households. Part of the funding from carbon taxes is to help with this and new financing mechanisms are to be examined - a State body, possibly the ESB,will be appointed to take a lead role.  Persuading householders to sign up to this is a big challenge, given the cost - at least EUR 40,000 per property on existing models, the long payback time and the inconvenience. New technology and models pioneered in the Netherlands may point a way forward here, allowing much work to take place off site, a relatively quick turnaround and even the possibility of homes producing excess energy via solar panels, which can be sold back to the grid, as well as major heating savings. There is a big potential opportunity here for businesses - though it remains to be seen how the pull on construction resources will sit alongside the plan to up the building of social houses and homes more generally. The recession may leave more scope in this regard.  4  Housing crisis The programme points towards a bigger role for the State in the housing market, notably via the commitment to increase the local authority housing stock by 50,000, and also to develop a cost-rental model and State-supported programmes to provide affordable housing.  There is even a plan to examine the idea of a State-supported mortgage for first-time buyers, as well as expanding the Help-to-Buy scheme. Here we see a mix of approaches from the three parties.  Marrying this into a co-ordinated programme will be a big challenge and the issues faced by the last government remain - notably the cost of land and of building. House price falls due to the economic crisis may be a factor here, but higher unemployment will also mean more people need assistance and more will fall into mortgage arrears. Dr Lorcan Sirr, senior property lecturer at the Technological University of Ireland, said that a big question is whether the State will plan to build the new homes itself, or purchase them from developers. Own-build via local authorities or housing agencies can deliver units at less than EUR 250,000, he said, indicating a total building cost of EUR 12.5 billion over the five years.  However, he said the likelihood remains that many of the houses will be bought from developers at higher prices or leased, pushing up the cost of delivery.  Whatever route is chosen, increasing social and affordable supply is a big issue. Dr Sirr points out that in recent years local authority housing output in Dublin has fallen, meaning more properties have had to be purchased to fill the gap. ""It is going to be a big operation to reverse that,"" he said.  With private contractors also facing uncertainty due to the crisis and financial pressure as sales levels fall, getting the housing sector moving will be a really challenging job.  5  Unknowns  Dealing with the unknowns. And then there are the uncertainties - and these go beyond the pandemic.  A big looming risk is that the UK leaves the EU trading regime without a deal at the end of the year, meaning trade will be conducted on WTO terms. If this happens then some sectors, particularly food and agriculture, will face high tariffs in selling into the UK. The beef sector would be particularly exposed.  A no-deal Brexit would be an unwelcome double whammy along with the Covid-19 hit.  Beyond that lie the familiar uncertainties on global tax reform - with talks on this issue again in trouble - and changing investment trends. All new governments face risks and have to amend their plans as events unfold, but it is fair to say that the level of uncertainty the new government faces in the economic arena is unprecedented.",1,fiscal,rent,,,,ireland
617,The Irish Times,21/04/1995,French victor faces an uncertain future,"WIDESPREAD strikes, a falling currency, rising interest rates and an open argument between the central bank governor and the front runner in the presidential race is hardly the most reassuring way to enter the final stages of an election campaign yet this has been the story of France in recent weeks. Thus as the race for the Elysee enters the final straight, most indicators are pointing to a torrid time ahead. At the same time, however, the stock market is cruising along and growth in Europe's second largest economy is forecast to surpass most of its neighbours. This paradoxical combination of apparent chaos and relative tranquillity has characterised the French economic and political set-up for years. 95042100166 The economy displays a series of significant imbalances a current-account surplus and soaring productivity and profits are counterbalanced by a worrisome budget deficit, anaemic real wage growth and persistently high unemployment. If we add to this mix an exchange rate policy which has never been fully credible, the true extent of the task facing the new incumbent at the Elysee becomes clear. Mr Jacques Chirac, the favourite in the presidential race, himself displays a number of seemingly incompatible ambiguities. On the one hand, he espouses right-wing rhetoric, warning of excessive public deficits and promising an acceleration of privatisation. On the other, he portrays himself as the champion of the ""little man"", arguing for real wage increases, implying that monetary policy may have to ease and reassuring the farmers of everlasting manna from Brussels. His own political history is equally chequered, having been both prime minister and defeated presidential candidate twice. So what type of president would this man make what type of economic structure would he preside over and finally, would he drive the process of European integration with the same dynamism as his predecessor? A Chirac presidency would put France first in all areas, whether it be international relations or domestic economic policy. Domestically, Mr Chirac is likely to deviate from the present policy of stagnant conservatism in favour of a more active policy of income tax reductions and privatisations. The tyranny of budget balancing will be replaced by a more sensible approach to budgetary adjustment, with the objective of reaching the Maastricht criteria by 1999, rather than by the untenable 1997. The reason for this lurch in policy stems from France's persistently high rate of unemployment. At present, 3.3 million or 12.3 per cent of the workforce are on the dole, which largely explains the subdued nature of personal consumption. Without buoyant consumption, it is difficult to maximise state revenues, thus causing the public deficit to be larger than it would otherwise be. Added to unemployment, moderate real wage growth tends to undermine consumer confidence, further depressing consumption. The dormant level of domestic demand chips away at the credibility of the exchange rate stance, primarily because there always exists the risk in investors minds that the French authorities could abandon the exchange rate policy in favour of lower interest rates. Therefore, boosting domestic consumption and reducing taxes on labour kills three birds with the one stone. First, unemployment would fall second the deficit could be reduced relatively painlessly and finally, over time, French interest rates would fall. So Mr Chirac's intention is to shake up the sleepy French system in an all-out effort to reduce unemployment. To this1 end, the Maastricht criteria will be put on the back burner. It is precisely this ambivalence to EMU which has sparked financial markets into selling the French currency, while Mr Chirac's commitment to growth is seen as being at odds with lower inflation and a stable currency. Therefore, in the short-run, the recently weakened franc could well remain under pressure. What does all this mean for Ireland? On the growth front, significantly increased domestic demand in our third largest export market can offer nothing but good news. In 1992, Ireland exported goods worth over $ 200 million (Pounds 121.9 million) to France and, more significantly, notched up a massive $ 144 million trade surplus. On the financial front, the news is mixed. Short-term franc volatility will create further problems within the battered EMS. This is particularly the case because, for the ""hopeful"" core countries such as Denmark, Belgium and Ireland, the franc is arguably more important than the deutschmark. If the franc is pushed out of the EMS, the game is up, there will be no EMU and we will (if we haven't already) become a true sterling satellite. The Belgians, Danes and French will float in limbo, somewhat stronger than the lira and peseta, but miles off the deutschmark's pace while we will follow the British currency to oblivion. But the franc has a long way to travel before the situation becomes critical and Mr Chirac will probably reiterate his support for EMU at every juncture. Unfortunately for Jacques, there is a bit of a ""he doth protest too much"" about his pro-European utterances. Whereas Mr Balladur would have been in for a smooth ride, the slightest chink in Mr Chirac's armoury over the coming years will cause further franc weakness and with it, jitters in the European corridors of power.

1377,The Irish Times,13/10/2018,Uncertainty of Brexit the only obstacle to an election,"Were it not for Brexit, we would be having a general election. The Taoiseach, hankering after his own mandate and encouraged by a series of buoyant opinion polls, fancies an election, say several of his confidants. But the uncertainty of Brexit stands in his way.  And by the time the forthcoming summits and ratification of a deal (assuming there is one) are out of the way, the election 2018 window will have closed. No government wants a February election (the last two resulted in carnage for the governing parties) so unless Leo Varadkar ignores the Brexit issue - leaving himself open to charges of enormous irresponsibility - there won't be an election until the late spring of next year at the earliest. But the forces and facts pushing Varadkar towards an election are still relevant, and they reveal important things about the state of our politics and of the Government at the centre of it. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe's steady budget and the relatively low-key reaction to it belied the difficulties in Government that preceded its presentation on Tuesday. The comings and goings over recent weeks between the Independent Alliance and Fine Gael were scratchy and increasingly ill-tempered. They corroded the sense of common purpose that must exist around any cabinet table if a government is to function effectively. Rows around that table are more frequent now and there is huge frustration among Fine Gael Ministers about what they say was the amateurish approach of the Independents to the budget process.  Example: one morning a senior Government figure listened to an Independent Minister on radio pressing the case for one of the alliance's signature budget ideas: definitely involving grannies, he recalls. He rang the Minister soon afterwards: what was this latest idea? When had it been tabled? The Minister confessed he didn't really know anything about it. Frustrated  The briefing against the Independents by Fine Gael is vicious, and it is returned with gusto. The Independents, especially Shane Ross, see efforts to frustrate them everywhere. They're often right.  Intra-Government relations are terrible. That is not in itself enough to derail a government - but combined with the present lack of a common purpose, it turns the administration into a zombie government: neither dead nor alive; existing, but not doing anything.  This is the private opinion of a number of senior Ministers and officials, including permanent civil servants. Their sanguine view is that they are stuck with it until Brexit is done; but after that there is no reason for the Government to continue. Insiders cite the tightening fiscal environment anticipated next year which will restrict the Government's ability to solve problems by throwing money at them. The more far-sighted see several such problems in the mid-distance.  The national broadband programme is a car crash, its costs ballooning, its integrity now under open question. This problem will endure after Denis Naughten's careless dining habits are forgotten. Senior Government figures wonder whether the programme is salvageable. But the political backlash in rural Ireland if it does not go ahead will be gargantuan. Cost overruns in the health sector are now of a magnitude that threatens the stability of the public finances, senior officials fear. Another effort is under way to control spending, with a new body to be granted stronger oversight powers. Perhaps it will succeed where all others have failed. If it does not, the Government will have two options: cut health services mid-year (politically impossible) or increase income taxes in next year's budget to pay for it (also impossible).  The pressures on public-sector pay are growing, and with recent deals announced for some nurses, healthcare assistants, workers in publicly funded charitable (Section 39) organisations and post-2013 recruits to the public sector, it's no wonder public sector unions reckon the Government is open for the sort of business they like to do. Siptu health workers said last week they wanted to reopen the public-sector pay agreement, which is supposed to run until the end of 2020. Independent Minister of State Finian McGrath signalled his support. The residential property tax is due to be increased next year. A carbon tax is due. Throw in your usual housing difficulties.  None of these issues present insurmountable difficulties. But very few people in the current administration believe it has the will and capacity to take difficult decisions and implement them. And because of that, they are making the case to the Taoiseach for an election. And sometimes he is making it to them.  Once Brexit is settled, it's my sense that the case for election at the decision-making level in Fine Gael will be overwhelming. The party fancies itself to be in a good position to fight that election, whenever it comes, rooted in the rise in the country's economic fortunes under its watch.  It should be cautious. Fine Gael's record will be contested (in a campaign landscape that affords the Opposition a much greater share of the debate) but in any case, it will not be decisive. Elections are not about the past. Even Bertie Ahern, running generally popular governments astride a booming economy, made his re-election campaigns about the future - remember the Fianna Fáil election slogans ""A lot done, more to do"" (2002); remember ""Now, the next steps"" (2007)? Varadkar's success will depend on his ability to convince people he can deliver a better future. Governments are never re- elected on the basis of achievements, but on what voters believe they will deliver.  With the Government stuck in ill-tempered stasis, creating that narrative for Fine Gael remains very much a work in progress.",1,political,france elections,,,,uk
1060,Irish Independent,19/05/2007,Potential leaders of our brave new world,"According to the polls, a Cocktail Cabinet of Fine Gael, Labour and the Greens could soon be running the country. MICHAEL SWIFT looks at the likely ingredients  How to make a political cocktail: pour a drop of blue, flavour with red and add a dash of green. Et voila: a fizzy little concoction that could leave you stirred, shaken and weak at the knees.  It was pretty unthinkable not so long ago, but the polls are telling us Ireland could soon be ruled by the Cocktail Coalition.  If all goes to plan, Fine Gael, Labour and Green Party politicians will be sitting around the cabinet table in the 30th Dail.  In the minds of their critics, they will be a melange of the unsuccessful and the untried. To their supporters, they will bring enthusiasm and a fresh approach.  Who, then, are the men and women to lead us into an increasingly uncertain world? To paraphrase the Lotto, it could be these:   Taoiseach: Enda KennyWhen Enda Kenny was elected leader of Fine Gael, some observers assumed he was a new TD who had somehow overcome FG's 2002 electoral nightmare. They couldn't have been more wrong.  When Enda returns to the Dail next month he will do so as its longest serving TD.  Some others could not recall the extent of Enda's ministerial experience in the last Rainbow Coalition. He was Tourism Minister. When asked of his achievements, he noted proudly that he had improved the St Patrick's Day parade.   Tanaiste and Finance Minister: Pat RabbittePat Rabbitte has something in common with Enda Kenny. Both of them hail from Mayo, though Mr Rabbitte rarely stresses this point when he tours the estates of Dublin South-West.  This time around, he has called for tax cuts, having traditionally adhered to the notion they were for ""the rich"". He is a noted wit and the politician who most annoys the outgoing Taoiseach.   Education Minister: Richard BrutonOne of the lightest TDs in the Dail, Richie nevertheless is one of its heavyweight intellects. He has attended no less than four colleges and earned a BA, MA, and MPhil in Economics.  He will probably take the education portfolio despite having spent the past five years trashing the Government on its economic record.   Environment Minister: Trevor SargentTrevor has been the member of an extraordinary number of organisations, including the Fingal Council Against Bloodsports, the Alternative Technology Association and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy. He once clambered over the Berlin Wall, but only after it had come down. He will insist pedestrians have to wait no more than 30 seconds at traffic lights.   Foreign Affairs Minister: Ruairi QuinnRuairi could be talking Greek as Foreign Minister. We mean that literally, as he was educated in the Athens Centre of Ekistics. A former Finance Minister, he is also the author of an autobiography. He has been married three times, though only to two women - one marriage was not recognised by the State.   Health Minister: Liz McManusLabour have said they want Health and Finance, and what they want they will get. A former member of the Workers' Party, Liz has published a novel, drawing her inspiration from the Bray seafront house James Joyce once wrote about.  She is known to her rivals as Lady Wicklow, due to her somewhat haughty demeanour.   Communications: John GormleyThe Green Party's John Gormley is a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, and while resident in the Mansion House he demanded a car that ran on biofuels.  It was infamous for petering out every time it stopped at traffic lights, however.  He is an avid cyclist and supported the Greens' plan to leave bicycles around the city to be picked up and parked at random.  Sadly, most ended up in the Dodder.   Transport Minister: Brendan HowlinThough a long-standing critic of Pat Rabbitte's Fine Gael pact, Mr Howlin is a shoo-in for this portfolio. And he's every bit as well groomed as the incumbent, Martin Cullen.

704,The Irish Times,12/12/2018,Hard Brexit could 'halve' Irish growth; ESRI warns about short-term impacton Ireland of UK crashing out of EU," A no-deal Brexit could almost halve Irish economic growth next year, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has warned. In its latest economic commentary, the think tank modelled the short-term impact of various Brexit scenarios on the Irish economy. It found that if the UK left the EU without a deal, and assuming World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules then apply, this would curtail growth here to 2.6 per cent compared to 4.2 per cent in the absence of Brexit. The ESRI warned, however, that the forecast probably understated the full impact of a no-deal Brexit on the Irish economy as it assumed a smooth adjustment which was ""probably unrealistic"". ""A variety of short-run effects such as heightened consumer and producer uncertainty, disruptions in financial markets and lack of access to international supply chains are not controlled for,"" it said. ""These could be quite significant in magnitude resulting in a more substantial impact on the short-term outlook than suggested here,"" the institute said. This is the first time the short-term impact of Brexit on the Irish economy has been examined.  Financial crisis The analysis comes on the back of a stark warning from the Bank of England that a no-deal scenario could have worse consequences for the UK economy than the 2008 financial crisis, with output falling by 8 per cent, the pound tumbling by up to 25 per cent and house prices falling by 30 per cent.  The ESRI's analysis suggests headline growth here would be reduced by 1 percentage point to 3.2 per cent next year even if the UK opted to join the European Economic Area (EEA), which would give it full access to the single market. However, as EEA membership is only open to EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members, the UK would have to apply for EFTA membership after it leaves the EU, which could up to take 12 months. The ESRI therefore concluded that the EEA option was unlikely to impact on either Irish or UK growth in 2019. In its report, the ESRI upgraded its growth forecasts for the Irish economy to 8.2 per cent for this year and 4.2 per cent for 2019, noting the Irish economy looked set to register another exceptional performance in 2018 with employment growing at 3 per cent and taxation receipts across most headings experiencing better-than-expected returns.   Recent budget  However, it criticised the Government's recent budget as too expansionary given the current strength of the economy but refrained from calling it ""imprudent"" as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council did last month.  The EUR 4.5 billion spending increase earmarked in Budget 2019 would have inevitable implications for the public finances with a deficit now likely in 2019. However, it noted that much of increased expenditure was being channelled into badly needed capital projects as opposed to tax cuts, a feature of the giveaway budgets in the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2008. The institute also reiterated previous warnings that the exchequer's growing reliance on corporate tax receipts posed a significant risk. ""It is imperative that policymakers do not base expenditure on potentially volatile revenues going forward,"" it said.",1,trade,,,,,uk
1239,The Irish Times,02/02/1999,Tanaiste's support for Coalition stays firm,"The Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last night hardened her support for the continuation of the Government, saying she had confidence in her Cabinet colleagues and wished to put the tensions of last week behind her. Interviewed in Tokyo during a 10-day industrial promotional trip to Japan, New Zealand and Australia, Ms Harney appeared relaxed about the future of the Coalition and cited the critical state of the Northern Ireland peace process as one of the most important reasons for bringing the Government back to business as usual. She told The Irish Times she did not think the latest allegations in Sunday's newspapers concerning money donated to Fianna Fail members created a new issue of confidence in the Taoiseach, Mr Ahern, and said that memory recall was a problem everyone had concerning events which happened years previously. ""It hasn't certainly arrived at a situation where I don't have confidence in any of my colleagues around the Cabinet table."" 99020200040 Ms Harney commented last week, when the Taoiseach spoke in the Dail about conflicting accounts of payments of money to Fianna Fail members, that loyalty and support between former Fianna Fail cabinet colleagues should not come before truth and honesty, and that she would walk from government if the truth was not told and it was not honest. She was known to be particularly unhappy with the failure of Mr Ahern to keep her fully informed on the Padraig Flynn affair. Asked if the Government would survive, she said: ""Well, I certainly hope that we can put all these matters behind us, but clear ly it's a matter for the tribunal to investigate these allegations that have been made and they are serious ones. But I will work hard to ensure that we can put the tensions of last week behind us. ""The Government is working well and there are good relationships within it. It is a good time for the economy. It's also a critical time in relation to the Northern Ireland peace process. With the deadline dates emerging, it is important that we put together the final pieces, that we complete the final chapter of the Good Friday agreement. ""The next few weeks are going to be crucially important in that regard, and I think that all our attention should go towards these issues and I hope that these distractions can be set aside."" The concerns the Progressive Democrats had expressed last week were in relation to how information was emerging, the Tanaiste said. Asked if Mr Ahern had clarified matters to her satisfaction in their conversation on Friday, she said he had phoned her when she was in Britain. ""We spoke on the telephone in excess of 30 minutes, maybe closer to an hour, and he clarified the situation in relation to meetings which he hadn't recalled in the Dail. ""I believe the Taoiseach handled the matter in the Dail very fully last week in relation to the issues for which he is accountable to the Dail, issues in relation to his role as Taoiseach or minister or that of his colleagues."" She described the allegations by Mr Tom Gilmartin as very serious. ""They are rightly in the domain of the tribunal,"" she said, ""and should be investigated as quickly as possible."" She did not think what Mr Ahern told her on Friday changed the substance of what he said to the Dail. ""In relation to some issues there was uncertainty, because clearly memory recall is not precise for us all, and people are trying to recall events of 10 or so years ago. He clarified the matter and obviously told me the situation as he understands it.""",0,,brexit,,,,
460,The Irish Times,06/11/2001,Economy in sharp downturn but recovery forecast in 2002More job losses as Swords phone-maker cuts its workforce by 450,"The sharp economic downturn has left the State in an effective recession, but a recovery will be under way by the end of next year, according to the latest forecast from the Economic & Social Research Institute. The analysis comes as the spate of job losses in the high-tech sector continued with the announcement yesterday that the phone and pager-maker Celestica is to cut 450 staff from its operation at Swords, Co Dublin, from December. However, in a more positive assessment of the economic outlook, the ESRI also says the economic slowdown will not last as long as it feared in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th attacks on New York and Washington, when it published its medium-term review. Mr Danny McCoy, author of the institute's latest quarterly bulletin - which is published today - warns that the slowing economy and the collapse in tax revenues mean that the Government must be cautious in next month's Budget. 01110600003 He says the economy is already in what he describes as a ""growth"" recession, where the rate of economic growth is less than that normally expected: ""The prospects for 2002 are extremely uncertain, but we are pencilling in a recovery in the US and then Ireland in the second half of the year."" He added that this recovery was more likely given that the dollar and stockmarkets did not collapse following the terrorist attacks and since central banks had cut interest rates. However, the institute had also been pencilling in a recovery in 2001, which is now out of the question. ""It is still possible that things will be far worse, and possibly worse than previous forecasts, if consumer confidence were to collapse, say, as the result of further attacks"", Mr McCoy admitted. Meanwhile, Celestica blamed its redundancy plans, revealed to staff at a meeting yesterday, on the cancellation of a major contract by Motorola. About 500 staff will remain with the company. This development followed the loss of 1,200 jobs throughout the State on Thursday and is a further setback to the north Co Dublin economy, where more than 2,000 Aer Lingus workers stand to lose their jobs. Doubts also surround jobs at FLS Aerospace, the former TEAM Aer Lingus, which said last Friday that it was cutting capacity. As the slowdown bites, the ESRI is now predicting that growth in Gross National Product (GNP) will average 4.9 per cent this year, down from 6 per cent in its last forecasts. However, this hides very large variations when the figures are examined on a quarterly basis - from 11.6 per cent at the beginning of the year to 0.5 per cent in the last three months. GNP would then decline to 2.6 per cent on average over 2002, again hiding large quarterly variations of from 1 per cent to 4 per cent. Mr McCoy is optimistic that if the recovery comes next year unemployment will only rise a little - averaging 4.2 per cent next year as against 3.8 per cent this year: ""But if there is no recovery in 2002, then all bets are off."" He insisted that there should not be a knee-jerk reaction to the slowdown or to the collapse in the Exchequer finances. The ESRI is continuing to urge a so-called neutral Budget; this would allow for some (pounds) 500 million in tax cuts to permit index-linking and (pounds) 400 million in social welfare increases to keep up with wage growth. If the Minister for Finance keeps to these targets and limits day-to-day spending increases to just over 7 per cent, it would means borrowing of (pounds) 500 million next year. However, larger-scale spending at levels even close to the more than 20 per cent of this year, or bigger tax cuts or spending increases in the Budget would raise the borrowing requirement considerably. In an article attached to the ESRI bulletin, Dr Anthony Leddin, of the University of Limerick, argues that pay is not flexible enough and that continued high demand could ensure that the recession is long-lived and difficult to get out of.",1,security,,,,,usa
1100,The Irish Times,15/09/2000,"Real McCoy plays the honest broker in Tiger economy facing transitionDanny McCoy believes the Government should invest in infrastructure and reduce taxes to attract people into the workforce, writes Ella Shanahan","If you were of the opinion that those ""pointy heads"" in economic institutions were all fusty old professor types, you should meet Mr - soon to be Dr - Danny McCoy. The youthful environmental economist, who has recently taken over as editor of the Economic and Social Research Institute's (ESRI) Quarterly Economic Commentary is ""a self-confessed TV watcher"" especially Eastenders and Coronation Street. He admits not only to reading Hello! magazine but to buying it. He's also what he describes as ""a frustrated athlete"". He has intervarsity medals for cross-country and middle-distance running, but now limits his exercise to cycling to work from his home in Rathfarnham every day. 00091500150 Married to Ailish, who used to work in the Investment Bank of Ireland, and they have two sons, Toby (two-and-a-half) and Sam, who is 10 weeks old. ""Have lecture notes will travel,"" he says by way of explaining the wide experience he has of teaching since he left UCD with a master's in economics 13 years ago. From Tuam, Co Galway, he did his primary degree in NUI Galway. Apart from lecturing part-time in environmental economics at TCD, he has lectured in DCU's Business School, University College, London - ""It's basically the top economics department in the UK"" - and he gave a course in environmental economics in Oxford. ""I believe markets work and environmental problems are market failures and the solution is to fix the markets,"" he says. ""The one thing I like about economics is that it challenges truisms. I like finding exceptions to rules. That is why, for our much-maligned profession, research is not a luxury. Navel-gazing such as 'where are we going in society?' would be pooh-poohed by some people."" Between 1996 and this year, he worked in the research department of the Central Bank. He does not think the role of national central banks has been diminished by the role of the European Central Bank. ""The role has got more important in that Maurice Doyle is one-seventeenth of the council, whereas Ireland is one-two-hundredth of the size of the euro area. So the ability to punch above your weight for a governor is there on the basis of very good economic analysis done by his team at home."" The Irish economy, he says, is a dynamic economy. There are two ways of looking at it: either as an economy spiralling out of control or one in a transition phase to a new, higher-growth path. Where before, the economy grew at 2 to 3 per cent, maybe now it will continue to grow at 4 or 5 per cent in the long term, he suggests. ""If you believe you are in this kind of transition to a higher growth path, then the Government should be facilitating that by increasing the infrastructure in order to cope with that demand. The Government should be investing in the economy, in the supply side story, increasing expenditure on infrastructure and reducing taxes to encourage more people into the workforce."" He concedes that there are very polarised views on this but says: ""We would lean towards that second interpretation, that the economy is experiencing fundamental transition. That is what makes it exciting, taking over the Quarterly Economic Commentary. There is a fundamental uncertainty about what's actually going on. ""From a personal point of view, to have uncertainty after taking over a new job, it's quite nice to be in an environment where everyone is unsure over exactly what are the processes going on as well. It makes it exciting."" On inflation, he says that, while external factors are very important, domestic considerations are becoming increasingly significant. Expectations - especially non-productivity justified wage expectations - are a factor that must be watched closely. The services component of the Consumer Price Index has been on the rise pretty relentlessly. And unanticipated inflation is the problem, he believes. He talks of stocks and flows to describe our economic activity. Wealth is a stock, he says. The flow is the rate at which we grow. ""Is it all going to end in tears?"" he asks rhetorically. ""There is certainly a downturn out there somewhere along the way. If we were going to continue growing at 10 per cent, we would be the richest country in the world. Sure, the flow is going to have to slow down. Will you start losing your wealth? Will that stock have to slow down? We are not going back to 1987 in terms of wealth, so our wealth is increasing on the back of those income flows."" Our economic growth - of almost 10 per cent - is on the back of six years of growth. But he does not belong to the biblical ""seven-years-of-plenty, seven-years-of-famine"" school. ""Psychologically, we could believe the economy was in bust if we just grow by 5 per cent . . . it's a danger."" For a small open economy, competitiveness is all important. ""If you lose competitiveness, you lose markets. Therein lies the worry on the partnership talks,"" he believes. He says that if wage growth gets seriously out of line with productivity growth, it will ultimately lead to significant competitive losses. ""If the euro were to suddenly change direction in combination with very high non-productivity justified wage growth, this would have a serious impact on living standards fairly directly."" He likes to think that the ESRI - occasionally called the ""poverty institute"" because of its concentration on social as well as economic issues - influences Government policy significantly. ""We certainly confront the Government with a view on the economy which they can ignore - sometimes do - and sometimes at their peril, I would have thought. We put the counterview; they need to have fairly sound grounds to say we are wrong. ""The institute here is a classic 1960s think-tank. Very often they think the unthinkable and hopefully, not the undoable. Some people think our notions are politically naive. We called for the postponement of the tax cuts until the end of PPF. That is seen as politically naive by some. That is our role: to call it as we see it. ""We have time to think about it. By nature they have to react quickly. Our views would be considered opinions; while easily dismissed, perhaps they shouldn't be. But we can bring it to the public's attention because we are honest brokers. ""This place is quite an academic institution - lots of pointy heads - but it's directed at both social and economic policies, so we try to look at things in the round, not just the efficiency arguments, but equity and distribution arguments. It makes us wider than just stockbrokers."" In spite of predictions of a slowdown in economic activity, is Mr McCoy hopeful about the future of the Irish economy? ""Very. I would be more pleased and more sanguine about this economy if our attitudes to migration and emigration were to be symmetrical. ""There are obvious concerns about our attitudes in coping with diversity at the moment. I would be very confident for the future. I think these are teething problems and transitional and new. ""I think that we can sustain jobs not just for Irish people but for other people because we are a dynamic economy which has been caught short. It doesn't have the capacity to supply the demand it's facing.""",0,,9/11 attacks,,,,
977,Irish Independent,15/01/2009,Nothing is certain but uncertainty,"TOWARDS the end of last year, I stated a belief that the Irish residential housing market was moving into a period of orderly correction or, in other words, a so-called 'soft landing', against a background of gradually rising interest rates.  But I was wrong.  The orderly correction has turned into a dramatic and very painful collapse that will eventually rank alongside some of the major housing collapses seen in the world economy over the past century.  The fact is that any hope for an orderly price correction was blown out of the water by the implosion of the US financial system and its impact on global credit conditions and the global economy.  Anything that could go wrong for the Irish housing market has gone wrong over the past year. This makes it hard for me to believe the market will bottom out this year as the Taoiseach suggested in Japan yesterday.  It's very difficult to get a handle on where house prices actually stand at the moment.  To price any asset accurately, the asset needs to be changing hands. The reality is that very few houses are being transacted so it is difficult to get a comprehensive and true picture.  The latest ESRI house price index shows that average prices nationally fell by 9.6pc in the 12 months to November. Over the past couple of days, figures from Daft.ie suggest that asking prices for Irish property fell on average by 15pc in 2008, while the IAVI's annual survey paints a similar picture.  Problem  The problem with these surveys is that they refer either to asking prices or actual prices achieved for the very few properties that are managing to sell. In either case, we are not getting a comprehensive picture of the housing market.  By my estimation, the value of the housing stock has declined by around 35pc since the peak in 2006.  Looking ahead to the coming year it is very difficult to be confident that the market will actually bottom out and start to recover. The economic and housing market fundamentals, as we understand them at the moment, are not good.  The global economy is in deep trouble and is getting worse by the day. Domestically, the economy is now in a total mess and, unfortunately, the mess is likely to get considerably worse over the coming months.  Although interest rates are falling very sharply, there are many more negatives and uncertainties that will swamp this positive interest rate effect.  The public finances are in crisis and the attempted solution will likely entail a combination of tax increases, spending cutbacks and public sector pay reduction. For those in the private sector, wages are now falling and jobs are being lost.  The bottom line for a prospective house purchaser is that it doesn't really matter where prices and interest rates are, if one is feeling very uncertain about future job security and earnings, then one will not take on a mortgage. The painful reality is that job and earnings uncertainty is now rampant.  It is not hard to see where the Taoiseach is coming from.   Confidence across the economy has been shattered and he obviously believes that we need to start talking things up.  The reality is that given the current economic environment, the very low levels of confidence look justified. Of course, the other reality is that existing house prices are still too high and can fall significantly further.  It is time for all of us to wake up and live in the real world.

797,The Irish Times,06/12/2017,"Irish-linked minister tipped to become Polish PM in government reshuffle; Morawiecki, a one-time honorary Irish consul, may succeed Szydlo","Polish-Irish relations are poised to take an interesting turn amid speculation that Mateusz Morawiecki, economics and finance minister - and a one-time honorary Irish consul in Poznan - is on course to be the next prime minister in Warsaw. Such a promotion for Morawiecki, once chief executive of AIB's Polish subsidiary, is part of a wider cabinet reshuffle reportedly planned by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. After weeks of speculation, Polish prime minister Beata Szydlo stoked up rumours she was sitting on packed boxes after a party meeting on Monday night. In a late-night tweet on Monday, viewed as a valedictory message, she wrote: ""Above all, Poland is the most important, [a country which] takes care of family and values and is secure. Which grows from a basis of Christian values, tolerant and open. Modern and ambitious. That is my country."" Szydlo led the national conservative PiS back into power two years ago with an absolute majority government and has overseen judicial reforms that have sparked an ongoing legal battle with the European Commission and widespread concern around the EU. Following Szydlo's tweet, Warsaw's rumour mill upped a gear when Morawiecki cancelled a trip to Brussels yesterday morning for urgent talks in the Polish capital. According to the Rzeczpospolita daily, the Warsaw reshuffle is likely as early as next week, with Morawiecki the most likely candidate for prime minister. Safe pair of hands Since leaving business to enter politics in 2015, the 49 year-old has earned a reputation as a competent and safe pair of hands. After four months as an Independent government minister he became a member of PiS and is now considered a Kaczynski confidante. He is already the most influential government minister, overseeing the budget, public spending, EU funds and overall economic policy.  He put his stamp on - and name to - an economic plan aimed at stimulating economic growth to pay for a new monthly allowance of 500zl (EUR 119) per child for families. A Catholic from a staunchly anti-communist family, Morawiecki is the son of Kornel Morawiecki, a founder of ""Fighting Solidarity"", a radical splinter of the union movement that brought down communism. Married with four children, Mateusz Morawiecki was involved in Poland's EU accession negotiations, held several academic teaching and research posts and, in July, was the first Polish finance minister to attend a G20 meeting. A decade ago, when Poland was gripped by economic upheavals under another PiS government, he told The Irish Times that the Polish economy was ""clearly quite immune to politics"". ""It's a sign of maturity of the Polish economy,"" said Morawiecki, then chief executive of Bank Zachodni WBK, which was sold by AIB in 2010. A decade on, his wisdom appears to hold: despite uncertainty in a rule-of-law row with Brussels, the Polish economy is firing on all cylinders with forecasts of more than 4 per cent growth this year, the highest in six years. Nor has the political turbulence hit the ruling party's popularity: it currently stands at 45 per cent in opinion polls, up almost 10 points from its 2015 election result. Delicate juncture But the likely reshuffle - and  Morawieck's possible promotion - comes at a delicate juncture in Polish politics. The government's controversial judicial reforms are likely to enter its final act this week, and the national conservative ruling party is renewing efforts to tighten up abortion regulations. Meanwhile, Morawiecki's Irish links and rumoured appointment as prime minister could soon put him in a delicate position, given Poland will side against Ireland in its EU court appeal against a European Commission ruling that Apple owes the Dublin government EUR 13 billion in back taxes. Regardless of how the reshuffle plays out, all PiS politicians in Poland know the golden rule of the top government job: a PiS prime minister's power is borrowed. The last word rests with PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski who, despite energetic denials by his ministers, pulls the governmental strings from the background. And not everyone is convinced that the ex-Irish consul is a shoo-in for the top job in Warsaw. Some point to a decade-old precedent, when Kaczynski ousted the then PiS prime minister to take the top job himself.",0,,housing crisis,,,,
1309,The Irish Times,20/03/2020,The need for a massive response; Global economic crisis,"The speed and extent of the shock to the world economy from the coronavirus crisis is unprecedented - and so an unprecedented policy response is required. The necessary restrictions on movement, interaction, business and our daily lives is inevitably leading to an extraordinary economic hit. How long this crisis will continue, and what the world will look like when the worst passes, remain worryingly uncertain. While public health is the clear priority, never have the challenges for economic policymakers been more pressing. Governments and central banks have moved quickly, promising vast sums in extra spending and additional liquidity. Some lessons appear to have been learned from the last financial crisis, when the policy response was too slow and too timid. Yet more may be needed. Saving as many businesses as possible and supporting their staff is vital work. Replacing collapsing private sector demand with public cash is also important.  The ECB, one of the organisations most open to criticism for its response to the financial crisis, has moved more quickly this time. Its promise to purchase up to EUR 750 billion of bonds this year, announced late on Wednesday after an emergency teleconference of its governing council, may calm bond markets for the moment. Yet solidarity in the euro zone is still likely to be tested, with the Italian economy facing massive costs. Much work was done to strengthen the euro zone after the crisis, but weak spots and unfinished business remain - and leaders and the ECB may face further tests in the months ahead. The ECB's move is also important for Ireland. The cost of the response is rising sharply and it is important that Ireland retains access to the markets at low borrowing costs to fund this. The public finances will inevitably move substantially into deficit this year. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has already announced significantly increased spending to fund the health service and try to protect businesses and their employees hit by the crisis. Difficult decisions lie ahead on how to pay for all this - and what it means for spending and tax in the long term . For now, however, the focus must remain on funding the health service and dealing with the economic fall-out. Economic policymakers - as well as those managing businesses - are now flying blind, to the extent that the duration of the current restrictions, and possibly additional ones, remain unclear. The Government's first job is to protect its citizens as much as it can. Doing so, via widespread restrictions, carries an economic cost in the short term. That is inevitable. The sooner the crisis passes, of course, the sooner the economy can start to recover. Minimising the damage caused in the meantime and stopping the economic crisis spreading further than is necessary is important and difficult work. ",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
1044,The Irish Times,05/01/2016,Policymaking in the face of uncertainty,"The economic crisis, from which we are now recovering, taught us many lessons. Some of them will be remembered for some time to come.  One of the most obvious is the need for caution in policymaking to take into account the fact that the future will certainly be different from what we expect. Too often policies are formed on the assumption that tomorrow will be very like today, and that surprises, pleasant or unpleasant, never happen. One way to approach this problem of uncertainty is to consider a range of ""what ifs"": how would policy be affected if things turn out worse than expected and also how robust is policy to higher growth than expected?  Such an approach requires a move away from reliance on a single, often optimistic, forecast instead testing out a range of possibilities. Over 25 years publishing medium-term projections for the Irish economy at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), one of the most difficult issues we faced was how best to present the uncertainty that necessarily surrounded such an exercise.  In every case a range of scenarios was published rather than a single set of numbers. However, in each case there was substantial pressure, especially from the press, to identify a single ""most realistic"" scenario because of the difficulty of presenting a very complex picture to a wider audience.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) in its reports has included a useful tool which illustrates the uncertainty that surrounds short-term forecasts using an illustrative ""fan"" chart showing a range of possible outcomes with varying degrees of likelihood. As a result of taking the uncertainty about the future into account, the IFAC's recommendations on fiscal policy have consistently been more cautious than those of the Government. Alternative scenarios  For many years now, as part of the budgetary process, the budget documents present some limited alternative scenarios on what might happen if world growth were lower than assumed or if euro area interest rates were higher than expected.  However, these scenarios receive very little attention, possibly because the circumstances under which these outcomes might arise is not discussed in any detail. Nonetheless, it is important to consider their implications.  Over the rest of this decade there are a number of obvious risks to the relatively benign forecasts available from different sources.  The sensitivity analysis in the budget, which considers the possible effects of a one percentage point rise in interest rates on the Irish economy, is particularly important. It suggests that such an increase in interest rates would have a major impact on the Irish economy: it could reduce the level of GDP by 2 per cent and increase the government deficit by over 1 per cent of GDP. Thus the impact on the economy could be quite severe, not just because of Irish indebtedness but also because a rate rise would negatively impact on growth in the euro zone. While it seems clear that European Central Bank interest rates will remain low for at least the next two years, if the euro zone area economy recovers and when the effect of the fall in oil prices on inflation wanes, a significant rise in interest rates would be on the cards.  Even after the surge of debt repayment that is going on in Ireland today, the State will remain quite indebted in 2018. This risk to future economic prospects from an interest rate rise in 2018 or 2019 argues for caution today. One implication is that the government should reduce future risk from a rise in interest rates by gradually reducing the debt burden.  Rise in rates  A related approach, adopted by the National Treasury Management Agency, is to borrow now for longer periods of 10 or more years so that debt interest payments will be less impacted by a rise in rates later this decade. Similarly, companies and households can fix their interest rate for a number of years at a price. Such a strategy can make sense.  One effect of the financial crisis over the period 2009-14 was that, when considering uncertainty about forecasts, all of the attention focused on what might go wrong. Because of the massive problems which the economy faced, it was eminently sensible to consider downside risk and to try and prevent it or to prepare contingency plans to deal with it.  However, over the course of the crisis such a fixation on disaster scenarios also blocked out the need to consider the implications of a vigorous economic recovery. Even as the economy began to recover in 2013, it took some time to convince policymakers and the public the worst was truly over.  Some of the obstacles to a recovery in building, especially in housing, could have been addressed in 2012 or 2013. However, the prevailing pessimism meant there was no focus on the possible needs that might arise from a successful recovery.  As a result of inaction in 2012 and 2013, a significant risk to future economic and social development in Ireland arises from a shortage of key infrastructure today - in particular housing.  The rapid rise in rents and the rise in house prices has reflected the growing pressures as housing supply has been very slow to recover. This increase in rents is giving rise to serious social costs and it will also adversely affect competitiveness if not rapidly addressed.  This highlights the need to consider upside as well as downside scenarios for the economy in formulating policy.",0,,covid,,,,

The Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, has expressed confidence that the referendum will be carried by at least a 60:40 margin - in line with the results of yesterday's Irish Times/MRBI opinion poll. But, as some of his backbenchers remained unconvinced of the outcome, Mr Reynolds made a last- minute appeal to the electorate to deliver a decisive victory to the Government in the interests of the economy and the country. The confidence of the Taoiseach over the outcome was reflected in the off-the-record acceptance by some people involved in the ""No"" campaign that the treaty was likely to be endorsed. But a spokesman for the Pro-Life Campaign said that the coincidence of polling day with the Church holy day of Corpus Christi could have a significant influence on the size of the ""No"" vote. The German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, spoke yesterday of the need for the Maastricht Treaty to be adopted and he warned that European integration would otherwise be set back for 25 years. Right across Europe, concern is growing in intensity, and not just at government level. Bond interest rates and currency markets across the EC will be influenced by the outcome and, yesterday in Dublin, the market in Government bonds gained ground when the positive findings of The Irish Times opinion poll became known. The leader of Fine Gael Mr John Bruton, appealed for a ""'Yes"" vote on the grounds that the treaty was ""a step along the road to a united, peaceful and prosperous Europe in which a self- assured Ireland will make its mark"". People, he said, should make up their minds on the basis of a calm assessment of their best interests and not on the basis of fear or greed. The leader of Democratic Left, Mr Proinsias De Rossa, said the outcome was still uncertain, because of the high proportion of undecided voters. He urged those people who had concerns about the right to travel, about the defence implications and about the economic implications of Maastricht to vote ""No"". The leader of the Progressive Democrats and Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr O'Malley, urged people to exercise their franchise, either for or against, because of the importance of the democratic process. His party believed that the destiny, welfare and prosperity of Ireland could best be served within Europe, he said, and continued: ""Ireland has a unique opportunity to revitalise the process of deeper Community integration and to reinvigorate the European Union. in the wake of its rebuff at the hands of the Danish electorate."" Preparations were being made last night by anti-abortion groups to deliver thousands of early- morning leaflets to homes throughout the country. Printed with the assistance of English-based anti-abortion groups, the leaflet states: ""Since you went to bed last night five Irish babies have been killed by abortion in Britain."" It says: ""Protect Ireland's Unborn. Put Life Before Money"", and quotes ""What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul"" before urging a ""No"" vote. The Catholic Bishops' Conference statement on the Maastricht Treaty, of which some 500,000 copies have been issued, was a full, comprehensive and final statement, according to its official spokesman, Bishop Joseph Duffy of Clogher. Speaking at the end of the conference's summer meeting, he added: ""We spelled out the implications of a ""Yes' vote and of a 'No' vote, and we stated quite categorically that we were not imposing any duty on anybody to vote one way or the other.""",0,,,,,,
406,The Irish Times,26/04/2001,Dublin And Brussels,"There is a long road to travel in developing an efficient way of co-ordinating economic policy across the euro zone. That much is clear from the continued tensions between the EU Commission and the Government on economic policy here. Again, yesterday, the Commission called for the Government to take ""countervailing budgetary measures"" this year to slow growth and warned that spending must be more tightly controlled in future. Both of these recommendations will displease the Minister for Finance, Mr McCreevy, who has already publicly resisted EU advice on budgetary matters. 01042600120 The underlying issue is who controls budgetary policy in a monetary union. Most euro-zone member governments want to retain full control of their own tax and spending policies, but in turn would not be slow to criticise any other state which is seen to step out of line. In turn, the European Commission - and the European Central Bank - are trying to develop central monitoring of national budgets, which they believe is essential for the euro area to operate efficiently. Ireland has become the first major test case in this important policy area. In February, tensions broke out in public, following criticism by the Commission - subsequently approved by the other finance ministers - of the 2001 Budget package. The Commission has repeated these criticisms in its latest document and also called for the Government ""to prepare a budget for 2002 that contributes to an orderly easing of demand."" The Government has indicated that it will seek to change these guidelines before they are formally approved. It is quite within its rights to do so and there are some aspects of the guidelines which are unclear and, in some cases, seem contradictory. For example, it is not clear whether the Commission is seeking the slowdown of capital spending under the National Development Plan. And it remains uncertain what kind of ""countervailing budgetary measures"" the Commission would wish to see this year. It is essential that the dialogue on these issues between the Government, the Commission and the other member-states, is conducted in a measured and useful way. The Commission was unnecessarily heavy-handed in its initial statements on the issue; the Government here, in turn, did not handle the issue well and allowed a very public row to develop. Both sides need to engage more constructively now - the imminence of the Nice Treaty vote makes this more likely to happen. The Commission's latest recommendations do raise some tricky issues for the Government. The EU officials have called for restraint on Government spending, which has been more or less abandoned in recent years. If Mr McCreevy ignores this, he risks a further reprimand. If he accepts the advice from Brussels, he will be unable to bring in the kind of pre-election spending increases which the Government would like. The appropriate stance for next year's Budget will depend very much on how the economy is performing later this year. The Commission sees risks to Ireland from the US slowdown, but is still optimistic about growth rates here. Both Mr McCreevy and the Commission will hope for a gradual easing in economic growth and a fall-off in inflationary pressures. If this happens, then agreement on the appropriate shape of the 2002 Budget between Brussels and Dublin will be easier to achieve.",1,regulation,,,,,EU
321,The Irish Times,29/04/2015,Continuing growth key to plan,"The spring statement assumes Ireland's economy will expand this year by 4 per cent and continue growing at an annual rate above or about 3 per cent until 2020. The continuation of such economic growth is the foundation stone on which the plan is built. So how realistic are the forecasts?  The key projections here are for this year and next, as the 2015 performance and the outturn anticipated for 2016 will determine the availability of funds for the October budget. This is crucial from the perspective of the Coalition, which has promised a tax cut of at least EUR 600 million ahead of the election and the same amount in a spending increase. Moreover, the next budget would be the first of another five expansionary budgets if the plan sticks.  Although the assumed rate of GDP growth in 2015 is down from 4.8 per cent in 2014, it would still be the highest in Europe. The crucial driver here is the continued increase in domestic demand as consumers spend more and businesses invest more. This is on top of continued strength in the export sector, itself a beneficiary of recovery in the American and British economies and potential beneficiary of the long-awaited recovery in the wider European economy.  The 4 per cent forecast for 2015, up from the 3.9 per cent projection on budget day last autumn is a little ahead of the expectations set out by the OECD, the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the Central Bank. Among public bodies, only the Economic and Social Research Institute is forecasting higher growth than the Government. The ESRI believes the economy will expand 4.4 per cent. Real-time flow of data  Although international bodies tend to be conservative in their assessments, the fact remains that the Government has deeper insight into the real- time flow of data on national finances and other key indicators. The hunch remains that Noonan's latest growth forecast probably understates the position. After all, pay talks loom with public sector unions and there are many other claims on the funds available to raise expenditure. A bigger uplift in the growth forecast would only encourage the political clamour for recovery dividends.  After all, business lobby Ibec has forecast 5.5 per cent growth this year. Ibec forecasts are rarely in the conservative realm. But the argument is made in Government circles that the group's projections do not take account of the fact that the expansion in Irish economic activity also increases imports into the State, thereby constraining the actual growth rate.  Still, the fact remains that tax revenue this year is set to come in EUR 1 billion ahead of budget-day expectations. While public expenditure will be some EUR 250 million higher than set out , tax buoyancy will still reduce the deficit.  Last autumn, the Government forecast a deficit this year of 2.7 per cent of GDP. While this has now been reduced to 2.3 per cent, that's not the full story. Pending a formal decision by European statisticians, the 2.3 per cent figure assumes the liabilities of Irish Water will be held on the balance sheet of the State.  The Government is campaigning for such liabilities to off balance sheet. There is no certainty as of yet on that front, and some figures in Government circles believe this is but a 50:50 prospect. If Irish Water goes off balance sheet, then the deficit forecast for 2015 would go down to 2 per cent. In line with figures set out in the statement, such a decision would bring the State a step closer to a balanced budget in 2017 and a surplus would be achieved in 2018.  Other positive trends are in train this year, not least the euro's weakness and the low oil price. Thanks to early IMF repayments on super-low borrowing cost on the open market, interest costs on the national debt will this year be lower than anticipated. The interest burden this year will fall to an estimated 10 per cent of general government revenue from 13 per cent in 2013. Moreover, the Government expects to receive a EUR 500 million increase this year in the surplus forecast from the Central Bank. A good deal of this sum cannot be included as a revenue as it is attributable to capital gains realised on the bank's early sell-off of Irish sovereign bonds it holds as a result of the deal to scrap Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  Risks  That there are risks to the outlook is not in doubt. The fate of Greece is uncertain. In addition, a bubble may be developing in international financial markets. Although the risk of deflation in the euro zone has receded, the plans says an increase of one percentage point in the ECB's main interest rate would cut the size of Ireland's GDP by an appreciable amount. That's not going to happen this year or next but Department of Finance figures say such a rise in any of the years between 2017 and 2020 would result in a once-off drop in GDP of between 2.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent.",1,fiscal,EU budget,,,,ireland
563,The Irish Times,25/06/2021,Fears of surge in house prices over the next 18 months,"A key factor in the financial crisis was the exceptionally risky behaviour of banks' lending to property developers and to households. In turn, there was an abject failure by the Central Bank to ensure that banks did not take excessive risk and also to ensure that borrowers did not bite off more than they could chew through excessive mortgages.  The splurge of lending drove house prices to unsustainable levels by 2007. The rest is history.  As the economy began to recover in 2015, the Central Bank acted to ensure that such a failure by banks or borrowers would not happen in the future.  It put in place restrictions on how much banks could lend to individual households, based on the value of the house and the mortgage holder's income.  These measures were designed to manage financial risk, not to control house prices. Before deciding on the calibration of the restrictions, the Central Bank organised extensive consultations and undertook important research.  First-time buyers The research showed that, contrary to what one might have expected, first-time buyers had been less likely to default on their mortgages than those who had traded up. Hence the regulations were tweaked to allow first-time buyers to borrow up to 80 per cent of the value of a house. Speaking last week, the governor of the Central Bank, Gabriel Makhlouf, noted that, in the absence of the mortgage measures, the house-price-to income ratio would have been between 4.9 and 5.4 as at March 2019, compared with the actual level of 4.4 times.  With almost 50 per cent of current mortgages having been issued under the new rules, the borrowers had greater buffers to deal with a temporary loss of income due to the pandemic.  As a result, the current pandemic-related downturn has been marked by relatively little mortgage distress. As explained by the Central Bank governor, the loan-to-income limits provide a buffer against the effects of income and employment shocks, which increases the resilience of borrowers and reduces the probability of default.  Loan-to-value restrictions provide an equity buffer against house price declines, and directly lower the loss in the event of a default. House prices reached a floor in 2013, the year the economy began its recovery.  In the intervening period house prices have risen by 90 per cent, with the severe shortfall in housing supply driving prices back up to 2008 levels, despite wider pandemic challenges.  However, as separate research by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Bank has shown, the cautious approach to mortgage borrowing has slowed the pace of rising house prices.  Had more money been lent to buyers, it would have pushed house prices even higher.  While developers would have benefited, the increased risk would have fallen on borrowers and banks. Six years on, the Central Bank is taking a second look at the mortgage measures to see if they should be tweaked to better manage potential risks. As economies recover from the pandemic shutdown, one uncertainty is what Irish and European households will do with the large volume of exceptional savings built up when we couldn't go out and spend.  The scale of these savings in the Republic amounts to more than twice what was spent on new houses in 2019.  While only a fraction of these savings is likely to enter the housing market in the form of higher house deposits people can now pay, this could still exert major upward pressure on prices. After the second World War, which also had led to exceptional household savings, many countries experienced a surge in house prices as some of this cash went on housing.  In the United States, although housing supply responded quite rapidly, house prices rose by 25 per cent after 1945.  In Sweden, the Republic and the UK, by 1948 real house prices had risen by more than 50 per cent.  Real concern Given the exceptionally slow response of Ireland's housing supply, there must be a real concern that house prices will surge here over the next  18 months.  Already in the Netherlands they are up by 13 per cent on a year ago, and in the US they are 24 per cent higher.  Can Ireland be far behind? While a tightening of mortgage rules could help calm house price pressures over the next 18 months, this is not the job of the Central Bank: its remit is to protect financial stability.  If the Government wants to tackle house price inflation, it needs to seriously ramp up supply and it should stop throwing petrol on the flames through schemes that put more money in the hands of buyers, only to end up in the pockets of sellers.

734,The Irish Times,05/11/2010,Ibec says EUR 6 billion figure 'about right',"BUSINESS REACTION:BUSINESS GROUPS were quick to respond yesterday to the Government s plans to frontload EUR 6 billion of its planned EUR 15 billion four-year adjustment into the budget for next year. Employers body Ibec described the plan for budgetary adjustment over the coming four years as a proportionate and credible response to the budget deficit . Ibec director general Danny McCoy said: The EUR 6 billion figure for budget 2011 is about right. It will bring the budget deficit for 2011 below the 10 per cent psychological threshold and puts the public finances on track to reach the 3 per cent deficit target by 2014.  Mr McCoy described the Government s forecasts for economic growth over the period as prudent and as leaving some room for upside, which may ease the adjustment burden as we approach 2014 . However, he warned that households will wonder what exactly the adjustment will mean for them in taxation terms and this is likely to create uncertainty between now and budget day. Chambers Ireland, which represents more than 13,000 businesses across the State, said it was imperative that the Government s economic strategy realised savings on current spending rather than on the back of capital spending which it said was vitally needed to sustain a functioning wider economy . In a statement, Chambers Ireland deputy chief executive Seán Murphy said: Despite the lack of specifics contained in the Economic and Budgetary Outlook document, we hope that we have the time to convince the bond markets post-budget 2011 that these plans are credible.  Mr Murphy continued: It is critical that the interest paid on future Government debt contracts falls, as paying interest rates of 7 per cent plus will not be financially sustainable.  Mark Fielding, chief executive of Isme, which represents 8,500 small and medium businesses, said the front-ending of measures should lead to confidence in the business sector, creating the perception that the Government is serious about tackling the issues . The challenge, he said, would be the ratio between cutbacks and tax increases. Tax increases are likely to have a negative effect on business . Speaking last night, Mr Fielding said: If there are cutbacks, we would call for these to be made in the public sector. In addition to cuts, the Government would have to include some form of stimulus package to get small to medium businesses moving again . He said such moves would not only instil business confidence at home but also confidence amongst lenders and bondholders. ",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
872,The Irish Times,23/01/1993,"Long, hard battle for the poundThis weekend it looks as if the Government has successfully fought off the currency speculators' assault on the pound. From Brussels, Sean Flynn traces the key moves in the long battle to avert devaluation","ON MONDAY morning, January 11th, just 24 hours before the new Government took office, the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, and his most senior officials completed a two-page letter to the German Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, on the currency crisis. The contents of the letter could hardly have been more direct. ,The Irish Government, it said, was deeply concerned about the -perception in the money markets that there were ""special supporting arrangements"" between Ger many and France to support the French franc which did not appear to extend to other ERM currencies like the Irish pound. The Taoiseach went on to express his disappointment with the failure of the EC authorities to respond to the deep-seated crisis in the ERM - even though the system was intended to pave the way for monetary union. The letter set out the great strides made by the Irish economy in recent years. Inflation was low, the balance of payments posit ion was good, the country was well placed to meet the Maastricht criteria for the final phases of monetary union. A unilateral devaluation of 'the Irish pound, in such circumstances, would wipe out these achievements. The in coming government and the opposition parties were determined to oppose devaluation. The speculators were bearing down on the Irish economy. Interest rates were at unsustainable levels in order to repel them. Ireland urgently needed much more active support from Bonn and from its EC partners. There was an urgent need for immediate and detailed consultations between the most senior finance officials in Dublin and in Bonn. The Chancellor, it said, should be in no doubt about what was at stake for monetary union. If the speculators were allowed to bring down the,Irish pound, they would soon hunt down other currencies. THE second strand of the Government's diplomatic offensive was directed at the EC Commission in Brussels. During last week, the EC Commission President, Mr Jacques Delors, and the EC Monetary Affairs Commissioner, Mr Henning Christophersen, were also told in very robust terms about what was at stake for the Irish economy and for the entire Community. After consultations with the Government, the Irish EC Commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn pressed home the message in personal consultations with both commissioners: the currency crisis in Ireland is a European and not an Irish problem. Ireland was weary of fighting a lone battle to defend the ERM. The Government's diplomatic initiative yielded almost immediate benefits. In Bonn, the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, told RTE that the Irish pound was in fine fettle. In Copenhagen, Mr Delors acknowledged for the first time that the problems of the ERM would have to be more seriously addressed. On Monday of this week EC finance ministers endorsed the Government's opposition to devaluation and promised that the ERM countries would fully support the currency. This declaration, coupled with hints of an early cut in German interest rates, , has , led to some cautious optimism in Government circles that the Irish pound has now weathered the storm. It all seems far away from the situation almost three weeks ago when the Minister for Finance, ,Mr Ahern, fumed with rage after he had read press agency reports from Paris and Bonn. The reports detailed a joint Franco-German declaration to support the French franc but it made no mention whatever of the Irish pound. At the time, the Government estimated that no fewer than,43 separate banks were speculating against the Irish pound and Ireland was trying desperately to hold the line against devaluation. For Ahern, the Bonn statement was further evidence that the Germans were not playing by the rules of the ERM. These require the strongest currencies to intervene actively in support of the weakest currency when it falls to the floor of the ERM. Government spokesmen now prefer not to dwell on such incidents. There is a sense that a battle has been won - even if it has been achieved at a huge cost in terms of currency reserves, interest rates and competitiveness. Reflecting on the past six months, one Government figure says: ""We are all a bit weary from battle but there have been considerable achievements. We did not follow sterling out of the ERM and we have held the line since. We have darned our brownie points with the markets"". The Government remains steady in its resolve to defend the Irish pound. In a statement to The Irish Times on Thursday, the Government said that the considered advice of the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) was that Ireland should continue its ""unbending defence"" of the pound within the ERM. While the underlying policy has not changed, it is also the case that Ireland's six-month battle to defend the pound has left some senior Government figures with a more jaundiced view of the EC's grand plan for monetary union. One senior figure confided: ""Sometimes you begin to wonder if the Community is really serious about monetary union."" THE ERM was designed to transform the EC into a zone of monetary stability. The intention was to minimise currency fluctuations and so create a more stable trading environment. Jacques Delors reflected last week that the EC has, for several years past, lived under the delusion that it had established a fixed exchange rate policy which was rock-solid. The events of Black Wednesday, September 16th last, when the ERM imploded, shattered this myth. Three main factors combined to put the ERM under severe pressure: uncertainty about the Maastricht Treaty plan for monetary union, the slow-down in economic activity and the high level of German interest rates. At a meeting of EC finance ministers in England on September 4th, the Germans held out an olive branch: Britain, Spain and Italy could all devalue in what would be interpreted as a general realignment. For various reasons, the three countries in question spurned this offer. But the markets had read the signals. These currencies were overvalued within the ERM. Inevitably, the speculators were soon on the offensive. The British pound and the Italian lira dropped out of the ERM later in September, The Spanish peseta has been twice devalued in an effort to hold down its position. Britain's decision to pull sterling out of the ERM on Black Wednesday hit the Irish Government like a cluster bomb. Ire- land's exposure to sterling (some 32 per cent of our exports go to Britain) meant that the Irish pound was suddenly very vulnerable. Mr Reynolds w as en route to San Jose on a trade mission when he heard the news about sterling. On arrival, he stayed in contact throughout the night with Mr Ahern and a group of senior officials gathered in Dublin. An emergency committee was established to manage the crisis. This included Mr Ahern; Dr Michael Somers and Mr Adrian Kearns, of the NTMA; Mr Sean Cromie n, Secretary of the Department of Finance; and Mr Maurice O'Connell, Second Secretary at Finance. Mr Reynolds also instructed senior officials to present him with a profit-and-loss style balance sheet assessing the various policy options. In late September, the narrow French vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty was creating further turbulence in the ERM. Some commentators suggested that an Irish devaluation could boost export and growth prospects. But the Government had by now decided that it would hold the line against devaluation. The majority view on the emergency committee was that it was in Ireland's long-term strategic interest to maintain the existing parities. This could help to guarantee Ireland a place in the first tier when the European Community moved to the final phase of monetary union. The Community's response to the convulsions within the ERM had been very weak. The British EC presidency convened an emergency summit to consider the crisis in Birmingham on October 16th but at the last minute it backed away from the problem. This was hardly surprising. The British 'presidency had no real moral authority to push for reform of the ERM, given that its pound was now outside the system and British intentions were unclear. Germany also had no taste for a discussion in which others' could point an accusing finger at its high-interest-rate policy. In the end, the summit kicked for touch by asking the EC Monetary Committee to examine ways of reforming the ERM. THE Monetary Committee, a group of central bankers and or finance officials, is responsible for the management of the ERM. The Irish representatives are Mr Maurice O'Connell and Mr George Reynolds, assistant general manager of the Central Bank. On occasion, Mr Michael Tutty of the Department of Finance and Mr John O'Leary of the Central Bank also represent the Government. The committee has struggled to impose itself on the ERM crisis. ""We are like fair-weather friends' who have been thrown together into desperate waters,"" said one source. There is no real co-ordination … and a mood of great The central complaint is that the Bundesbank's high-interest policy has tightened the noose on the EC economies. Concern has also been expressed that Germany is involved in special ""behind-the- scenes"" arrangements with France to defend the franc. Ireland and several other smaller countries have found it difficult to exert any influence on the committee. This has left us very much at the mercy of events. Through September and October, the Government relied on interest-rate management and special subsidies to ease the crisis. Interest rates were pushed up by three per cent in late September. A special £50 million market development fund was established to help exporters in October. In November, the decision of the Swedish authorities to let the krona float freely unleashed a fresh wave of speculative pressure. The Spanish peseta and the Portugese escudo were forced to devalue by five per cent. The Government - by now preoccupied with the election campaign - still insisted that Ireland could hold the line. On November 12th, Mr Reynolds travelled to Bonn to discuss the Edinburgh EC summit with Dr Kohl. Inevitably, the meeting was dominated by discussions on the EC budget negotiations in which Ireland was pitching for over £6 billion. It was at this meeting that Dr Kohl decided to back the demands and so pave the way for Ireland to secure up to £8 billion. The turmoil in the ERM had, of course, been discussed during the meeting. But Mr Reynolds could hardly adopt a bullish approach On the ERM while also seeking German support at Edinburgh on December 11th and 12th. In the weeks before Edinburgh, the German Secretary of State for Finance, Mr Horst Kohler, at the specific request of Mr Ahern, used very possible opportunity at EC finance ministers' meetings to express his confidence in the Irish pound. But the markets did not seem entirely convinced. At Edinburgh itself the heads of government concentrated on the budget negotiations while finance ministers discussed the overall problems of the EC economy. Mr Ahern became increasingly exasperated as he listened to a polite, academic discussion. He intervened sharply and spoke in an emotional, impatient way about Ireland's very tough battle to avoid devaluation. The ERM, he said, was supposed to be a staging post towards monetary union. As good Europeans, the Irish had made great sacrifices to meet, the Maastricht criteria for entry to the final stages of monetary union. ""But look at us now,"" he said. Interest rates were at unreal levels, exporters were under severe pressure as Ireland battled to defend the ERM. By the time the ERM faced renewed turbulence earlier this month, the long-drawn-out discussions on the formation of a government were well under way. In the Fianna Fail-Labour discussions, Mr Ahern and the Lab,our negotiator, Mr Ruairi Quinn, swiftly agreed that the currency crisis was the most pressing problem facing the new Government. But the long interregnum meant that there was little point in mounting a diplomatic offensive. The need for stronger EC solidarity became strikingly clear three weeks ago when the Central Bank had to raise its overnight lending rates - first to 50 per cent and then to 100 per cent - in an attempt to push back a renewed wave of speculative pressure against the pound. The problem began when Mr Ahern, cup of tea in hand, came into a press briefing given by his senior officials. The influential Financial Times interpreted his off the-cuff remarks as ""the strongest hint yet"" that the defence of the pound might be abandoned. Mr Ahern later claimed that his comments were misinterpreted. It was during this same week that France and Germany issued the joint statement which signalled their determination to defend the French franc, but made no mention of the pound. This statement prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity by the Government. Mr Ahern contacted Mr Koehler to express his concern. He told the French Finance Minister, Mr Michel Sapin, that if the pound was allowed to fall out of the system, this would encourage the speculators to pursue the Danish krone and eventually the French franc. The ERM crisis was a European and not an Irish problem, he repeated. The French and Germans responded that they had never intended to damage the Irish pound. The message was that no offence was intended. In response, Mr Ahern spoke publicly for the first time about a Franco-German ""sweetheart deal"" which was making it much more difficult to defend the pound. The Government did not launch a concerted offensive at EC level, however, until the new administration took office last week. The Government has been encouraged by the market response to last Monday's declaration by EC finance ministers. At one stage this week it felt it was out of the woods with healthy inflows back into, the economy and sterling continuing to strengthen. The hope is that this week's EC declaration may see much more active support for the pound - but only time will tell. The renewed weakness of sterling which has pushed it to about IR 109p against the pound has inevitably raised questions about the Government's long-term strategy. One Government figure said:""Our resolve to defend the pound is as firm as ever, although we are naturally assessing the situation on a daily basis. In this currency crisis you never know, until you get up in the morning, just what will hit you today.""",1,monetary,taxes,,,,EU
651,The Irish Times,16/12/2010,Government feels brunt of public's anger,"ANALYSIS:Relatively unscathed by Budget cuts, over-65s alone buck the anti-Government trend TODAY S IRISH Times/Ipsos MRBI poll lays bare the public anger towards how the Government is managing the country. Satisfaction with the Government s performance has slumped to 8 per cent, the lowest level recorded in more than 25 years of polling. Fieldwork for this latest poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week, one week after the Government delivered the first of at least four tough budgets, and almost one month since the IMF and the ECB arrived in Dublin to deliver a rescue package for the economy. And voters have clearly decided to shoot the Budget messenger. Support for Fianna Fáil has dived seven points to 17 per cent amongst the electorate in general, and to just 11 per cent among Dublin voters. Only 10 per cent of voters from the professional (AB) classes intend to vote for Fianna Fáil in the next election. The good news for Fianna Fáil in today s poll is probably confined to the party s near bulletproof performance among the (relatively unscathed in budget terms) over 65s, where support at 33 per cent is almost double its national average. With 2 per cent support, Fianna Fáil s partners in Government, the Green Party, are unchanged since the September poll. Their decision to pull out of Government once the Budget process has been completed does not appear to have provided any electoral bonus. Fine Gael and Sinn Féin appear to have benefited most from recent political events. Support for Fine Gael has climbed to 30 per cent, up six points, putting the party firmly in the driving seat to form the next government. Fine Gael s biggest gain up a whopping 13 points to 33 per cent has been among female voters. Greater numbers of middle-class (ABC1) voters (up eight points to 32 per cent) have also rowed in behind Fine Gael. Sinn Féin has registered a similar gain to that of Fine Gael, up seven points to 15 per cent, and the party s strongest performance ever in an Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll. No doubt Sinn Féin are riding a wave of publicity and popularity emanating from their recent byelection success in Donegal, but that may be too simplistic an explanation for this boost. In a time of unprecedented political turmoil and economic uncertainty, it could be expected that some voters would seek out a party further outside and to the left of the political mainstream. Labour have registered 25 per cent support, a drop of eight points since September. While Labour have fallen back somewhat, they are the second largest party by some distance and if Sinn Féin s gain has been, to an extent, at Labour s expense, the party may win back some of these switchers if Sinn Féin s vote retreats in the weeks ahead. It is interesting to note that Labour draws disproportionately on public sector workers for their support and no doubt the party will look to shore up support among this important group in advance of the 2011 general election. Currently, Labour is the number one party among public sector workers with 35 per cent support, followed by Fine Gael on 28 per cent, with Fianna Fáil attracting only 12 per cent of public sector votes. Independents/Others are on 11 per cent, their highest rating in over a year. It is worth noting that prior to this year combined support for Labour, Sinn Féin and Independents/Others had never, since polling began in 1982, exceeded the combined support for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. This changed in September 2010 when combined party support for Labour, Sinn Féin and Independents/Others broke through the 50 per cent barrier for the first time. And again in this latest poll the 50 per cent barrier has been breached. The centre of political gravity is shifting left, it seems. Translating poll findings into election results is fast becoming more art than science as more and more voters leave it until the last day or hour to make up their minds. Since 1983, Ipsos MORI has tracked how certain UK voters are of their party preference in the weeks and days before each general election. At the beginning of last year s UK election campaign, just 50 per cent of voters were definite about their choice, increasing to 69 per cent on the eve of the election. Three months out from an election, 64 per cent of Irish voters are definite about which party or Independent candidate will get their first preference. The flipside is that one in every three (34 per cent) of Irish voters have yet to make up their minds. We can expect this number to shrink as the election nears, but to grow in the years ahead if trends in UK voting behaviour are repeated in Ireland. From a polling perspective, what is perhaps more insightful is how individual party support divides between those definite in their choice and those less certain. For Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, more of their supporters are firm in their decision when compared to voters in general. For Labour however, just 55 per cent are definite about their intentions to vote Labour suggesting, maybe not surprisingly, a softer vote for a party which has seen enormous electoral gains over the past three years. With the general election fast approaching, the spotlight will shine more brightly than usual on party-leader performance. And what we will find, judging from today s poll at least, is that voters are generally underwhelmed by the political leadership on offer. Party-leader satisfaction ratings, when averaged across all leaders, have never been lower. Ratings for party leaders in this latest poll have fallen across the board: Brian Cowen down five points to 14 per cent; Enda Kenny down two points to 23 per cent; Eamon Gilmore down five points to 44 per cent; and John Gormley down five points to 13 per cent. Gerry Adams, who was recently selected to run as Sinn Féin s candidate in Louth, has almost managed to hold steady his performance rating, dropping just one rating point (to 28 per cent). Looking back over the past three years of poll data, it is clear that politics in Ireland has changed. Party loyalties have shifted massively and voters have become disillusioned with their political leadership and its ability to manage the country s affairs. But there is a sense from today s poll that the change has been more fundamental than we realise. We have hit our iceberg and some voters it seems are now less inclined to rearrange the political deckchairs and may be looking instead for a new political ship to board.",1,political,Irish pound devaluation,,,,ireland
809,Irish Independent,15/05/2015,It's time our politicians showed proper respect for the House - and each other,"DEPUTIES enjoy the Leaders' Questions slot in the Dáil, but for the wrong reasons. When this procedure was introduced a few years ago, some thought it would improve the standard of debate and make it easier for opposition party leaders to extract information from the government of the day. Instead, it has contributed to the debasement of the system. Deputies attend the Chamber in the hope of ""a good row"". Too often, they get what they wish for. Mind you, they have little difficulty finding occasions for good rows in addition to Leaders' Questions. The Dáil descends into disorder with dismaying frequency, sometimes when discussing issues on which there is no disagreement - like their notorious fondness for long holidays. But somehow, Leaders' Questions seems to attract the lightning with exceptional ease. Objection is raised to some fairly harmless remark. People raise their voices. Soon, it becomes impossible to hear what anyone says and the Ceann Comhairle is forced to suspend the sitting. After a while, they come back in, take up where they left off, or try to. Nothing of value emerges. Another sitting wasted. On Wednesday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny confronted two representatives of the far left, Deputies Paul Murphy and Ruth Coppinger. He told Deputy Murphy to ""toddle along"" to attend a briefing by representatives of Irish Water. Nowadays, almost any reference to Irish Water tends to annoy a great many people, and not just people with left-wing opinions. He would have done better not to say it. Ms Coppinger, for her part, asked what was the point of Leaders' Questions. Mr Kenny replied: ""It's to tell you where to go."" Again, he would have done better to have left it unsaid. The Taoiseach, of all people, should be at pains to uphold the dignity of parliament. The minor row blew over, as minor rows do. But Ms Coppinger had asked a very good question. Underneath that little squabble, and all the other little squabbles, lies something genuinely important and worrying. The present Government, like most of our previous governments, came into office promising ""openness, transparency and accountability"". Again, like most of its predecessors, it failed to deliver worthwhile reform. Not all of this failure was the fault of the Government. At various stages in his colourful and distinguished career, Deputy Alan Shatter has fought and won several one-man campaigns. He holds the record for having had no fewer than three private members' bills enacted. In recent times, independent deputies like Stephen Donnelly and Catherine Murphy have scored somewhat comparable successes. But Ms Murphy had to invoke the Freedom of Information procedure to get answers to her questions. It should have been possible for her to get the information she wanted merely by asking a Dáil question. Few deputies seem to have the courage or the competence to put in the research necessary to challenge a government backed by a huge bureaucracy which has little interest in reform. They are overwhelmed by a system which makes them almost powerless. Over the last few years - aided to some extent by the increase in the numbers of independent deputies - consciousness of the system's defects has increased. However, demands for specific reforms are not always well judged. For example, they often feature proposals for the abolition of party whips. This is misguided. Whips are necessary for the conduct of the Dáil's business. A far greater threat to democratic procedures is the guillotine. Most people are unaware that legislation - usually legislation brought in by the Government itself - is routinely guillotined. Important measures go through the Dáil after inadequate discussion, sometimes no discussion at all. The subject has come up frequently during the long and stuttering (and uncompleted) debate on the future of the Seanad. Advocates of reform have proposed an enhancement of the Seanad's role in debating and amending legislation. An excellent idea, provided that it does not take away from the primacy of the Dáil. But we still await the Government's proposals in the wake of its referendum defeat on the issue of abolition. By contrast, the Government was quick to react to two proposals from the constitutional commission. We face two referendums, on samesex marriage and on reducing the minimum age for the presidency to 21 from 35. We also face a by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny to fill the Dáil seat left vacant by the departure of Phil Hogan to Brussels. The political world takes far more interest in the by-election than it does in the referendums or in parliamentary reform. Here we have the red meat of Irish politics. Will a Fianna Fáil dynasty prevail? How will Lucinda Creighton's new party fare? Will the contest be so tight that it forces late-night recounts? Perhaps most to the point, will the results show a Fine Gael revival? All great fun, and mostly harmless fun. And so different from the recent sensational - and from the Irish viewpoint, dangerous - general election results which have given our nearest neighbour a government composed of a single party with an overall House of Commons majority. All the opinion polls got it wrong except for the exit poll which got it exactly right. And the speed with which we learned the outcome was almost as astounding as the results themselves. Since then, we have had plenty of time to reflect on the implications for Ireland. David Cameron is committed to holding a referendum on European Union membership during the lifetime of the new parliament: probably in 2017 but possibly in 2016. If Britain leaves the EU, the implications for Ireland will be profound. At best, there will be a period of great uncertainty. At worst, our economy will be damaged gravely and perhaps permanently. Pessimists already speculate about the possibility of Customs posts on the Northern Ireland border. It is far too early to frighten ourselves into nightmares like that. It is not too early to make such preparations as we can for the worst scenario - and the many other scenarios that could make their appearance. And it is not too early for a major Dáil debate. But what kind of debate? Will ministers and deputies behave with the necessary dignity? Will they cast aside the frivolity that characterises so much of our political system? Will they show respect for the magnitude of the issue - and for one another? In short, can the Government and the Dail rise to the occasion?

224,The Irish Times,16/10/2008,Canada elects Conservative minority as budget deficit looms,"A GAMBLE by Stephen Harper, Canada's prime minister, to call an early election and gain a strong mandate has failed, after he was handed another minority government - Canada's third in a row - on Tuesday. Mr Harper's Conservative party won 143 of 308 parliamentary seats, a rise of 16 on his party's pre-election standing. The largest opposition party, the Liberals, won 76 seats, down 19 from before the election. Amid economic uncertainty, Mr Harper's first task may be to prepare Canadians to accept the country's 11 consecutive budget surpluses may be coming to an end. Because of this record, a negative budget balance is taboo for the country's politicians. ""My resistance to running a deficit would be that history has shown there are no small deficits,"" Mr Harper said in Ottawa this month. That focus on maintaining a surplus meant the election campaign was devoid of discussion of deficit spending, in spite of an uncertain economic outlook. All five major parties pledged to keep Canada away from deficit. But many economists suggest the country will be unable to stay in surplus during 2009, thanks largely to slides in US markets, for which almost 80 per cent of Canadian exports are destined, and a recent fall in the price of oil. Mr Harper may also have to decide whether to respond to the growing number of western countries forced to guarantee their banks' equity. Canada's banks have remained stable so far. The five-week election campaign struggled to find relevancy for many Canadians. Mr Harper put himself forward as a steady hand to manage the economy. But a renewed minority and what looks to be the lowest voter turnout in Canadian history suggest that approach fell on deaf ears. Liberal leader Stéphane Dion will face questions about his leadership following his party's continued slide. Traditionally seen as Canada's ""natural"" governing party, the Liberals have lost significant support, and several contenders - including Harvard academic and television presenter Michael Ignatieff and former Ontario premier Bob Rae - are expected to push for change. A rare bright spot for the Liberals was the election of Justin Trudeau, son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, to represent a marginal district in the suburbs of Montreal. The continued success of the separatist Bloc Québécois - which won 50 seats in Quebec in spite of the dormant state of the independence movement - and the increasingly divided vote on the left make the quest for majority government an elusive one. - (Financial Times service)",0,,brexit,,,,
964,Irish Independent,20/07/2019,No-deal Brexit and us: An A to Z,"It's time to start thinking the unthinkable. Britain's prime minister-in-waiting Boris Johnson is insisting that Brexit must happen ""deal or no deal"". Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's new president, says there will be no renegotiation. But how will Ireland be affected if Britain crashes out at Halloween? Andrew Lynch brings the best and worst scenarios and some possible solutions that might help us to make the best of it Ais for AGRICULTURE The issue: No sector of Irish society has more to lose from a no-deal Brexit than the farming community. It would place crippling tariffs on sales of beef, dairy and poultry, with one EU report suggesting that the full cost could be (EURO)5.5bn between now and 2030. Worst-case scenario: Thousands of farms become economically unviable, dealing rural Ireland a blow that makes the loss of post offices and garda stations seem mild by comparison. Reason to hope: Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has set aside (EURO)700m in October's budget for vulnerable industries if no deal looks likely, which would at least cushion the initial blow. Bis for BORDER The issue: History suggests that any physical infrastructure along this 500km frontier will immediately become a target for republican groups. Boris Johnson, the favourite to become the new UK prime minister next week, has called it ""the tail wagging the dog"" and dismissed Irish concerns as ""pure millennium bug stuff"". ""It's so small and so few firms use that Border regularly,"" he told a meeting of business leaders last year, which must be news to the 6,000 commercial vehicles crossing between north and south every day. Worst-case scenario: Regulatory inspections are unavoidable and the first tangible legacy of Brexit is a dead customs officer. Reason to hope: The EU might just agree to suspend checks until a British-Irish trade deal is agreed. Cis for COST OF LIVING The issue: Higher tariffs are almost always passed on to the consumer - and not just for luxuries. One ESRI study has concluded that a no-deal Brexit would increase the price of bread and cereals by up to 30pc, with dairy products such as milk, cheese and eggs rocketing by 46pc. Worst-case scenario: The same survey estimated a 2-3pc hike in the cost of living for Irish households, which in real terms means between (EURO)892 and (EURO)1,360 per year. Reason to hope: At least people are apparently bracing themselves for the impact, since savings are at their highest for a decade. Dis for DATA The issue: When Britain leaves, the legal basis for everyday transfers of electronic data between it and EU countries goes too. Moreover, the guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU in 2017 would disappear - raising the prospect of huge holiday phone bills. Worst-case scenario: Irish banks and e-commerce businesses face a major security headache. Reason to hope: For now at least, Irish mobile operators have decided that reintroducing roaming charges for visitors to the UK would not be worth the loss of customer goodwill. Eis for ELECTRICITY The issue: Since 2007 there has been a Single Electricity Market across this island, underpinned by Ireland and the UK's joint EU membership. If that's split into two, the Government has warned, both markets will be ""less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the Border"". Worst-case scenario: Energy prices rise in the Republic, while Northern Ireland needs emergency supplies from offshore barges to stop the lights going out. Reason to hope: The Government's contingency plan promises to give the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities extra powers that will address ""any issues of non-compliance with EU law"". Fis for FLYING The issue: 'Air Head' was a headline in The Sun last July after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar allegedly threatened to ban British planes from Irish skies. While the story was nonsense, a no-deal Brexit would certainly cause some turbulence in the European aviation industry. Worst-case scenario: Irish passengers may no longer be able to use UK airlines for travel between EU countries, since those planes can only travel back to Britain. Reason to hope: Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said a ""skeleton arrangement"" could be put in place to let planes fly from British airports with their current safety certs, but even he admits it is ""not a pretty picture"". Continued on Page 4 Continued from Page 3 Gis for GOOD NEWS The issue: Amidst all the doom and gloom, it's easy to forget that a hard Brexit has upsides for Ireland, too. With Britain turning inwards, many global companies might be tempted to flee the City of London and set up shop in the Irish Financial and Services Centre instead. Worst-case scenario: The outlandish cost of housing in Dublin means we could lose investment opportunities to Brexit rivals such as Amsterdam. Reason to hope: If Britain elects a far-left Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn, it may cause a rush of capital flight across the Irish Sea. His for HOUSE PRICES The issue: Where would a no-deal Brexit take the Irish property market? ""Into the unknown"" was one less than reassuring answer from the Real Estate Alliance last December, while last week the Central Bank warned of a possible crash due to job losses and fire sales by cuckoo funds. Some areas could be particularly vulnerable: Border counties where locals would suffer from the loss of free movement, the high-end Dublin market where potential buyers rely on UK business and farming regions where the local economy will suffer most. Worst-case scenario: Thousands of homeowners are plunged back into negative equity. Reason to hope: Pent-up demand might help the market to flatten out instead, which most economists would regard as no bad thing. Iis for IRISH UNITY The issue: Recent opinion polls leave no room for doubt - Brexit has significantly increased support for a united Ireland among voters north and south. With the Scottish National Party busy planning a second independence referendum, the chances of a Border poll on this island before 2025 are also steadily rising. Worst-case scenario: A bitter and tribal referendum campaign only succeeds in making the north's sectarian divide even worse. Reason to hope: If moderate unionists begin feeling their loss of EU membership keenly, we might just be able to put the orange-green divide behind us once and for all. Jis for JOHNSON FACTOR The issue: ""Forget Boris Johnson, he's yesterday's person!"" Simon Coveney declared in a radio interview last September. Now he looks set to be tomorrow's person too. Johnson has claimed the chances of no deal are ""a million to one"", but it is no great secret that Irish government officials regard him as lazy, unreliable and reckless enough to do almost anything. Worst-case scenario: Boris drags Anglo-Irish relations down to their most fractious state since the 1970s. Reason to hope: Johnson might just be the one Brexiteer shameless enough to tell his supporters, ""Sorry chaps, look like it won't work after all - let's call the whole thing off."" Kis for KITKAT The issue: Ok, so this isn't exactly the biggest crisis facing Ireland in a no-deal scenario. Many of us with a sweet tooth, however, will have felt uneasy to learn that the Swiss food giants Nestlé recently warned our government about ""complications related to the importation of confectionery and other goods manufactured in the UK into Ireland"". Worst-case scenario: Irish children's selection boxes could be missing such iconic brands as Aero and Smarties next Christmas. Reason to hope: Boris Johnson has written about his own fondness for a KitKat, so perhaps this might bring him to his senses. Lis for LAW The issue: The UK's full-blown departure would create various legal problems for family disputes in particular. Divorces obtained in Britain or Northern Ireland will not be recognised in the Republic, custody cases could be split between two legal regimes and cross-border maintenance payments may no longer be guaranteed. Worst-case scenario: Confusion reigns and adds to Ireland's already sky-high legal fees. Reason to hope: The Government has promised that legislation is being prepared to deal with all these justice-related difficulties. Mis for MOTORING The issue: A no-deal Brexit has serious consequences for anyone with a driving licence. For a start, Britain will no longer be covered by the EU Motor Insurance Directive so any Irish motorist must get a Green Card before travelling there. The 100,000 Irish people who buy used cars from the UK every year must also think again, since they will be liable for 23pc VAT. Most worryingly of all, Ireland imports over 90pc of our petroleum products from the UK so any price hike would hit us hard. Worst-case scenario: The prohibitive costs of running a vehicle here could rise even further. Reason to hope: At least Irish car dealers should benefit from the UK import market's woes. Nis for NATURE The issue: Understandably, most Brexit discussions have focused on the immediate economic cost. However, the UK's opt-out from EU environmental directives could also pose a threat to our natural world. To take just one example, British zoos will be excluded from EU animal breeding programmes - hampering the conservation work being carried out by Dublin Zoo and Fota Wildlife Park. Worst-case scenario: Friends of the Earth are warning of the negative impact on Ireland's threatened species, hazardous waste and air pollution. Reason to hope: Climate change awareness is growing all the time, so there should be intense pressure to restore all-island standards as soon as possible. Ois for ONLINE RETAIL The issue: Internet shopping has become a way of life for many Irish consumers. Following Brexit, however, any item over (EURO)22 bought from a British retailer will be subject to VAT and customs duties will be slapped on imports over (EURO)150. It will also become more difficult to return unwanted goods since excise duties paid must be reclaimed directly from the Revenue Commissioners. Worst-case scenario: The arrival of an Amazon package means getting out your credit card yet again. Reason to hope: At least the beleaguered Irish high street might regain a few customers. Pis for PENSIONS The issue: An EU without Britain could make planning for your retirement even more complicated. The last three budgets have all added a fiver to the state contributory pension, but Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty says this can't be guaranteed next October because Brexit is causing too much uncertainty. As for its impact on pension funds, anyone with assets in sterling should expect at least some short-term volatility. Worst-case scenario: If Brexit pushes us into recession, the Government's promise to introduce auto-enrolment pensions by 2022 may be postponed or even scrapped. Reason to hope: Most politicians are terrified of 'the grey vote' and will be reluctant to antagonise anyone past retirement age. Qis for QUALITY The issue: While trade tariffs can often be paid online, food products must be physically inspected to make sure that they meet the required EU standard. Last week Simon Coveney admitted for the first time that a no-deal Brexit will mean veterinary checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland into the Republic, looking out for inferior produce such as chlorinated chicken. He is still being coy, however, about exactly where they might take place. Worst-case scenario: Congestion, delays, extra bureaucracy and general disruption to cross-Border trade. Reason to hope: Leo Varadkar has suggested that the island of Ireland could be treated as a single economic zone for agricultural trade - and, surprisingly, the DUP are not ruling it out. Ris for ROCKALL The issue: Last month's war of words between Irish and Scottish ministers over fishing rights surrounding a lump of granite 260 miles off Donegal has temporarily quietened down. The fact remains, however, that Irish trawlers take roughly a third of their catch from UK waters and this will be under threat once Britain has left the Common Fisheries Policy. Worst-case scenario: Sean O'Donoghue, CEO of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, says a hard border down the Irish Sea could ""absolutely destroy"" many coastal businesses. Reason to hope: The EU has put forward proposals both to financially compensate our fishing industry and offer two-way access to Irish and UK waters for a limited period. Frankly, it's hard to see one here - although mobile inspection units might relieve the pressure. Sis for SHORTAGES The issue: Around two-thirds of the products on Irish supermarket shelves come from Britain. Almost 70pc of our medical supplies have the same origin. With reports of stockpiling over there already, there are bound to be shortages - not so bad if it's breakfast cereal, a lot more serious if it's blood pressure tablets. Worst-case scenario: Hearing the words, ""Sorry, we've run out already,"" becomes a daily occurrence. Reason to hope: ""Nobody will go hungry,"" Leo Varadkar has promised - and people will hold him to it. Tis for TOURISM The issue: The Irish hospitality sector relies heavily on British visitors, with roughly 3.5m of them spending around (EURO)1.3bn here every year. A no-deal Brexit will almost certainly hit sterling hard, however, which in turn makes us less attractive as a holiday destination. Worst-case scenario: Fáilte Ireland's chief executive Paul Kelly warned an Oireachtas committee last November that the price tag could be as much as (EURO)390m. Reason to hope: The Government may try developing other markets or reversing the tourism sector's recent VAT rate hike from 9pc to 13.5pc. Uis for UNEMPLOYMENT The issue: Paschal Donohoe is not bothering to sugar-coat it. The Minister for Finance estimates that a no-deal Brexit could cost Ireland between 50,000 and 55,000 jobs over the next two years, with another 30,000 at risk in the medium term. Once again agriculture would be the sector hardest hit, although workers in the textile, beverages and traditional manufacturing industries should also be extremely worried. Worst-case scenario: The dream of full employment, so tantalisingly close today, is put out of Ireland's reach for a decade or longer. Reason to hope: Simon Coveney has claimed, ""We're probably going to be gaining a similar number [of jobs] in other parts of the economy… the net unemployment figure probably won't increase."" is for VOTING The issue: ""If it wasn't for Brexit, ye'd be Vgone,"" Fianna Fáil's Barry Cowen told Fine Gael TDs last February. Brexit has been the glue holding this government together for a long time, but if Britain crashes out then Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin's 'confidence and supply' arrangement will have no reason to continue. The Taoiseach's chances of re-election could be severely damaged, with the backstop he called ""bullet-proof"" shot to pieces and no shortage of people telling him his strategy was wrong all along. Worst-case scenario: Another hung Dáil and another weak minority administration just when the country needs decisive leadership. Reason to hope: Any party that seizes the day with a clear vision for post-Brexit Ireland would surely earn the voters' gratitude. Wis for WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION The issue: This is the Brexit dilemma in a nutshell. By leaving both the single market and customs union, Britain would automatically start trading under WTO rules with tariffs that average out at 22pc and go up to 60pc in the case of flour. Boris Johnson has suggested an interim deal under the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) model - but that doesn't apply to services and it can be vetoed by other WTO members anyway. Worst-case scenario: A 21st-century version of the 1930s Anglo-Irish Economic War. Reason to hope: There's an outside chance that the WTO will waive tariffs for six months or so to give both sides time to adjust. Xis for X-RAY The issue: One of Boris Johnson's most contentious claims is that a hard Irish Border can be avoided purely by using IT methods such as GPS, drones and X-ray scanners. ""Crazy stuff"" was the verdict of one Irish government source when these alleged solutions were outlined in a document by pro-Brexit MPs last September. Virtually every expert agrees that the technology needed simply hasn't been invented yet. Worst-case scenario: Prime Minister Boris insists it will be 'all right on the night' and isn't proved wrong until it's too late. Reason to hope: There's always a chance that some miracle cure will be discovered just in time. Yis for YELLOWHAMMER The issue: 'I'm a civil servant. Trust me, we're nowhere near ready for no-deal Brexit'. That was the headline on an anonymous Guardian article last February about Operation Yellowhammer, the British civil service's emergency plan. It sounds like complete chaos, which is deeply worrying for the Merrion Street mandarins who will be trying to protect Irish interests while negotiating with Whitehall. Worst-case scenario: To quote that civil servant again, ""a screenwriter will one day pitch a mockumentary about this as The Office meets the Poseidon Adventure with a Benny Hill soundtrack."" Reason to hope: As the great English man of letters Samuel Johnson once said, nothing concentrates a man's mind so much as the knowledge that he will be hanged in a fortnight. is for ZZZZZZZ... ZThe issue: When Simon Coveney described last week's updated Brexit plan as ""a wake-up call"", he chose his words carefully. As the Government is now constantly warning, too many Irish businesses are not making the necessary preparations (such as registering with customs authorities) because they assume a no-deal Brexit simply can't happen. They may end up sleepwalking to disaster as a result. Worst-case scenario: On Halloween, sceptics discover that the Brexit boogeyman really does exist. Reason to hope: ""Look deep into our eyes,"" Boris Johnson recently said, ""and think 'My god, these Brits actually are going to leave."" How many people can honestly say they think he is bluffing? The Irish hospitality sector relies heavily on British visitors, with roughly 3.5m of them spending around (EURO)1.3bn here every year ; ;",1,trade,,,,,uk
942,The Irish Times,15/04/2002,"Needed: a return to tighter fiscal policies after election is out of wayIn the first part of a series looking at the how the fruits of the Tiger economy were spent, Brendan Walsh examines the public finances, as an extraordinary period of lower tax and rising Exchequer spending comes to an end","The end-of-millennium year 2000 was the most buoyant in modern Irish history. The economy expanded by over 10 per cent, the number of people at work increased by 5 per cent and the unemployment rate dropped below 4 per cent for the first time. The public finances were in robust good health. Tax revenue grew by an amazing 17 per cent. Current spending increased in real terms but declined as a percentage of GNP to the lowest level recorded since the early 1960s. The Government surplus reached 4.7 per cent of GNP, compared with a target of only 1.5 per cent. The debt/GNP ratio continued to plummet. 02041500064 During this annus mirabilis, the Department of Finance was anxious to defer tax receipts and play down the seemingly unending flow of good financial news. Such caution was warranted because of the euphoria generated by the protracted boom. For example, some believed that building a billion-pound sports complex in west Dublin would not compete with eliminating infrastructure deficits in road and the health system. Inevitably Budget 2001, unveiled in December 2000, contained a utopian combination of major tax cuts and spending increases. The economic problem of scarcity seemed to have been banished from Ireland. A sea change occurred in the course of 2001. The public finances began to deteriorate rapidly. The most important reason for this was the sharp fall in the economy's growth rate, which may have reached zero towards the end of the year. Whereas Budget 2001 had projected a 12 per cent rise in tax revenue, the outcome was an increase of only 2 per cent. The ratio of tax to GNP fell by two percentage points in the course of the year (Figure 1). The way tax buoyancy evaporated during 2001 suggested that something more than the direct effects of the economic slowdown was at work. The responsiveness of economic activity to tax cuts appeared to have run its course. Mr McCreevy's oft-proclaimed belief that conventional economics is irrelevant in the Irish situation seemed to be based largely on this phenomenon. In 2001 his luck ran out. While spending on debt service continues to decline relative to GNP, spending under the other main headings is now rising more rapidly than national production. Between 1994 and 1999, day-to-day spending as a percentage of GNP was on a gentle downward slope, but it levelled off in 2000 and this year is likely to be back to its 1994 level. This reversal is the most troublesome factor behind the recent deterioration in the public finances after 2000. The biggest cause for concern is the rapid growth in public-sector pay due to the increasing numbers employed and rising pay scales. Not surprisingly, when Mr McCreevy delivered his Budget 2002 speech in December 2001 his mood was markedly less ebullient than it had been a year earlier. ""There is no point in wishful dreaming,"" he warned. He revised the projected Government surpluses for both 2001 and 2002 downwards by 3 per cent GNP. Only by appropriating revenue equal to over 1 per cent of GNP from the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Social Insurance Fund was he able to avoid projecting a deficit for 2002. While the pattern of spending and tax receipts is unusually difficult to interpret this year, there are no signs of an improvement in the underlying situation from the returns for the first quarter. Most commentators now doubt that the small projected surplus cobbled together by the Minister last December will be achieved. The full extent of the recent change in the prospects for the public finances is revealed in the projections for 2003. In Budget 2001 a surplus of 4.6 per cent was projected for 2003, but in Budget 2002 this was replaced by a projected deficit of 0.5 per cent. Even allowing for the uncertain nature of these projections, a downward revision amounting to over 5 per cent of GNP in the course of a year is remarkable. Inevitably the fall in tax receipts and continued momentum of current and capital spending have led to a large drop in the Government's surplus. It is now likely that the overall balance will move into deficit this year after six successive surpluses from 1996 to 2001. On current projections, by 2003 the deficit will have risen to the level last seen in 1996. However, the scale of the projected borrowing is modest by comparison with the unsustainable levels reached in the 1980s. The golden rule of not borrowing for current spending is unlikely to be breached, and the fiscal balance excluding interest payments should remain in surplus. These features of the situation reassure us that the debt/GNP ratio will continue to decline, although not at the dizzying rate of the late 1990s. Moreover, by comparison with the larger economies of the euro zone - Germany, in particular - Ireland's public finances remain in good shape despite the recent deterioration. But even if the macroeconomic ratios are not yet sending out any alarm signals, there is no room for complacency. The public mood belatedly caught up with the boom of the late 1990s and the healthy state of the public finances it produced. The perceived strength of the public finances is now incessantly invoked to support calls for higher public spending and spending ministers are less inclined to argue the case for restraint. Many influential commentators have persuaded themselves that Ireland is now an exceptionally lightly taxed nation. Based on comparisons with the northern European club of the most highly taxed nations in the world, the idea has been sold that we could easily solve a range of problems simply by raising the ratio of public spending relative to GNP. Never mind that the tax burden is still higher than it was in the 1960s or that single people on average pay face a combined PAYE and PRSI tax of 48 per cent on additional income, the political message is ""tax and spend more"" or just ""spend more"". Little credence is given to the likelihood that higher spending will be dissipated in a larger pay bill rather than providing better services. To his credit Mr McCreevy has tried to resist these pressures and to link increased spending to greater efficiency. But despite his misgivings about the ""tax and spend"" philosophy he has not been able to avert a rise in current spending relative to GNP. The philosophy that served the economy well during the second half of the 1990s has become a causality of the psychology of the boom years and electoral politics. We need a rapid return to tighter fiscal policies as soon as the election is out of the way.

292,Irish Independent,11/04/2016,Coalition talks and inflation take spotlight,"WILL we get a government this week? It's easy to dismiss this as a political question and point out that the country has been managing fine in the six weeks we haven't had anything more than a nominal taoiseach. But there are growing signs that things aren't getting done because there is nobody in a position to sign off on decisions. Last week developer Richard Barrett warned his Bartra Capital was holding off plans to build social housing until he knew what the Government would be, while there is growing disquiet in Government departments about the lack of things being signed off by ministers. As talks between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail ramp up, it is becoming more and more clear - we need a government formed or an election. Away from Ireland, with the world economy entering a more uncertain phase and the top central banks sounding ever more cautious, attention may turn in the coming week to signs of whether years of aggressive stimulus have yielded any significant rise in inflation. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank all have been disappointed to varying degrees about how little inflation has picked up, or indeed how it has spent too much time going the opposite way. It seems the fall in unemployment in the United States and Britain, and to a lesser extent the euro zone, is starting to slow. In the euro zone, where the European Central Bank just delivered an unexpectedly large dose of extra stimulus, growth has been holding up relatively well, but progress in getting the unemployment rate down has also slowed. Euro zone inflation is expected to be confirmed at -0.1pc, well short of its goal of just under 2pc. If that itself weren't enough of a worry, the euro, like the yen, is stubbornly rallying just when central bank policymakers have delivered stimulus with the hope of spurring on export performance and importing inflation from abroad. This suggests to many experts that central banks are near or at the end of their policy reach. The start of the US company earnings season is also set to kick off, with hopes abound that a reprieve from the dollar's climb may improve the outlook after one of the most volatile starts to a year ever.",0,,,,,,
688,The Irish Times,18/10/2008,Government's optimism may prove to be misguided,"Opinion:The Budget's projected exchequer figures are based on unrealistic assumptions, says Garret Fitzgerald IT SEEMS to me that this is an optimistic Budget. I don't mean there is anything cheerful about it, but rather that it displays a lot of optimism on the part of the Government about our future prospects. Let me first address this issue. The Budget indicates that in the absence of economic growth, our exchequer deficit in 2011 could be as high as EUR 19 billion, but the Government is projecting for that year a deficit of just under EUR 6 billion. How do they suggest that this will be achieved and how realistic are the assumptions on which these figures are based? First, a comparison with the data for future capital spending that was contained in last year's budget reveals that the Government has decided to cut capital spending in future years by about EUR 1.5 billion, or one-eighth. This was not mentioned in this week's Budget speech, nor was the amount or type of these cuts identified in the Budget documentation. All I have been able to determine is that a very large proportion of the reduction is to be in transport, but the Dáil has not been told what postponements or cancellations are proposed to secure this outcome. Next, the Government believes that the value of our national output will grow by just over 10 per cent between 2009 and 2011, and on this basis, they have built in to their calculations over EUR 4 billion additional tax revenue in the last year. It is probably right to assume some rise in tax revenue by that time, but this figure may turn out to have been optimistic. The Government has also decided to eliminate from its expenditure provision the EUR 1.75 billion contingency that in recent years has always been incorporated in the budget. Dropping this provision is a sleight of hand - to which, once again, no reference was made in the Budget speech. (The only hint of such a change to be found in the documentation is a blank space at the point where this figure used to appear.) In view of the huge uncertainties that exist about our future financial situation, it would have made much more sense to have increased this contingency allowance rather than to drop it. Finally, for a number of complex reasons, the general government deficit that is used by the EU and the European Central Bank to measure our financial performance is usually a billion or so lower than the figure that emerges from our own budget arithmetic - the exchequer balance. This year's Budget documentation states that they expect this differential in our favour to rise to EUR 2.6 billion by 2011, which would relieve the pressure on our finances. Together, these four factors would, according to the Government, reduce the 2011 budget deficit to just over EUR 9 billion. So, the Government believes that to get the 2011 deficit down to below EUR 6 billion, it will need to raise additional revenue or cut expenditure to produce a further EUR 3.3 billion. However, the additional amount they will need to find in 2010 and 2011 may turn out to be greater than that. For economic growth may not match up to the Government's expectations, and the decision to eliminate the contingency of EUR 1.75 billion may prove to have been unwise. Even if the Government's revenue expectations prove to be realistic, it remains to be seen how much of their estimated EUR 3.3 billion shortfall can be found by expenditure cuts. If savings in spending were run to no more than EUR 1 billion to EUR 1.5 billion, as is clearly possible, it would then be necessary to increase tax revenue by a second bout of EUR 2 billion during the period from 2010 to 2011. So much for the Government's projections out to the year 2011. A different issue is the decision to use what many people have been led by pre-Budget leaks to believe was a temporary levy to fill a permanent loss of revenue from asset-related taxes arising from property transactions. There is nothing temporary about this income levy, and, whatever about pre-Budget leaks, the fact is that it was not described as temporary in the Budget speech. It would not have cost much to have excluded people with very low incomes from this levy. I estimate that about one-fifth of taxpayers have incomes of less than EUR 7,500, and their exclusion from the scheme would have trimmed the revenue from the Government's EUR 2 billion tax increases by only about EUR 25 million - little more than 1 per cent of the total. That would have been a very small price to pay for relieving this large group of the very poorest taxpayers from a levy that they cannot afford to pay. With regard to the abolition of the entitlement of over-70s to a medical card, the ham-fisted way that this scheme was introduced some years ago, without preparation, made it absurdly costly. In its post-announcement negotiations with GPs about the fees to be paid for this service, the Government proved itself to be incompetent as the level of payments agreed was excessive. Finally, on the issue of public service staff numbers, contrary to a widespread view, these are generally not out of line with the needs of a country of our size. But there are some areas where numbers are excessive, eg the Health Service Executive. That body took over the functions of the former health boards, which had an excessive number of administrators. The Government had an opportunity then to effect major staff savings, but once again, because of its incapacity to negotiate effectively with interest groups, it agreed with the trade unions that all the surplus administrative staff - many of whom are very highly paid - would be retained, regardless of whether there would be work for many of them to do. The Minister for Finance told us in his Budget speech that on top of that excessive level of administrative staff, the HSE has since been allowed to recruit a further 1,900 administrators. Only now has the Government finally plucked up the courage to lance this boil. How many tens of millions will it now cost to introduce what the Minister described as a ""targeted voluntary early retirement scheme""? And how many staff members will in fact volunteer for these payments? If many do not, are they to remain on the HSE payroll?",0,,,,,,
801,The Irish Times,15/04/2017,"IS THERE ONE? IS IT GETTING BOOMIER?; The Central Bank's chief economist says a 'Phoenix miracle' is at hand, but few are feeling it","Talk of the economic recovery being a ""Phoenix miracle"" has made it to Dundrum Town Centre, but even in the country's biggest shopping centre the view among shoppers is that the term is not a proper fit. ""I heard that the other day,"" says a surprised Anna Howard, outside the House of Fraser department store, referring to the phrase used last week by Central Bank chief economist Gabriel Fagan. ""Maybe people who have money feel like they can spend it again and people who don't are still being cautious.""  ""A miracle it definitely isn't,"" adds Anna's mother Jacqueline. ""There's a lot more confidence in people that have money or didn't lose their fortune. They have confidence in moving forward again, but there's a lot of people left behind. People at the lower income levels don't feel the recovery."" Emma (26) from Rathfarnham is carrying shopping bags on her way out of the south Dublin shopping centre and checking her phone. ""I wouldn't call it miraculous,"" she says of the bounce-back in the economy. ""There is definitely a bit of confidence back but I wouldn't say that it is thriving.""  Still, she is experiencing a recovery first-hand in her work in banking and finance. She has just been contacted again by a headhunter trying to recruit her to a new role. ""I feel like if I lost my job tomorrow I would definitely be able to go out and get an interview in the next couple of days.""  So things are looking up but no economic apparitions have been spotted in public. The term ""Phoenix miracle"" is not Fagan's; it was coined by Guillermo Calvo, the Argentine-American economics professor at Columbia University in New York, to describe an economy that rises rapidly from the ashes of recession, creating new jobs and attracting new investment but without any rise in debt.  Calvo conceived the model after analysing the Asian economic crises of the 1990s, and spotted that the US experienced a similar recovery after the Great Depression with plenty of growth but no new credit. Sitting in a boardroom of the Central Bank's swanky new offices on the north quays in Dublin, Fagan says that his intention was not to create a new term to rival the overused ""Celtic Tiger"" or even the more recent ""Celtic Phoenix"" of fictional Irish Times columnist Ross O'Carroll-Kelly. ""It was just simply to say, when we look at the economy, this is a phenomenon that has been observed elsewhere.""  We may not be back in a credit bubble but the economy seems - to borrow a phrase from Bertie Ahern (although he used the word ""boomer"") - to be getting boomier. Crane-counting on the Dublin skyline is back, house prices are rising by up to 9 per cent nationally and 10.2 per cent in Dublin (says Irish Times-owned property website MyHome.ie and stockbrokers Davy) and couples are camping overnight in cars to be first in line to buy new houses.  Fagan points to inward investment and employment growth as examples of the miraculous recovery. More than 200,000 jobs have been created since 2012, making Ireland ""the envy of Europe"". Unemployment has fallen from a high of 15.1 per cent in 2012 to 6.4 per cent in March. He sees 90,000 more jobs being created this year and next. Exclude the construction sector, which is still recovering after its collapse, and employment is back roughly where it was at its peak in the mid-2000s.  Calamitous place  This hardly amounts to a boom given that it is just about repairing the damage done since the crash and returning from a calamitous place. While foreign direct investment and US multinationals drove much of the employment growth early in the recovery, the wave of new jobs has spread to different parts of the economy, with the latest Central Statistics Office figures showing employment increasing across all sectors. The rising tide has led the Central Bank to raise both its forecast for wage increases and economic growth this year and next.  From the Central Bank's new front door at Spencer Dock, you can see 14 building cranes around you. Fagan says the activity in the commercial property sector should not be taken as a warning sign of a potential return to the unsustainable property-driven credit-fuelled splurge that sank the economy almost a decade ago.  Commercial property development is being largely funded by investors from abroad, he says; banks are behaving themselves having got burned, learned their lessons and tightened their lending standards. Financial supervision has improved and banks are ""being kept on a tight leash"" by the Central Bank. Loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratio restrictions on mortgage lending is keeping a lid on excessive lending. ""It is unlikely that we will repeat the mistakes of the past, but it cannot be guaranteed,"" says Fagan from a boardroom that overlooks a hulking frame of new building under construction next door. ""If there are changes that are made in response to some of the pressures to policy,"" he adds, alluding to the government policies that helped inflate the Celtic Tiger bubble, ""it poses risks so we should not become complacent."" A Central Bank economist's use of the phrase ""Phoenix miracle"" has raised eyebrows, not least among other economists. Some worry that, notwithstanding the accuracy of the term, it may create some complacency that Fagan is warning against, particularly given the risks facing the economy: from the UK exiting the European Union and the potential impact of US corporate tax reform on Ireland's multinational employers to the housing crisis, the high level of debt and the concentrated nature of the tax base. ""If you use a strict definition, yes, we have seen the stock in credit fall, and yet the economy is growing,"" says Dermot O'Leary, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers.  ""But it is a little bit dangerous because it may bring about an attitude that everything is very rosy whereas if you look at where the risks are at the moment there are still significant ones. It is somewhat dangerous as to what it does to the psychology of thinking around how sustainable the recovery is.""  The shortage of new housing units after years of inactivity in the construction sector lays bare one of the biggest problems facing the economy. The Housing Agency has said that 81,000 new homes are needed by 2020 to meet projected demand. Just under 15,000 new homes were completed last year, and work began on another 13,234 homes, so the country is falling well short.  This explains why house prices are increasing so quickly in an illiquid market and why average rents rose 13.5 per cent in 2016 - their highest level on record - and are climbing faster since property website Daft.ie first began tracking rental prices in 2002.There is still also a heavy debt hangover in Irish households from the boom and bust as they continue to try to solve past mistakes.  Debt as a proportion of income was reduced by the highest amount of any country in the European Union last year, but Irish households were still the fourth most indebted in the EU. Likewise, small businesses are still paying off legacy debt and are not confident enough to borrow. ""Whilst we are certainly not in bubble territory, the fact that credit is contracting is not something we should be patting ourselves on the back about,"" said Davy economist Conall Mac Coille. The mortgage market is not yet back to what is considered normal levels as more debt is being paid off than being drawn down. Residential mortgages totalled EUR 5.6 billion last year, according to Bank and Payments Federation Ireland, still below a level that economists consider a normal market. Increases in approvals suggest this could reach EUR 10 billion by 2020, according to a conservative Davy estimate.  Increasing house prices driven by the shortage of properties on the market and easing borrowing rules will also help to drive up debt levels. Fagan expects the overall stock of loans to start growing again within the next year or two. ""We are close enough now if you look at growth rates,"" he says. Outstanding debts are, for many, still a big part of the problem, however, and the recovery in this area has been far from miraculous. Some 77,493 home mortgages (out of a total 738,506 in the country) had fallen behind on repayments at the end of last year, Central Bank data shows. A rising market is curing some bad mortgages but there are still many hopeless cases where people will inevitably have to leave homes, including some of the worst cases: there are 33,447 mortgages in arrears for two years or more. ""There is a big difference between now and 2014, so cases that we saw as being pretty hopeless in 2014 are now solvable because there is more activity, more people working, more people better off,"" said Ross Maguire, chief executive of New Beginnings, which helps people struggling with their mortgages. ""That doesn't apply across the board. I think there is a rump of 5,000 to 10,000 cases that can never be solved because of non-economic factors such as age - people are too old to repay large mortgages - marital break-up and people whose income is never going to go back to where it was."" While the recovery is broadly based in that jobs are being created in sectors across the economy, it has not been evenly spread. The majority of the new jobs created over the last four years are higher-skilled positions, being filled by candidates with third-level qualification.  Homelessness campaigner Fr Peter McVerry gets annoyed with terms like ""Phoenix miracle"" when homelessness is at record levels and 7,100 people are seeking emergency accommodation, including working people who simply cannot afford their mortgages or skyrocketing rents.  ""The recovery has left a lot of people behind and they are not just poor people. These are people who have worked hard, done all they were told that would make them successful. Those who are being left behind who read that will just feel more and more that they don't count and their perspective is irrelevant to government and policies being pursued in this recovery."" Dr Seán Healy, director of think tank and advocacy group Social Justice Ireland, takes issue with economic analysis skewed by foreign investment at a time when a major programme of investment in social housing and rural broadband is required and there are 91,000 people on housing waiting lists.  ""We have serious questions about the measurement of growth, GDP and so on, and the idea that we have delivered this miracle rings very hollow to a very high percentage of people in Ireland.""  Fagan acknowledges the main beneficiaries of the economic recovery are people finding jobs again. ""It doesn't mean when we say a broadly-based recovery that everyone is benefiting from the recovery - it just means that it is spread across different sectors.""  Pursestrings loosening  Even those who have gained from the ""Phoenix miracle"" are watching their money and being more circumspect about their spending, unwilling to get stung like others did in the past. Businesses that rely on consumer confidence and higher disposable income spending told The Irish Times that people have started spending again but not like before. They are instead more discerning and careful with their money. New car sales last year reached 142,988, their highest level since 2008, but purchases of ""171-reg"" cars are down this year, though still healthy at levels recorded in 2015.  Gavin Hydes, chief executive of Joe Duffy Motors, which operates 12 car dealers in Dublin, Meath and Limerick, believes car sales have been affected by uncertainty about the future and concerns about Brexit. Restaurants appear to be enjoying greater confidence in short-term consumer spending, he says. ""Cars are a bigger purchase. Anything that affects the medium term affects car sales because it is a medium-term acquisition.""  At Chapter One on Parnell Square in Dublin, one of 12 Michelin-starred restaurants in the country, chef Ross Lewis says he has seen ""a little bit of extra volume"" in business, including returning customers whom he has not seen for a while.  ""I can see people getting a little bit more confident and slightly spending up a bit,"" he says, ""but I wouldn't see them going crazy. People are going EUR 5 or EUR 10 up on a bottle of wine.""  Wild sums   Peter Dunne, director of Mitchell & Son Wine Merchants in the IFSC in Dublin, says people are shelling out more on whiskey and gin but not the wild sums they spent on wine during the boom years.  ""It was out of control almost what people were prepared to spend on wine for a special dinner. Those days are not completely gone but it is not noticeable that they are on the way back.""  In the art world, Mandy Williams, director of the Oriel Gallery in Dublin, says that sales are up and there are lots of new clients, but there are fewer impulse purchases like during the Celtic Tiger years; customers won't spend vast sums on paintings they are unlikely to make money back on at a later date.  ""They want to know the history of the picture. They just want to be comfortable,"" she says. ""There is no problem spending money, but they just want to be more cautious."" On the art auction side, James O'Halloran, managing director of Adam's Auctioneers, has noticed more optimism among buyers and more traffic, particularly from new customers such as young doctors and lawyers. However, he has not seen a huge increase in prices being paid. ""There is less risk-taking. People are looking at works by artists within what they would see as safe parameters. They want to know if things went south in the next little while again they wouldn't be left standing with something that nobody wants.""  Tailor Louis Copeland reports that sales are up 7-10 per cent on last year across his six shops, and that he has even seen property developers who were ""out there years ago"" starting ""to trickle back a little bit"". ""In no way is it back to where it was in 2005 or 2007, but every year it is increasing. There is certainly a lot of positively out there. You get a few good weeks and then you get a kick in the balls and it dies. It is up and down."" Christopher Andrews, operations director of Weir and Sons jewellers on Grafton Street and in Dundrum, says that sales volumes have fallen slightly but people are still spending and sales values are up. ""People have more money than they had a year ago, but they are not necessarily spending it with us. Last year they were spending more on cars. This year they might be spending it on something else, maybe property."" Andrews says ""Phoenix miracle"" is a ""nice soundbite"" but he feels it will take the retail sector longer to feel it than other parts of the economy. ""There is a good story there in Ireland compared with back in 2012 and 2013. The country does seem to be sorting itself out and coming back strongly."" Fagan says the Celtic Tiger ""mutated"" into a credit-fuelled property bubble but the country's underlying economic model that emerged in the 1990s based on inward investment, integration in the global economy and exports has remained sound and helped the Irish economy recover.  ""We are extremely lucky - we got away with it,"" he says. ""If you look at other countries - don't forget Phoenix comes from Greek mythology - there is no Phoenix miracle in Greece, and some of the other crisis countries are not experiencing strong growth.""",1,fiscal,,,,,ireland
1299,Irish Independent,17/06/2021,The fear is banks' nerve will burn-up on economic re-entry,"IF there is a silver lining to the economic shock brought on by the Covid- 19 pandemic, it is that the financial system has not contributed to the crisis. In fact, unlike in 2008 when a ""credit crunch"" plunged the global economy into a tailspin, banks have played a supportive role through the pandemic rather than making everything worse. As the Central Bank's most recent Financial Stability Review makes clear, banks absorbed some losses last year, which hurt their profitability, but they did not amplify the problems in the economy. On the contrary, they used their abundant capital to help borrowers through tough times. Along with generous Government financial supports, these efforts helped cushion the hardship experienced by households and businesses over the last 15 months. But the trickiest part of this downturn may be yet to come. Relative to six months ago, the degree of uncertainty around downside risks has diminished and there is now a clearer path to economic recovery. Yet as the country reopens and commerce returns to ""normal"", the true scale of financial damage is going to become clearer as the Government withdraws financial support, potentially causing an exit shock that draws in the banking sector. How might this happen? As the Central Bank analysis shows, credit supply hasn't tightened that much during the pandemic and Ireland isn't an outlier in Europe as it was during the financial crisis. That's good. It means the banking system is working as intended by handing out umbrellas when it's raining. However, as Government supports start to taper, what the Central Bank calls ""latent borrower distress"" could reveal itself. As the Government steps away, businesses and consumers will naturally look to the banks for working capital or access to personal credit. The concern, as expressed by Central Bank Governor Gabriel Makhlouf, is that banks will see that distress and lose their appetite for lending, cut back on risk exposures, and choke off the recovery. Add in a global repricing of risk on financial markets or even a standard correction to valuations and you could easily see a reflexive tightening of domestic credit supply. And while Mr Makhlouf has said nobody will gain from maintaining unviable busi- nesses on life support, he also expects lenders to think carefully about the impact on borrowers of their credit policies. The X-factor in all this is what happens to the billions in savings accumulated by Irish households during the pandemic. The Central Bank expects some of it to wash back into the economy, but it won't fully replace Government supports euro by euro or, more importantly, sector by sector. Where people choose to spend might not match sectors where supports are most needed today. Right now Irish banks are well-capitalised and have access to abundant liquidity from customer deposits, financial markets and the European Central Bank. They are primed to lend. Apart from mortgages, though, demand is pretty tepid, especially among SMEs. The lack of risk appetite at the moment is a problem of borrowers, not banks. The question is how banks respond to a reversal of that dynamic in the next six months. Graphic   Central Bank Governor Gabriel Makhlouf",0,,economic recovery,,,,
916,The Irish Times,11/03/2017,"MODERN IRISH SCANDALS; The conditions that created the Tuam mother-and-baby home scandal continue today in the form of unaccountable authorities, misplaced values and warped priorities","It's the details of the stories that shock: children growing up in institutions in grinding poverty, vulnerable youngsters damaged or dead after falling through the cracks of a system, young mothers unable to live in their family homes.  The era of mother-and-baby homes or today's Ireland?  The scandal of the Tuam mother-and-baby home dominated headlines again this week, accompanied by a suffocating shame at what was allowed to happen in this country. As we struggle to absorb the gravity of that situation it's tempting to comfort ourselves with the idea that State-sanctioned mistreatment of citizens is historic.  ""We had better deal with this now,"" Taoiseach Enda Kenny told the Dáil, ""because if we do not some other Taoiseach will be standing here in 20 years, saying, 'If only we knew then,' 'If only we had done then.' What will be his or her then is our now. Now we do know."" Yet very modern scandals are unfolding in the here and now under the watch of the State. They are not newly unearthed revelations. They have not convulsed our political establishment. Nor have they jolted a society baffled at the warped values of a previous generation.  In a sense the legacy of Tuam - and our wider history of coercive confinement - casts a shadow that is still here in the form of unaccountable authorities, misplaced values and warped priorities. There is still a mindset that vulnerable people are largely responsible for their own problems and misfortunes. How else to explain ongoing scandals about the treatment of, and responsibility for, children who are damaged in our care system, of children whose potential is squandered while they wait for vital therapies, or those who spend their childhoods in our bleak and dehumanising direct-provision system?  Danny Talbot  When they combed through Danny Talbot's belongings at the hostel where he lived, everything fitted in a single black plastic bag .  There wasn't much; some clothes and hair gel. There was also a creased photograph of him as an eight-year-old on the day of his First Holy Communion, smiling broadly, his hands clasped together. ""He kept that photo with him through everything,"" says Sandra Lamb, his aunt. ""Through all the hostels and places he stayed in over the years he kept that dear to him."" Danny's childhood in the care system was scarred by neglect, illtreatment and missed opportunities by State services to intervene. Teachers at his school were so concerned about Danny's state that they wrote to social services. They worried about his home and how he had ""a knowledge of sexual activity way beyond his years"".  By the time he was taken into care he was deeply troubled and on a downward spiral into drugs, homelessness and crime. His life slipped quietly away at 19 years of age, from a drug overdose, in much the same way that he slipped through the cracks of a chaotic and largely dysfunctional child-protection service.  Of course we care about vulnerable children in the care system nowadays. Many front-line social workers do heroic work each day. We spend millions on care services. We now have a dedicated agency to tackle deficiencies in the sector. But we don't care enough. Ireland can afford a reasonable system of care for vulnerable children. It chooses not to pursue this for a simple reason: the lives of troubled children, usually from chaotic families in deprived communities, are not a priority in any public policy. Tusla, the child and family agency, was supposed to put children to the fore of State services. From the outset it has been starved of funding and political will. It limps along with enough resources to function but nowhere near enough to shift the agency's focus away from firefighting and towards the resource-intensive, preventive work so urgently required. A new State inquiry is about to be launched into the treatment of ""Grace"", who suffered within a care system that was meant to protect her. But we don't have to wait for the findings. We already know how the child-protection system is failing some of the most vulnerable young people. A lack of early intervention. Too much focus on emergency cases. Poor co-operation between State agencies. A system responding too late to neglect and welfare concerns. A front-line service struggling to deal with the volume of referrals. These issues may sound familiar. That's because they feature in the recommendations of almost 30 inquiries into the State's handling of child-abuse cases over the past two decades. They are in the recommendations of the Kilkenny incest case, the Kelly Fitzgerald case in Co Mayo, the McColgan case in Co Sligo, and case reviews into the deaths of children such as Tracey Fay and Danny Talbot. So why hasn't there been systemic change? Much of it is down to a lack of accountability. Accountability is not a simple demand that heads must roll: it comes through a system and culture in which someone is in charge and takes responsibility. There is no record of senior officials being dismissed or reprimanded in connection with any of these scandals. In the world of Irish public services nobody seems responsible for anything. Nobody learns, and the patterns repeat. Natasha and Minahil Natasha and Minahil don't need reminding that their lives are very different from those of Irish children .  The 14-year-olds spent much of their childhoods in a mobile-home park behind a security barrier on the edge of Athlone, in Co Westmeath.  They are among the 1,600 or more children who have grown up in a direct-provision system for asylum seekers. This form of communal accommodation has been consistently criticised for the long time people spend there, for overcrowding and for the inappropriate environment. ""You don't have the normal life of a child,"" Natasha says . ""When I look back on my life I'm going to know that I didn't do the things I wanted to do because I'm stuck here . . . It's like being stuck in a cage."" After more than five years in the system Natasha has secured permanent residency. Minahil recently secured her status after about nine years. They are both settled now and preparing for their Junior Certificates outside the direct-provision system but feel strongly that it needs to change ""It makes our parents think they're low and that it's their fault we live like this,"" Minahil says. ""I don't want them to feel like that. I think they do more than any parent could. They deserve a Nobel Prize.""  Intertwined with a systematic lack of accountability are skewed values that underpin public policies. The experiences of hundreds of young people in the direct-provision system have been documented in recent years by the United Nations and other organisations.  They paint a troubling picture of damage done to children by years of living in institutional accommodation, far from the atmosphere of a family home. Family poverty only adds to children's exclusion from society.  Yet the State has repeatedly failed to improve conditions, despite overwhelming evidence that it is storing up problems for the future. So, if the system is toxic, dysfunctional and damaging, why has it been tolerated for so long by successive governments?  A clue lies in Government briefing papers that concede that, although the system is ""not ideal"", improvements might raise the risk of asylum seekers in the UK moving here to avail of better conditions. ""Leaving aside the considerable difficulty in putting in place alternative reception conditions for those asylum seekers already here . . . the biggest concern would be the 'pull factor' involved,"" the papers say. In essence the system does not want asylum seekers. There is no mention of its international human-rights obligations or values. Instead it has established a system to keep the problem at bay. We are finally, after a decade of promises, introducing a single application procedure, aimed at speeding up claim processing. It should mean that fewer lives get stuck in long-term limbo. Yet we are still waiting for wider reforms that would create a more humane and civilised setting for some of the world's most vulnerable. Megan Halvey-Ryan  Megan Halvey-Ryan has scoliosis,an abnormal curvature of the spine. It has grown so acute that the 13-year-old finds it difficult to attend school.  ""Megan is not great,"" her mother says. ""She's very upset, and she is finding it hard to breathe and sleep."" Ideally, children with scoliosis should be operated on between three and six months. After that the condition can deteriorate, making surgery more complex and potentially resulting in lifelong difficulties. Waiting lists for surgery are between 15 to 18 months, according to the HSE. Two years ago Megan had a 20-degree curve.Now it has extended into a protruding S-shape.  She became the moving face of a recent RTÉ documentary chronicling the stories of those stuck on hospital waiting lists. She was told by the HSE, before a recent Late Late Show appearance, that her surgery was finally due for this week. But it has been delayed yet again.   In Ireland, consistent child poverty almost doubled during the economic downturn, due in part to a series of regressive budgets. It means that the crisis had a disproportionate impact on low-income and vulnerable groups without access to private care. It means that more and more low-income parents rely on a creaking public service to meet their children's basic health needs, exacerbating inequalities in health and life expectancy. Evidence increasingly shows, to a frightening degree, how people's postal codes and financial circumstances affect their health: children living in deprived areas, for example, with an unskilled parent are far more likely to die earlier than those born to professionals in affluent areas, according to the Institute of Public Health. Although there is plenty of rhetoric from political leaders around protecting the most vulnerable, it often isn't matched in reality.  One argument is that the recession meant we had little choice but to make hard spending decisions. Many other European Union countries also had to cut spending. How did they manage in terms of social justice, and how does Ireland compare?  We can answer this question because the German-based Bertelsmann Foundation publishes an annual index of social injustice in the EU, using a broad set of objective measures. Ireland came out badly in its most recent report, last year. Most member states managed to get through the past seven or eight years without making social injustice very much worse than it was. Ireland, by contrast, was one of the worst performers. Social justice simply wasn't on the agenda.  Sandra Hanley-Hand  The most degrading part, Sandra Hanley-Hand  says, was having to use the side entrance of the hotel with her children. ""You weren't allowed to walk in the main door,"" she says.  She and her husband, Brendan, were homeless for 11 months after the house they rented was repossessed. They were rehoused in a series of hotels or hostel-style accommodation, along with their two children, Jasmine and Ryan. Keeping them in the same school meant catching up to eight buses a day. Added to the uncertainty of moving from place to place was the chaos of living out of a suitcase in confined conditions. ""My husband and my two kids . . . we have to eat, sleep and wash, all in the one room,"" she told RTÉlast year. ""It kills us, because we feel that we put our children into this situation."" The number of homeless adults and children has reached a new high. About 2,400 children were in emergency accommodation at the end of January, stripped of the freedom, dignity and security that every child needs and deserves. What this mean for a child is living in a single room with their parents, with nowhere to cook and eat, no room to play indoors, and no safe place to go outside. Although a belated political focus on the problem is helping families and others move out of homelessness, the system is struggling to keep up with the volume of new homeless people. There was a time in the early part of the last century when child homelessness was blamed on its being a ""legacy of alien rule"". The disgrace, now, is all ours.  If a lack of accountability and skewed values are underlying issues, then misplaced priorities are another. We are told that a series of obstacles, such as a dysfunctional housing market, is preventing quick solutions. Yet in the 1940s and 1950s, when the country was on its knees, tens of thousands of social-housing units were built.  The failure to ensure that Nama was given an explicit social remit means it sank down the priority list during the downturn. So it is only now that thousands of homes have been promised over the coming years, long after the scale of new homelessness began to emerge. Seán McDonald John McDonald i s haunted by his son Seán's lost opportunities. Had he been able to afford speech therapy and other interventions, he believes, his son, who has autism, might be able to communicate better. ""It kills you,"" he says. ""There were missed opportunities over the space of five years to maximise his potential. It hurts to say it, but financially I wasn't in a position to offer him speech and language therapy. I feel like I'll live with it forever."" McDonald struggled to get access to these services through the public system when his son was diagnosed. Forced to rely on HSE services, he says, he hit a brick wall of bureaucracy and excuses. After threatening legal action he did eventually get access to therapy, but McDonald says it was sporadic and nowhere near enough. Seán is now 14 and attends a special school. His father's big worry is where his son will go when he turns 18. No service is available, he says. ""I know there are people in worse situations. But our focus is on providing for him. It's just frustrating when you try to get a service . . . All you get is a bureaucracy saying no.""  Experts agree that early intervention is crucial. For children with autism especially, the right kind of support at the right time can help unlock some of the most restricting aspects of the condition. All children with a suspected disability are legally entitled to have their needs assessed within six months. Once any needs are identified the services should follow. But in many parts of the country these services appear to be in crisis. Thousands wait years for interventions such as speech and language therapy. That is just half the story. Although legislation provides for an assessment, there is no guarantee of services. No one is compelled to do anything. The only thing a Minister must do is ""have regard to available resources"". The result is a queue for basic services and an underfunded system that's unable to meet children's needs.  The irony is that disability legislation passed a decade ago was supposed to replace charity with rights. Yet parents are still battling to secure the most basic services for their children. Successive reports and inquiries have highlighted a careless waste of young people's potential. There has been wringing of hands by the State, and hollow apologies, followed by the dead hand of change. Whistleblowers who tried to shine a light on injustice often had to endure bullying or intimidation. It is a mindset not a million miles away from that which surrounded the unaccountable and authoritarian mother-and-baby homes, industrial schools and Magdalene laundries. It should instil rage or despair, just as the Tuam scandal has, but neither response is much use to vulnerable children. The challenge is to face up to what these children's stories tell us about the State and to build a society that puts the needs of its most vulnerable young people at its heart.

488,The Irish Times,19/06/2018,"ESRI rejects bubble fears and expects house prices to keep rising; 'Cheaper' houses have now rebounded, putting burden on lower income groups","The Economic and Social Research Institute  has played down fears of a bubble in housing prices by arguing that the strong growth in prices was supported by fundamentals ""at this point in time"".  In its latest quarterly economic commentary, the think tank expects house prices to continue to rise, due to supply remaining below ""structural demand"".  While new mortgage lending is ""rapidly increasing"" - rising by 13.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year - the ESRI said it is not yet ""unsustainable"".  However, it warned that ""careful monitoring is required"" with house prices expected to continue to increase, and rising average loan sizes.  ""This reinforces the importance of having [Central Bank] macroprudential limits in place,"" Conor O'Toole said. Research from the ESRI also indicates that house price increases are more significant at the lower end of the market. Having fallen by most in the bust, ""cheaper"" houses have now rebounded much more rapidly, suggesting a further burden on affordability for lower income groups.  The ESRI is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 4.7 per cent in 2018, down slightly on its first-quarter forecast of 4.8 per cent for the year, followed by 3.9 per cent growth in 2019, while its latest forecasts suggest that the decline in unemployment will stall slightly.  Earlier this year, the ESRI indicated that unemployment would fall to 5.4 per cent in 2018, but it has since revised it back to 5.6 per cent, while it has pulled back a level of 4.5 per cent for next year, to 5 per cent. 'Real' activity Consumption will increase by 2.4 per cent in 2018, and by 2.5 per cent in 2019, it said. These forecasts are based on the assumption that a European Economic Area-type of agreement will be established between the UK and the EU.  The ESRI also reiterated its call for a parallel set of accounts on the Irish economy, which would split data out into ""real"" activity undertaken by multinationals here, and ""distortionary"" activity, such as relocating intellectual property. In addition, the ESRI considered whether the economic return for the Government would be greater by going ahead with its National Development Plan (NDP), or by cutting income taxes, with both incurring a similar cost. ""Both scenarios do result in increased economic activity, but there are variations,"" said Kieran McQuinn, research professor at the ESRI. While going ahead with the NDP would see increased potential output over the long run, cutting taxes would produce a larger increase in disposable income consumption. However, on balance, the ESRI argues that a ""well-targeted plan"" could result in a more positive impact, thus limiting scope for tax cuts, with Mr McQuinn noting he would be ""wary of stimulating the economy"" through any cuts in the personal tax rate.  Income taxes ""The results suggest that, given the Government's commitment to the National Development Plan in the medium-term, there is little or no scope for cutting the overall tax burden which would stimulate the economy further."" Not only that, but Mr McQuinn said that as income taxes were not having ""a restrictive impact on the labour market"", there was ""no reason"" for income tax cuts.If the Government does want to go ahead and cut taxes in October's budget, such as decreasing the level of income at which people start paying the higher rate of tax, Mr McQuinn said that it should be done on a ""neutral basis"", and offset by increasing taxes elsewhere. On external risks, the commentary highlighted uncertainties at a European level, whether through Brexit or in other member states such as Italy.  ""Furthermore, any reduction in global economic activity, such as through a reduction in trade openness, would have a material impact on the domestic economy,"" the ESRI said. The Government will publish its summer economic statement on Tuesday, and is expected to assert that ""excess"" corporation tax paid in Ireland by multinationals should be allocated to the ""rainy day fund"". Mr McQuinn said the fund was a ""good idea, there's a lot to be said for it"" and that the Government had the balance ""broadly right"", in terms of whether it should pay down debt, invest or set money aside.",1,monetary,,,,,EU
458,The Irish Times,27/04/2016,"Economy faces major external threats, says department; Ministers tell FG backbenchers deal with FF only prospect of saving Irish Water"," The next government faces a greater level of global economic uncertainty than at any time since the height of the financial crisis, the Department of Finance has warned. Amid divisions between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil over Irish Water, the department has called for prudent fiscal management to offset any threats to the recovery from the numerous sources of international uncertainty.  The warning, in a submission to be sent to the European Commission under EU rules, came as the department upgraded its growth forecast for 2016 and said the economy would continue to expand rapidly in 2017. The Stability Programme Update document forecasts 4.9 per cent growth in gross domestic product this year, up 0.5 percentage points on its last projection, and it believes growth of 3.9 per cent is in prospect for 2017. At the same time, the department said income tax and VAT collections in the first three months of the year were ""somewhat disappointing"".  Edging closer  Last night, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil appeared to be edging closer to a deal on water charges which would pave the way for a Fine Gael-led minority government.  Talks between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael broke up at 10pm with final agreement not expected before Dáil statements on the water issue today. Sources last night suggested the water deal will centre on the suspension of charges for a period.  The emerging deal will see a commission of experts established to examine issues such as alternative charging systems. Irish Water, as an entity, will not be referred to the commission. The work of the commission could take a year, it is thought.  The outcome of the commission would then be referred to an Oireachtas committee. The committee's findings would be voted on by the Dáil, as had been proposed by Fianna Fáil, meaning the future of charges will have to decided on the floor of the House. While initially hostile to a compromise that involved a lengthy suspension of charges, Fine Gael backbenchers yesterday softened their positions as many realised a failure to reach a deal would cause an election. Acting Taoiseach Enda Kenny and senior Fine Gael ministers earlier informed backbenchers the only prospect of saving Irish Water is to reach a compromise with Fianna Fáil on the charging regime. Mr Kenny told the outgoing Fine Gael-Labour Cabinet that their meeting yesterday was their last, and thanked the Ministers for their work. While Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin told the Dáil he is not afraid to go to the country over water, senior figures in his party last night said a deal will be done within 48 hours.  Downside risks  In the stability document, the department said the ""principal downside risks in the short term"" relate to trading partner growth and Britain's looming referendum on EU membership.  The report, endorsed yesterday by the Cabinet, is to be debated today in the Dáil before its submission to the European Commission later this week.  While the department also cited spending pressures, it expected such trends could be accommodated within European fiscal rules.  The projection of continued growth in Ireland remains the ""central scenario"".  However, the department warned that financial market turmoil at the start of the year flowed from concern that weakness in China and emerging markets could push the global economy towards recession.

1195,Irish Independent,12/08/2021,Stash economy - Ireland's shift from nation of debtors to join Europe's top savers,"FORGET frugal Schwabian housewives and bond-buying Belgian dentists, Europe's new supersavers are the Irish who stashed away almost a fifth of disposable income last year. That's a full six percentage points more than the average for the eurozone and compares with 16pc for the traditionally hard-saving Germans, according to figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The surge in savings in part reflects the harshest lockdown curbs in Europe which meant you could not find anywhere open to spend your cash. Still, it is quite a turnaround for consumers who had racked up (EURO)200bn in debt by 2008 in a frenzy of property speculation - equivalent to twice earnings - that took the country to the verge of economic collapse. Now, consumer debt stands at (EURO)86.4bn. Those savings should be making their way into consumer spending by now and as the remaining lockdown restrictions ease and paving the way for a domestic economic rebound to complement the strong exports that have kept economic growth bubbling along. The question is, how much of the (EURO)132bn that has been salted away - of which (EURO)15bn is estimated to be forced lockdown saving - will be spent. We may not be saving as much as we were in April when (EURO)2bn was stashed on deposit - but we are still saving and the latest Central Bank of Ireland figures show that (EURO)453m was added in June, a lot less than in the same month of last year, and below the (EURO)600m added each month in the 12 months before the pandemic hit. The trend towards higher levels of savings has been going on for about a decade now, but it got a real boost from the lockdowns. In 2018 and 2019, gross household savings averaged around (EURO)3.5bn per quarter, according to the Central Bank of Ireland. New sales figures however, drink to make lost days confirm what we can all see: people are out and about now on main streets, although the queues outside Penneys and other stores that greeted the initial reopening have naturally disappeared. Those lockdown homecooked dinners are also being replaced by meals out with long-lost friends and spending in bars quintupled in July from June, doubtless helped along by the thermostat hitting 30 degrees which made for a positively Mediterranean experience for outside dining. Encouragingly, total card spending in June was (EURO)7.3bn, which was more than the (EURO)6bn seen in June 2019, before the pandemic hit. Vat revenues were also buoyant and in July (EURO)2.5bn was collected, again better than the (EURO)2.3bn in same month in 'normal' 2019. The question is, will spending trend higher and savings get drawn down? Some estimates say the potential extra spending from unlocking those bank accounts is equal to half the forced savings. The Department of Finance is taking a conservative view with its forecast that domestic demand in the economy will rise by 2.5pc this year. It notes in the Summer Economic Statement that the savings are so large ""that even minor deviations from the assumed path could move the dial on the overall growth path'. You can understand the caution. The biggest immediate threat to that rosy outlook is the Delta variant and continued infections - if you are worried, you will keep on saving, or at the very least not run down the money you have, just in case you lose your job. The second issue is that the sectors of the economy that have been slowest to reopen are those where lost consumption simply cannot be made up. When publican Tom Mulligan welcomed the first customers inside The Cobblestone in Smithfield for the first time in almost 500 days at the end of July, he had been running a small outdoor area for six weeks although he said he wouldn't think ""we've made any money"". Wealthy savings to rather thanNo one is going drink enough pints now to make up for those lost 500 days. The same applies to hairdressers - you won't have twice as many cuts as you did in pre-pandemic days - and to holidays. The other potential risk to the sunny forecasts of consumers flashing their excess cash is the type of people who have been able to save money in a country where around a million were at one stage out of a job and on benefits. A review by the European Central Bank across the eurozone, the UK and US showed the increase in savings was concentrated among high-income households and older people while lower and middle-income households saved less or even dipped into their savings. Research from Central Bank of Ireland economists Reamonn Lydon and Tara McIndoe-Calder estimates that more than half the savings here could be by the top 30pc of households by income. The people who did save have been sitting on that money for over a year now - and will likely treat it as 'wealth', which tends to be invested, rather than spent. That distinction is important, because economists estimate that spending from wealth may only amount to 5pc of total saved compared with up to 50pc from what people see an income. An initial surge in orders of durable goods - things like TVs, washing machines and computers - has already tailed off in the US after an initial rebound in demand that was more than double the pace of recoveries in economic previous cycles, according to consultants TS Lombard, an economic consultancy. ""As uncertainty abates, households would want to rebalance their portfolios to add more non-liquid financial and non-financial assets rather than spend all their savings currently held in the safer instruments,"" argues TS Lombard economist Shweta Singh. On that basis, we can expect ever higher house prices and frothier stock markets rather than a massive filip for the main www.street.No one can drink enough pints to make up for 500 lost days Wealthy will shift savings to investment rather than spend Irish among savings giants with post-pandemic hoard Graphic   Cash pile: The glut of pandemic savings may be spent on investments rather than in our shops",1,disaster,financial crisis,,,,ireland
1141,The Irish Times,15/06/2009,Rotating taoiseach not in Labour plan,"LABOUR HAS no plans to raise the issue of a revolving taoiseach during the next election campaign, party leader Eamon Gilmore said yesterday. He told reporters he had never suggested that a revolving taoiseach would be a condition for Labour entering government after the next election.  It is not about offices or revolving anything. It is about offering the people of the country an alternative choice. The people want to take this country back from a cabal of bankers and developers, said Mr Gilmore. He said that the sooner the next election could be held the better as it was obvious that Fianna Fáil and the six Green Party TDs were intent on holding on to power for as long as possible.  At this stage it is a matter of clinging on to office because they have lost the confidence of the people, said Mr Gilmore. He was speaking in advance of a rally in Dublin s Temple Bar to celebrate Labour s performance in the local and European elections. At the rally Mr Gilmore said that June 5th had been a remarkable day in the history of the Labour Party with the election of three MEPs, 132 city and county councillors and 84 town councillors. The results of June 5th show again that seats are not won in the last three weeks of the campaign.  These seats were won by the enormous effort put in by candidates and their supporters over the past year, the doors canvassed in dark winter nights, the leaflets given out in shopping centres on Saturday mornings during spring, the many meetings attended.  In the same way the next general election will not be won or lost in the period between the dissolution of the Dáil and polling day. That is why, for us, the general election campaign must begin today, he said. The Labour leader added that every single voter in the country had to be given the opportunity to vote for change in the next election not just a change of faces but a change of policy and direction.  The economic disaster that Fianna Fáil has created has sapped national morale and left a dark cloud of uncertainty over the country. People who have lost their jobs wonder if they will ever work again. Those in jobs are fearful of being made redundant. Families are fearful of losing their homes. Parents worry about the future of their children, he said. Mr Gilmore added that the Labour Party would continue to call the Government to account but also continue to produce positive policy proposals that offered an alternative approach.  Throughout the economic crisis and particularly throughout the recent election campaign we put jobs and the real economy at the forefront of political debate. We will continue to spell out the steps that must be taken to restore confidence in our people.  We can and will recover from this recession. But recovery will be delayed as long as this demoralised and discredited Government clings to office.  The sooner we have a change of government with a fresh mandate to implement Labour Party policies the sooner we can put their country on the road to recovery, said Mr Gilmore.",1,political,employment,,,,ireland
949,The Irish Times,25/02/2017,"NEW POLITICS, ONE YEAR ON; It was the election that nobody won. It produced a Government that struggles to govern. A new series assesses minority government and Ireland's changing political landscape","A year ago tomorrow Ireland went to the polls for a general election that would provide the greatest upheaval in Irish politics since . . . well, since the previous election. Irish politics has arguably undergone more change in the past decade than in the previous eight. But the previous earthquake election, in 2011, had replaced a decimated Fianna Fáil with the traditional alternative of Fine Gael and Labour.  Twelve months ago voters rejected that combination decisively, tearing up the old political playbook and opening a new era in politics and government.  It was the election that nobody won. The result was a Dáil unlike any that went before and, eventually, a Government unlike any we have seen before.  The votes were hardly counted before pundits were hailing the advent of ""new politics"". But it soon became clear that that ""new politics"" had a highly elastic definition. It meant whatever you wanted it to mean.  David Begg, writing in The Irish Times a week after the general election, and citing the hit television series Borgen, suggested that it could mean a more ""Danish"" style of politics. Whatever you think of the past year, it hasn't felt very Danish. But what has it meant? What has the new politics done? What has it changed, and what has remained the same? And, crucially, has it led to better government? These and related themes will be explored by Irish Times writers in a major series over the course of the next week. Shocked faces  The shocked faces of the Taoiseach and his Fine Gael ministers at count centres around the country on February 27th, 2016, were evidence at least that the party had believed in the justice of its cause.  Even though the polls were unconvincing at best, Fine Gael ministers and election strategists believed that the strength of the economic recovery would guarantee them a return to power. The remarkable turnaround in the State's economic fortunes since the nadir of the 2010 bailout were testified to by a range of economic statistics: the fastest recovery in employment, the strongest growth in the European Union, the rise in property prices, the strengthening of consumer and business confidence.  But the experience of many communities and individuals on the ground, especially in Fine Gael's rural heartlands, was that the recovery was something on the news, not in their lives. They came, many of them, not just to dismiss the ""Keep the Recovery Going"" slogan but to actively resent it. For Labour the result was perhaps more predictable but also more severe. The party had known it was in a battle for survival, but the result - a reduction to just seven TDs, from the 36 elected in 2011 - was at the darker end of its direst imaginings. The 2016 election result removed the Labour Party as a central player in Irish politics. Bringing the party back from the periphery has been the work of its new leader, Brendan Howlin. At best that remains a work in progress. Defenestrated  But if the voters had defenestrated the coalition it was much less clear what they wanted to put in its place. Three of the four main parties - Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Féin - were either disappointed or bitterly disappointed with the result. The fourth, Fianna Fáil, was happier, but more sober heads realised that the party was only returned to half its traditional size. The former Fianna Fáil minister Conor Lenihan boasted ""We're baaaack!"" They were only half back.  The shock that had been administered to the political system as a whole, allied to the uncertainty provided by the new Dáil arithmetic, meant that when the 32nd Dáil met on March 10th, 2016, nobody knew what it was going to do. It didn't know itself. Enda Kenny, reeling from the loss of a third of his TDs, also knew that his position as leader of the largest party and sitting Taoiseach put him in a strong position to lead the next Government. But Kenny also knew that the first faculty any politician needs is the ability to count - and when he counted, the reality of his situation was clear to him. A grand coalition?  On April 6th, 2016, Kenny signalled the first departure of the new politics: he offered to share power with Fianna Fáil in a grand coalition - a ""full partnership government"", he said. The offer was historic and unprecedented, a measure of how much the election result had changed politics. But it was also made in the knowledge that it would probably be rejected.  During the campaign Micheál Martin, the Fianna Fáil leader, had consistently ruled out a coalition with Fine Gael. He felt that it would hand leadership of the opposition to Sinn Féin and that Fianna Fáil would suffer from being the smaller party in a Fine Gael-led coalition. More importantly, his party was resolutely against it.  Martin rejected the grand-coalition offer. But he said he would facilitate a Fine Gael minority Government if Kenny could secure the eight Independent votes that would give him a Dáil majority with a Fianna Fáil abstention. Seeing a lifeline, Kenny seized his chance. When the Lord closes the door He opens a little window.  The new politics  Martin's conditional offer, more than anything else, contained the blueprint for the architecture of the new politics.  Discussions with the Independents, previously meandering, got serious, and transactional. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan lumbered into the room carrying the authority of his experience and the financial clout of his department. The Independents had a wish list of local and national projects and causes they wanted to feature as priorities of the new Government. I am the Minister for Finance, Noonan told them. I will write the budget. I can make sure you get these things.  The Independents knew they might never hear another offer like this one. They signed on the dotted line. New politics might have changed some things. But it certainly hadn't changed everything.  On May 6th, 70 days after the general election, Enda Kenny was re-elected Taoiseach by the Dáil. Hopelessly unprepared  The long uncertainty of spring was followed by the shaky start of summer. The administration seemed hopelessly unprepared for taking office; indeed, the programme for government was not even printed as the Taoiseach's nomination was being voted on.  Within weeks the Government suffered a near-breakdown over abortion, when Independent Ministers refused to agree a Government position on a Dáil motion on abortion. The Attorney General had advised that the Bill was unconstitutional, but the Independents dug in, seeking a ""vote of conscience"". That this sought to set aside the constitutional principle of collective responsibility bothered Kenny but not the Independents. Kenny acceded to their demands.  Independent Ministers have often served in government as powerful advocates for their pet causes and issues: Beaumont Hospital, disabilities, judicial and State-board appointments, Waterford cardiology services and so on. They have had rather more difficulty adapting to their role as Ministers of a collective-Cabinet Government.  Fine Gael's exasperation with the Independents fluctuates by the week, with many Ministers privately believing that the Independents - Shane Ross in particular - are unsuited to or uninterested in operating as a cohesive Government. Some of this is just politics, but it's a fact that the arrangements of the new politics have undermined the cabinet system of government.  A slow, cumbersome Dá il Within three weeks of taking office  the Government was defeated on a Private Members' vote in the Dáil, an event that was invested with some significance at the time. But nervous Ministers would have to get used to it. It soon became clear that the Government would be losing votes on a regular basis; last week it lost four on one day.  This was the essence of the new politics: the simple fact that the Government of the day does not command a majority in parliament. And the coalition was not just a few votes off a Dáil majority: it was 20 votes away from it. It wasn't just that the Government would lose Private Members' votes. It also lost the ability to manage the business of the house. A business committee, made up of representatives of all the Dáil groupings, now agrees the order of business by consensus. The result is a Dáil whose procedures are slow and cumbersome. The process of legislating has slowed to a trickle.  An analysis by my Irish Times colleague Noel Whelan last month revealed that the present Dáil has passed just 18 Bills, most of which were technical or procedural. In fact, Whelan argued that apart from budgetary legislation the only substantial piece of its own legislation that the Government has passed through the Oireachtas since taking office is Simon Coveney's housing Bill, passed before Christmas after an arm wrestle with Fianna Fáil. That is not just careful legislating; it is a slow-motion parliament. New politics has inverted the power relationship between parliament and executive. Where previously the Government ruled the Oireachtas, now it needs the consent of the Dáil.  The Dáil has not risen to that challenge. Many TDs remain resolutely locally focused; of those who aren't it would be hard to say that the new structures have elevated the pursuit of the national interest in their working week.  The power of the Opposition has largely been used to slow the work of government. Privately, many senior civil servants believe that the experiment of a minority government has been an abject failure; some even say that they are reluctant to propose legislation because they are afraid that the Dáil will amend it beyond recognition. Spending money to solve problems  But the work of government is more than just legislating. Government also runs the country from day to day. The record is mixed: official and Government response to Brexit has been much criticised, but it has been thorough and industrious, if sometimes light on the political front.  The Government agreed a budget, and stuck by it, even if its passage was greased by the discovery of several hundred million euro in Noonan's bottom drawer, a budgetary inflation that drew criticism from the Fiscal Advisory Council, the independent budgetary watchdog. It confirmed a pattern of spending money to solve problems.  If this is a failing of government it is one that is cheered on by the Dáil; every week there are motions and statements demanding that more public funds be spent on a variety of causes, from big ones such as the health service to the small ones that litter oral questions and topical-issues debates.  In that respect the new politics is exactly like the old politics. Everyone has plenty of ideas to spend more money, and commitment to maintain budgetary discipline remains the preserve of the Government and, usually but not always, of the Fianna Fáil TDs who support it.  There is no sign of the Independent Budgetary Office that would cost the proposals of the Opposition as well as the Government. That would change the terms of a lot of Dáil debate, but, like many of the hopes for the new politics a year ago, it remains a plan rather than a reality. More than anyone else the architect of the new-politics arrangements was Micheál Martin, and, a year on, his party has reason enough to be satisfied with its progress. The party is polling strongly and is favourite to lead the next government. Sinn Féin, which hoped to lead the Opposition, has been confined to a secondary role and is one of the chief critics of the new politics. As Gerry Adams, honest but hardly eloquent, expostulated in the Dáil before Christmas: ""New politics, my arse!"" The Independents outside the Government have the opposite view of the Independents inside politics, while Labour's struggles make the new arrangements irrelevant to it.  And Fine Gael? The new politics has returned it to power, but throughout the party there is growing frustration with the arrangement. That the party is in the process of changing leader is not exactly an endorsement of the situation he led them into.  And all of the participants now wonder if the new system will survive his departure. 'Borgen' it ain't  Political scientists say that Ireland has always fallen somewhere between the two classic models of democracy: the majoritarian (Westminster) model and the consensus model, which typically features a multiparty landscape (rather than a two-party model), coalition governments and a balance between government and parliament.  Last year, writing in How Ireland Voted, an academic assessment of the election and its consequences, two of Ireland's best-known political scientists, David Farrell and Jane Suiter, speculated that one of the outcomes of the election was that Ireland was moving definitively away from the Westminster model towards the consensus model. To a more Danish system, if you like. Twelve months on and Borgen it ain't. The new politics has given us a new type of government, a more equal relationship between the Dáil and the Cabinet. But it's hard to argue that it has given us demonstrably better government.  Different? Yes. Better? Hardly. nThe New Politics series continues next week with . . .  nFiach Kelly: Has the recovery come to rural Ireland?   nHarry McGee: Politics have changed  yet stayed the same   nSarah Bardon: TDs on a strange year in Leinster House  nPlus podcasts and more on irishtimes.com/politics",1,political,employment,,,,ireland
489,The Irish Times,03/10/2002,ESRI says 'minimalist' budget would be prudent,"The Government should take advantage of lower public expectations on tax cuts and spending growth by delivering a neutral budget in December, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). The advice from the think-tank is based on a picture of rapidly deteriorating public finances, which the Minister for Finance, Mr McCreevy, has admitted will force him into deficit this year. ""Budget 2003 may be the first budget in nearly a decade when there will be diminished public expectation of reductions in taxation and substantial increases in public expenditure,"" the ESRI says in its Budget Perspectives 2003, published yesterday. The think-tank argues that the ""prudent"" approach in light of general economic uncertainty would be to adopt a ""minimalist"" budget for next year. 02100300109 ""Nobody is looking for tax cuts,"" said Mr Danny McCoy of the ESRI, who is pushing for an indexing of tax and expenditure to prices and wages so that the Budget makes no changes ""in real terms"". The ESRI has estimated that full indexation could be achieved at a cost of E1 billion. Mr McCoy says the Government's budgetary stance should remain neutral until a number of one-off influences can work their way out of the system. Among these are funds from the sale of ACC Bank, one-off contributions from the Central Bank, a reduction in EU budgetary contributions and revenue from third-generation mobile phone licences. ""The deterioration in the public finances will only become apparent in the Exchequer balance next year when these funds are unavailable to meet tax and expenditure commitments,"" the ESRI advises. Other skewing factors include tax and budgetary alterations such as the move to a calendar tax year and a move to a system of tax credits. Until such factors can be eliminated, it will be ""difficult to decipher the underlying relationship between economic activity and tax revenue"", according to the ESRI publication. ""If you don't know what's going on, then it's a bit heroic to start meddling,"" said Mr McCoy. The ESRI is forecasting an Exchequer deficit of E3.1 billion for next year, and a deficit in the general Government balance of almost E800 million. The general Government balance, a measure favoured by international economists, includes the finances of all arms of Government. A key contributor to next year's budgetary outlook will be payments made under the Government-sponsored Special Savings Incentive Scheme, which is expected to cost E500 million in any full year. More significant however, according to the ESRI, will be the implementation of benchmarking recommendations. It argues that if benchmarking is implemented fully from next year onwards, it is likely to add another E700 million to next year's projected deficit. This impact could be even more severe, according to the ESRI, if public-sector pensions and social-welfare payments are indexed to public sector pay. Mr McCoy admitted that the ESRI's advice was based on a presumption that ""everything will work"" in areas such as spending and tax revenue. Significant risks could come, he said, from below-trend economic growth and an absence of recovery in tax revenues. Tax revenue growth is currently expected to be 7.5 per cent next year, but on the basis of Department of Finance projections of a E1.5 billion tax shortfall for 2002, such forecasts look uncertain. Additional risks could be provided by persistently high public spending, which is currently running at 20 per cent. Mr McCreevy has committed to reducing this growth to 14.3 per cent by the end of the year. Mr McCoy said that Mr McCreevy's ""strong will"" had seen him meet high targets in the past and there was little reason to believe that the same result could not be achieved this time. He added, however, that cuts should not be made in respect of the National Development Plan, which he says amounts to ""necessary public investment"".",1,fiscal,elections,,,,ireland
1008,Irish Independent,02/04/2013,Optimism rising as SMEs see light at end of tunnel; ISME finds confidence has reached a 'net positive for first time in two years',"THE small business sector is at last moving in the right direction, with three quarters of key business trends now positive, according to a new survey. The report from small business group ISME found sentiment among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) was on the up across a number of areas such as business confidence, market expectations and employment plans. The ISME report asked business owners to give their opinion on 13 aspects of running a small business in this country. In 10 of the 13 key indicators, businesses reported things were improving. Business confidence was now a net positive for the SME sector for the first time in at least two years. A majority of companies now expect to increase employment in the near future - something that has been unheard of since the recession took hold. But concerns remain about current and future exports. And expectations, while still in positive territory, have declined sharply in the last quarter. Market sentiment around current exports fell from 41pc to 22pc, while expectations around future exports dropped from 53pc to 45pc. Revive Despite the improvements, ISME chief executive Mark Fielding claimed the Government was still not doing enough. ""Now that business confidence is increasing, it is incumbent on Government to put in place the appropriate environment in which business can revive and plan for a positive future. The SME private sector must also ensure that wage rates are held for the foreseeable future, through a pay freeze for at least one year, to bring our wages more in line with our competitors"". ""The biggest concern for all SME sectors, as mentioned in the survey is economic uncertainty, demonstrating to Government that the domestic economy must be protected through a real jobs plan and a concerted effort to bring the state sector into line on costs. ""The wealth generating private sector cannot continue to pay through the nose for the costly state sector and Croke Park 2 must bring greater and faster cost reductions,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Small Firms Association (SFA) has called on the Government to stop imposing what it sees as unnecessary costs on small business and allow the sector to grow. ""Government measures taken since 2010 have already added over (EURO)660m per annum to labour costs, through employer PRSI changes, pensions levy and most recently the changes to the redundancy rebate,"" claimed acting director of the SFA Avine McNally. ""The cumulative impact of this has been a 1.4pc increase in labour costs, while at the same time both employers and staff in the vast majority of small companies have taken pay cuts. Some positive signs amid the gloom but credit is key and banks have to do more ANALYSIS NEWS that a host of key indicators for the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector are on the up is undoubtedly good for small firms. SMEs have been hit much harder than the wider market since the downturn, with companies that had been wholly focused on the domestic market being badly caught out by the speed of the collapse. Now, according to an ISME report, nine of 13 key indicators for the health of the sector - such as employment, business environment and investment - are showing positive figures for the first time in two years. There appears to be, if not green shoots, then certainly the prospect of some sort of stabilisation over the rest of the year. Concerns remain, however. Exports, which have saved many companies, seem poised to decline. Weakness in sterling makes Irish exports more expensive in what is still our biggest market, while the issues in the European economy are showing few signs of settling down. The bottom line is the SME sector is fragile in the extreme and while the bottom may have been reached, sustained growth is still some way off. So what needs to be done? The Small Firms Association is clear that the Government has saddled its members with unnecessary costs in the past two years, adding 1.4pc to labour costs, while ISME says the Government is not doing enough to stimulate the sector. The key, though, are the banks. Many SMEs are profitable businesses saddled with property debts from the boom. Lenders need to work with them to maintain jobs and come up with a plan to deal with those debts, while the banks also need to start lending more. It has been clear for some time that access to credit is still a problem for SMEs. Without that, firms will continue to wither.

1363,The Irish Times,03/11/2010,Turkeys and Christmas,"THE SURPRISE resignation of Independent Fianna Fáil TD James McDaid from the Dáil has added to the difficulties of the Coalition Government but it need not cause an immediate general election. At this time of considerable financial difficulty and economic uncertainty, the former minister s action amounts to an unnecessary distraction rather than to a full-blown political crisis. As a Government spokesman insisted: it still has a working majority in the Dáil. And while that majority has been eroded, it is not in imminent danger of collapse. Whether three of Dr McDaid s Independent Fianna Fáil colleagues, who surrendered the party whip on a variety of local issues, can be expected to support the Government on what is billed to be the most draconian budget in the history of this State is uncertain. What independent politician, including Michael Lowry, wants to stand four-square with that proposition in what now seems the immediate run-up to a general election? The four byelections that are now pending will not be held until the first quarter of 2011 and Fianna Fáil believes that it will take a drubbing. Nonetheless, if the political will exists in Cabinet, the design of a December budget will be extremely challenging, but possible to do. Dr McDaid is no stranger to controversy. Two years ago, he lost the party whip by abstaining on a Fine Gael cervical cancer motion. More recently, he threatened to vote against the coming budget unless Letterkenny hospital was protected from health cuts. That unrealistic demand may have induced his resignation. Before that, however, he called for a pre-budget general election and was critical of the Government s handling of the economic crisis. Dr McDaid may be sincere, but he plays to the gallery. On the one hand, his Dáil support was made contingent on Letterkenny hospital receiving special treatment; on the other, he complained the Government was incapable of taking tough decisions. His demand for an immediate general election was premised on the notion that, somehow, a strong Government with a majority of 20 or more seats would emerge to put things right. It was unclear whether Fianna Fáil would be involved. The time has passed now for a general election. The ham-fisted attempt to reach a consensus with the main Opposition parties on the four-year spending plan with detailed policy decisions failed. The Coalition Government is going it alone, albeit with the minimum of a public mandate and public support to do so. But, here we are. It would have been better, given the political situation, if there were a strong Government of whatever hue to bring forward such proposals. The argument that three or four weeks electioneering on a four-year economic plan before Christmas would discommode the public is a nonsense. The public has stopped spending in anticipation of a harsh budget and lower living standards. Money will not flow again until there is clarity about future taxation and income. For the Government s own survival, it would be wise if the time lag between the four-year plan and the Dáil vote on the budget were much closer.",1,political,exports,,,,ireland
296,Irish Independent,11/08/2014,Coalition's vote-getting exercise risks Ireland's economic recovery,"THE Government is playing a dangerous game right now. The fragile economic recovery is only getting off the ground after six brutal years and already the promises are starting to mount up. Hot on the heels of Minister for Finance Michael Noonan's hints about a gentler-than-expected budget (against the advice of the ESRI and the Fiscal Advisory Council), Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin has told the Irish Independent about his plans to reverse public sector pay and pension cuts. Preparing for the end of the ""financial emergency"" was Howlin's description. But what we're really talking about is preparing for the next general election. There is a determination in the coalition - and particularly in Labour - not to repeat the ""mistake"" of 1996/97. Back then Ruairi Quinn, as Finance Minister, adopted a very prudent budgetary approach. Too prudent in the eyes of cabinet colleagues, who felt he should have loosened the reins a little in advance of the 1997 general election, which the Rainbow Coalition narrowly lost. Labour got no thanks for doing the 'right thing' then. And, to the horror of party stalwarts, it ended up handing over a fast-growing economy to Fianna Fail, which went on to reap the political dividends. It would be another 14 years before it or Fine Gael would taste power again. Coalition figures would baulk at the notion they would do anything fiscally reckless. But there's no denying that political considerations will prevail over economic ones between now and the general election. That's understandable - it's what all political parties do - but it's also deeply worrying from an economic point of view and not without political risk for the coalition. End of the emergency? We're really preparing for the next General Election The economic concerns are obvious. There's no question the economy is improving. But, with the budget still in deficit, debt levels extremely high and a very uncertain international environment, we're far from economically secure. To lapse back into old-style promises, to cut taxes and increase wages risks undermining the recovery and suggests we've learned little. Politically, the government also runs the risks of creating expectations it cannot possibly realise. The growing economy and strong tax returns may mean that the coalition can get away with adjustments of less than (EURO)2bn in October's budget. But the very strict fiscal rules, imposed by the EU, mean the government's room for manoeuvre remains pretty limited over the next couple of years, and probably far beyond that. You wouldn't have thought so if you were to listen to the messages from government about tax cuts; free GP care for all, public sector pay increases and reduced cuts in spending. You have to assume neither Mr Noonan nor Mr Howlin is envisaging taking on the EU and its fiscal rules. Even if it could win that battle, the financial markets wouldn't wear it and there would be an obvious impact on our borrowing rates. Which begs the question: ""What is the coalition playing at?"" Some of what we're seeing is good old-fashioned panic in the wake of the local election meltdown. Government figures wrongly see austerity as the source of all their problems and they want to move as far away from it as possible - or isn't possible more likely. To be fair, they do have a tricky balancing act to maintain. In political terms, they can't, on the one hand, argue the economy is back and on the other hand maintain that the pain has to continue. Or at least, it's very difficult to do so when the electorate is fed up swallowing the tough medicine. There had been voices in the coalition arguing that the government had to keep doing the 'right thing' and that when voters saw the benefits of the recovery, Fine Gael and Labour would ultimately reap the rewards. Whether the strategy was right or wrong, those voices appear to have been silenced since the local elections, certainly in Labour. The mood music has changed and the loss of the experienced trio of Quinn, Eamon Gilmore and Pat Rabbitte from cabinet can only exacerbate that. However, the obvious danger for the coalition is that, given the financial constraints, they cannot possibly meet the expectations they now risk unleashing. Of course, the tough decisions taken by both parties have been a factor in their poor poll ratings. But they shouldn't forget that it was the ludicrous over-promising in the run-up to the last general election that first alienated voters. Right now, they're in danger of repeating the mistake. Instead of fretting about what happened in 1997, they should focus on the lessons of 2011. End of the emergency?

244,Irish Independent,27/01/2016,Central Bank makes direct appeal to voters ahead of General Election,"THE Central Bank's chief economist has urged voters and political parties to be cautious and prudent given the extent of the risks facing the economy. As parties prepare for the General Election, both chief economist Gabriel Fagan and newly installed governor Philip Lane called on the next government to do more to slash debt and deficit levels. Despite the global markets turmoil and concern of a slowdown in China, the bank gave an upbeat assessment of the economy overall, saying the pick-up in spending and continuing strength of employment growth confirms that a ""convincing"" recovery is well established. The bank's latest quarterly bulletin said the performance of the economy reflects a recovery which is broad based and has increasingly come to be driven by a significant rebound in domestic demand. Growth last year as measured by GDP was estimated at 6.6pc, and is forecast to ease to 4.8pc this year and 4.4pc in 2017, it said. But Mr Fagan said that despite the strong numbers, there are significant risks, from both the high, although declining, levels of both public and private debt, and the threat posed to the global economy. He repeatedly urged prudence, and said his call wasn't confined to politicians. ""It's a message not just to parties; it's a message to the country as a whole, to the voters and to society as whole,"" he said. ""We've done a lot of progress; tremendous achievements have been made on the fiscal side. But be careful, there are risks out there, there are vulnerabilities there, so be cautious and be prudent. That's essentially our message."" Mr Fagan said if there is scope, more should be done to slash both the debt and deficit to build up ""as many buffers as can be built up"". ""If it is at all possible, given the risks that the economy faces, to go for a more ambitious, a faster pace of deficit reduction, which would imply a faster pace of debt reduction,"" he said. ""Serious consideration should be given to using that [fiscal] space, given the vulnerabilities that the economy faces."" It was a view echoed by Governor Lane later at the Oireachtas Finance Committee, when he said the next government needs to focus on reducing debt levels. ""You're about to go to election mode, but I would hope that the next Government takes seriously that you have to reconcile not just genuine public spending needs, but also the importance of getting back to a safe level of public www.debt.No easy task,"" he said. Oil extended its slide below $30 a barrel yesterday and Chinese stocks took another plunge amid concern about the country's slowing economy and confusion over China's central bank's foreign exchange policy. Luca Onorante, the Central Bank's acting head of monetary policy, said there is considerable uncertainty facing the global economy. ""There is uncertainty from the financial side, there is uncertainty about the numbers, there is uncertainty about what the connections are between a change in monetary policy in the United States and to what extend it may affect other emerging market economies, especially those that have a high level of debt in dollars,"" he said. ""This is a global phenomena, but the numbers as we have shown them today are subject to a clear downward risk."" The bank's latest quarterly bulletin, despite the risks posed, sates that Ireland is going through a period of ""exceptional"" growth. The bank said outside factors have also contributed to the strong recovery, including lower energy prices. ""Growth has also benefited from a more benign policy environment, reflected in both the easing of the pace of fiscal consolidation and continued favourable financial conditions, while additional support has been provided by the ongoing improvement in household and firm balance sheets and continued favourable financial conditions in Ireland's main export markets."" Rising employment has helped stimulate a strong pickup in consumer spending, which last year grew at its fastest rate since 2007. The bulletin said domestic demand is expected to be the main driver of growth over the coming period, with a robust outlook for both consumption and investment spending.

1209,Irish Independent,08/10/2016,Sterling slump raises fears of Brexit-driven currency crisis,"TWO days ago analysts wondered whether the euro would hit 90 pence by the end of the year - a level it blasted through yesterday morning. This week's sterling's slump to its lowest in over 30 years has raised fears that Britain's exit from the European Union could yet trigger a currency crisis like those of 1967, 1976 or 1992. By some measures, such as the speed of losses and volatility of its market trading, the pound is showing crisis-like symptoms. Most observers expect it to fall further on the foreign exchanges before it stabilises. But for a classic 'currency crisis' to unfold, sterling losses would have to choke off the foreign portfolio investments critical to balancing the economy's massive external payments deficit. That risks a spiral of selling of UK bonds and stocks, sinking the currency further, stoking inflation and complicating the central bank's ability to ease credit more if needed to support the real economy. For investors fearing such a vicious circle there were worrying signs yesterday that overseas holders of UK assets may be losing their nerve. The UK is unusually reliant on international capital and if investors become nervous about owning sterling assets - including bonds, shares and propery - it could spark real problems. The last three days have seen UK government bonds and domestically-exposed mid-sized stocks fall in tandem with the pound for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum. The selling has not yet turned into a rout, however. Few observers are flagging a match with prior sterling crises just yet, even if the economic, political and financial uncertainty unleashed by Brexit is likely to cast a dark cloud over the currency for some time. The crisis in 1967 saw sterling come off the gold standard and devalue; in 1976 Britain 'Worrying signs that overseas holders of UK assets may be losing their nerve' was forced to seek a multi-billion dollar aid package from the International Monetary Fund; and in 1992 billionaire investor George Soros famously ""broke the Bank of England"" when Britain was ejected from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the pre-cursor to the euro. Market veterans reckon for the current turmoil to turn into a crisis, there would have to be clear evidence foreign funds and central banks were losing faith in the UK economy and policy framework, and offloading their UK assets accordingly. Britain has the biggest current account deficit in the developed world at nearly 6pc of its annual economic output. In the words of Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney, it relies on the ""kindness of strangers"" to fund the gap. If that flow of capital dries up, Britain has a problem. This has been the root cause of most emerging market currency crises in recent decades, notably in Mexico in 1995, Thailand in 1997 and Brazil in 1998. Around 5pc of the world's known central bank foreign currency reserves are in British pounds, the equivalent of more than $350bn, according to the International Monetary Fund. That is the third largest holding, behind US dollars (63pc) and euro (20pc). More than half of UK stocks are held by overseas investors, according to Britain's Office for National Statistics (ONS). Foreign holdings were less than 10pc in the 1970s and 1980s, and stood at around 35pc at the turn of the century. Nearly a third of investors in British government bonds are from abroad, ONS data shows. That equated to £500bn worth at the end of June. ""This is not a sterling crisis, but it has the potential to become one,"" said Nick Parsons, global co-head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, and a 30-year veteran of the currency market. David Bloom, HSBC global head of FX strategy, said investors have not called time on UK Plc. ""Foreign holders of UK assets will not be worried, at least not yet. This is an adjustment. Nobody should be surprised. Adjustments can be smooth or they can be rocky, but policymakers will be concerned."" The volatility comes at the end of a tumultuous week, kicked off by Prime Minister Theresa May saying said she would trigger the process to leave the EU by the end of March. Markets took fright, interpreting this to mean there will be a ""hard"" Brexit with Britain having less access to the European Single Market. Investors were also taken aback when May criticised the ""bad side effects"" of the BoE's low interest rates and bond-buying. Aides said she was not trying to influence Mr Carney but some saw the comments as a warning to the Canadian who is in the process of deciding whether to extend his governorship beyond his scheduled departure in 2018. Alan Clarke, an economist with Scotiabank in London, said sterling's post-referendum fall was set to add up to 2 percentage points to consumer price inflation, which he now thought would peak at 2.6pc in November 2017. So far, the BoE has sat on the sidelines and allowed sterling to find its own level. (Reuters)",1,monetary,financial markets,,,,uk
286,Irish Independent,22/02/2017,Clear timeline from the Taoiseach will put 'Ireland First',"LBEIT inadvertently, Finian McGrath hit the nail on the head with his intervention at yesterday's Cabinet meeting. ""Taoiseach, we're concerned about the instability in Government. Is there any update on that?"" he subtly asked Enda Kenny on the elephant in the room of the Taoiseach's leadership of Fine Gael and the Government. Mr Kenny told the Cabinet he intends to address the issue at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting tonight. Mr McGrath's point was the leadership issue needed to be dealt with so the Government can function properly. ""We need a speedy conclusion to that particular debate so that we can all focus on the day job. The leadership issue is a bit of a distraction, but it needs to be resolved and I'm confident the Taoiseach will resolve it over the next couple of days,"" he said. His view about distractions was echoed by Éamon Ó Cuív, Fianna Fáil spokesman on Regional Development, Rural Affairs and the Gaeltacht, who rightly pointed out on TG4's '7 Lá' last night that there were crises in health, housing and transport requiring attention. The country cannot afford a lengthy distraction and further stasis within the system. Already, the public service will begin to wind down in anticipation of a change of minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in the wake of the election of a new Taoiseach. Yesterday, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) revealed the number of people in employment is now above 2 million. The latest Quarterly National Household Survey, the official measure of employment and unemployment in the State, shows unemployment fell by 40,000 last year, leaving the unemployment rate at 7.1pc. This is the lowest unemployment rate since the second quarter of 2008. Also, the number of people in work increased by 3.3pc last year, or 65,000, bringing the number of people in employment to 2,048,100. It's the 17th quarter in a row in which employment increased. There were 147,000 people classed as unemployed at the end of 2016, a drop of 21pc from the same period a year previously. Mr Kenny ought to be credited with his leadership of two governments which took the country from the desperation of the economic crash back to this level of job creation. The recovery is far from complete and it's a vastly different country to the height of the Celtic Tiger boom of a decade ago. But, unquestionably, there is progress being made and the CSO figures showed a satisfactory geographic spread to the jobs being created. Given the challenges the economy will face as a result of Brexit and the international uncertainty caused by the election of US President Donald Trump, there is no room for complacency. Finance Minister Michael Noonan has stepped into the breach to try to get concerned Fine Gael backbenchers to hold off on making a move against Mr Kenny. In a series of private meetings, the veteran minister urged his colleagues to pull back from threats of a no confidence motion. Mr Kenny will stave off any such direct assault on his leadership if he is clear in the timeline he sets out tonight. This is not an internal Fine Gael matter. The leadership of the country at this time is of national importance. Tonight, the Taoiseach must set aside party consideration and adopt a definite policy of 'Ireland First'.

658,Irish Independent,20/02/2008,Government is accused of blowing the economic boom,"THE Government was accused last night of ""blowing the boom"", after the EU Commission said Ireland had little information on how it intends meeting goals for strict control of public spending.  The EU Commission, in its annual comment on the country's budgetary plans, also said that over-spending in 2007 had reduced the Government's room for manoeuvre as the economy slows.  The damning report was seized on by Fine Gael as further proof of the Government's mismanagement of the economy.  Fine Gael's Richard Bruton said Tanaiste Brian Cowen had left the country unable to deal with the worsening economic crisis. The EC had fired a warning shot about the slowdown in the economy, he said.  ""In no uncertain terms it pinpoints the collapse in the public finances, the housing slowdown, the busted export markets and the pension crisis. None of this is in any way surprising and can all be laid squarely at Brian Cowen's feet,"" he said.  But a spokesman for Finance Minister Brian Cowen said the Government had started the process of slowing public spending in line with the economic growth and this would continue over the next few years.  ""We are not slamming on the brakes. This is a phased process and will continue in coming years, to get the growth in public spending below the rate of growth in the economy,"" he said.  The Commission is happy enough that budgetary targets this year will be met. These envisage a deficit of just under 1pc of output (GDP), based on a 9pc increase in day-to-day government spending. But it wants to know more about how progress is to be achieved in the following two years, when growth is projected to average 3.8pc.  Contained  ""There is a lack of information about what broad measures will be taken, so that current spending growth will be contained below nominal GDP growth, especially as regards the public wage bill and social transfer payments, both of which have increased substantially in recent years,"" it said.  The report comes just as difficult negotiations on wages are about to begin. Unless the public sector pay bill, which includes both wages and staff numbers, rises more slowly than economic growth of around 6.5pc in money terms, it will be difficult for the Government to meet its targets.  In several recent speeches, Mr Cowen has stressed the need for modest wage increase in any new national agreement. ""The minister has given clear signals on that,"" the spokesman said.  Committed  ""The Government is also committed to maintaining the full investment spending in the National Development Programme. That has to be taken into account in any discussion on the budget numbers,"" he said.  The Commission noted that last year's deficit was almost 1.4bn larger than original budget targets, due to over-spending and lower than expected revenues from the housing market. It suggests that its 2007 advice to guard against a housing downturn had not been taken.  Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton TD said the report, ""is further proof that Minister for Finance Brian Cowen blew the boom.""  The Commission said more reform of the pension system would be needed if the projected doubling of pension costs over the next 20 years was to be met.  The Commission also warned that Ireland faces a period of lower growth, ""characterised by a deterioration in competitiveness because of recent adverse productivity and price developments, exacerbated by its exposure to the US and UK economies"".

1349,The Irish Times,23/04/2010,Tourism can help us along the road to recovery,"ECONOMICS:Tourism came to the aid of our economy in past downturns and it may do so again if we adopt the right policies, writes JIM DEEGAN IN AN economy where GDP declined by 3 per cent in 2008 and 7.1 per cent in 2009 it is clear that the road to recovery will be slow, arduous and challenging. The attempt to meet our commitment to reducing the budget deficit to less than 3 per cent by 2014 will continue to impose significant constraints on domestic consumption and employment growth. Moreover, there is a need to recognise that some of the losses in employment are permanent due to the unsustainable levels of spending associated with a spending/borrowing splurge that is well and truly over. Nonetheless, the recent retail spending figures and the forecast of the Economic and Social Research Institute for the years ahead suggest that the worst may be over or coming to an end. It is therefore timely to consider what economic activity is likely to propel the renaissance of the Irish economy. Given the poor budgetary position, public expenditure growth is unthinkable so the most immediate possibility is export-led economic growth. Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world. In 2008 exports plus imports were equivalent to 150 per cent of GDP. In fact, net exports were the only component of growth in the Irish economy in 2009 as consumption, government spending and investment collapsed. On the export front it is vital to recognise that some fundamental restructuring has taken place in the Irish economy in recent years. For example, in 2001 merchandise exports comprised 75 per cent of export earnings and services comprised the 25 per cent balance, yet by 2010 the respective figures were 53 and 47 per cent. Ireland like most developed economies is now heavily reliant on services for our economic development, a point often overlooked in policy discussions. The structural change in the Irish economy reflects a worldwide movement whereby advanced economies move from the production of commodities to the servicing of commodities (known as Prodcom to Servcom). While there has been legitimate focus on the performance of business, financial and computer services in recent years, it is clear that the financial services element looks uncertain in the current context. Therefore, we must look to other services to bolster our exports and tourism provides fertile ground. A detailed analysis of the tourism sector reveals some important lessons for Ireland s overall economic performance. Very briefly, the evidence informs us that tourism has often been very important to the Irish economy when we hit the ropes and it may come to our aid again if we adopt the correct policies. The evidence alluded to above comes from our past experience. In the early post second World War years when the economy was extremely weak, the earnings from tourism surpassed that of agriculture, yet policy failures led to the industry entering a fairly fallow period until the 1980s. The evidence from the mid-1980s, when the economy was on the verge of collapse is that tourism virtually exploded until 2001. Table 1 provides the detail and warrants some explanation. The evidence from tourism literature is that the sector prospers in circumstances where there is a good macroeconomic environment (competitiveness), there is good external access and there is good tourism product. A review of Ireland in the early 1980s would have shown that Ireland was expensive to get to because of very poor competition policy on aviation, we were very expensive when someone arrived because of poor macroeconomic management (not competitive) and there was little to do (poor investment in product). Once Ireland tackled these respective problems through liberalisation of air transport, good competitiveness measures and investment in product our fortunes changed dramatically. It is also clear that tourism hit somewhat of a crossroads in 2001 and while growth did resume to 2007, it was far more muted and the wheels really came off the wagon in 2008 and 2009. From 1985 to 2007 in euro terms (excluding carrier receipts) the earnings from tourism in nominal terms increased from EUR 583 million to EUR 3.94 billion before falling back to EUR 3.1 billion in 2009. Interestingly, the decline in this export performance was masked by a major surge in domestic tourism which is not sustainable in my view. So what is to be done?. We must first of all learn from the past. Competitiveness matters and everything must be done to improve the conditions under which tourism firms operate. Secondly, our aviation policy is in need of serious evaluation, what we learned in the 1980s seems to have been forgotten. Why do we subsidise so many airports and why do we have so many, especially now that our road infrastructure is so much improved. We seem focused on dissipating critical mass when the airline sector craves large population bases. Finally, the tourism sector is increasingly influenced by the ability of firms to develop innovative products and to promote them with new forms of information technology. Ireland is way behind on this and we need to situate tourism in the centre of policies of innovation and the smart economy . International tourism has proven incredibly resilient to major turbulence in the world economy since the 1950s and all forecasts suggest it will increase dramatically in the years ahead. An improved tourism performance is well within our grasp and as an indigenous industry it can help alleviate our dependence on foreign investment. Prof Jim Deegan is the director of the National Centre for Tourism Policy Studies and Department of Economics, Kemmy Business School, University of Limerick. He has organised the first annual tourism policy workshop at Dromoland Castle, Co Clare this weekend.",0,,,,,,
1371,The Irish Times,22/05/2009,Uncertainty adds to developers' gloom over agency,"Brian Lenihan s failure to spell out how Nama will work has led to paralysis in the sector, writes ARTHUR BEESLEY, Senior Business Correspondent AMONG PROPERTY developers big and small, deep gloom about the arrival of the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) is matched by huge confusion about its policies and mode of operation. Amid rampant fear that many established players might be obliterated by the new agency, the failure of Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan to set out exactly how Nama will work has led to a sense of paralysis in the property sector and fevered speculation. In a community accustomed to easy profit and the luxury lifestyle, a sense of profound uncertainty pervades. Big-timers such as Seán Dunne, Bernard McNamara, Liam Carroll, Paddy Kelly and many other players of scale became prominent figures in their own right in the boom. And for every big player, hundreds of others have smaller-scale operations throughout the State. Each and every one of their development loans good, bad or middling and valued up EUR 90 billion are to be shunted into Nama. Easy it will not be. Some debts runs to billions, others to hundreds of millions. All will go to Nama. Some of the major developers flew helicopters to work when times were good, their weekend camaraderie a fixture of the social pages. But supersized leverage and the implicit belief that the economic expansion would never end imbued the sector with massive risk. The brutal economic contraction has thrown all that into stark relief, with dire consequences for Ireland s public finances and its shaky banking system. Developers were the princes of the boom, the largest borrowers in a banking frenzy that led once-secure financial institutions to the brink of collapse. Unable to repay their loans, a large number of big borrowers are now the beneficiaries of generous forbearance from banks. Their main worry is that Nama will lead them into foreclosure and bankruptcy. After all, the bleak economic situation is all the worse for the banking crisis and its resolution will impose a yet unquantified cost on taxpayers for decades to come. Thus, developers fear that Nama will be used as an instrument of symbolic retribution for the excesses of the boom by doling out public floggings to them. Never mind that Government policies and lax regulation reinforced the lending extravaganza. The coalition is already in line for a severe hammering in local and European elections next month and two byelections in Dublin. Notwithstanding Fianna Fáil s traditional proximity to the property community, developers fear Nama will seek to take scalps to demonstrate its determination to address the problem. Anger at tax increases and dismay at the crippling loss of jobs as more and more companies succumb to the recession is such that there is little public sympathy for developers who cannot repay their loans. Where developers attribute the fortunes they made in the boom to entrepreneurial verve, others see greed. They were big beneficiaries when the price of residential and commercial property zoomed upwards. On the other side of the table, home buyers and businesses in other sectors paid out in spades for property inflation. Nama s objective is to restore fiscal stability to the banks so that they start lending again, a sine qua non for any economic recovery. But the plan is fraught with complexity and uncertainty over its precise contours. That the scale of the job carries with it the danger of overwhelming those in charge is but one of several problems. The sense of confusion was underscored a week ago at the Committee of Public Accounts by Dr Michael Somers, head of the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and a crucial figure in the Government s efforts to calm the banks. Although Nama will operate under the umbrella of the NTMA, Somers said he did not know how the new body will work.  I know very little, apart from what has appeared in the newspapers, said Somers, who hosted the press conference at which the plan was announced by Lenihan. The decision on the establishment of Nama was announced in the April supplementary Budget and that it would be done under the aegis and the auspices of both words were used the NTMA. What more do I know? I do not know a vast amount.  Peter Bacon s grand plan has a certain elegance: bank balance sheets cleaned up by transferring good and bad loans to Nama, good loans yielding income for the State and bad loans are run off by the agency in the hope of a return years down the line. What works in theory, however, says nothing about practicalities in real life or of the prickly conundrums that will inevitably arise. Questions abound. How will Nama achieve consistency in its treatment of developers? How will cross-colateralised loans be treated? How will loans syndicated between banks participating in Nama and non-participants be treated? How will Nama treat partnerships and joint ventures between developers, some of whom may be struggling financially alongside co-investors who are not struggling? There is more. Will Nama close down developers over poorly performing loans even if their better loans are still being repaid? To what extent will Nama provide working capital to developers to finish off incomplete projects? If Nama keeps some developers who aren t repaying loans afloat in the interests of the project at large, how will it justify closing down others? Then there is the possibility of legal challenge. Although Lenihan says he doesn t want Nama to create a lawyers bonanza , senior legal sources say the system could be open to challenge on grounds of appropriation of assets at an under-value . Lawyers do not typically resist litigation so the courts are likely be busy. Therefore, it may ultimately fall to the Supreme Court to determine whether the plan is in keeping with the Constitution. To get to that point, however, could involve huge delays. Nevertheless, several property sources said there was little enough interest in new developers organisation proposed in recent week by Seán Dunne. Any legal challenges, they said, were more likely to come from individual developers. For their part, banks are making tentative preparations for the transfer of assets to Nama by consolidating files on individual borrowers, their loan portfolios and their projects. With many borrowers deep under water, banks have already taken big bites from the equity put forward by developers in loan deals. In cases where there no equity remains, some lenders are already said to have called in personal guarantees. Where lenders see merit in completing unfinished projects, instead of allowing them fall to ruin, banks have granted expensive mezzanine finance to developers and taken an equity position in the development. In many other situations, banks are simply waiting to Nama to start its work. Developers contacted by The Irish Timesthis week stuck to their habitual reluctance to speak in public about their business affairs, but all said the absence of firm information was a big concern. I m probably the worst man to talk to, given that I don t know anything about it. I don t understand it, said one senior figure. This view was mirrored a report published by Merrion Stockbrokers, based on the results of a survey of management figures in 25 building companies: 76 per cent of respondents answered don t know as they remain unsure as to how the agency is going to operate and how extensive its influence will be. Eight per cent of respondents felt that it will be a positive for the industry and 16 per cent felt that it will be a negative, Merrion said.  Almost all respondents did note, however, that regardless of whether it ends up being a positive or negative for the industry, the uncertainty over how it will function, the time being taken to establish it, which loans will be transferred etc, is causing effective paralysis in the housebuilding industry.  Nama represents the culmination of Lenihan s efforts to save Ireland s banks as he struggles to reassert control over the wider economy. Although the forthcoming legislation has potential to make or break his reputation, speed is of the essence now and there is little scope for error.",1,regulation,,,,,ireland
405,The Irish Times,02/11/2007,Drop in Fianna Fáil support no surprise as floating voters renege on commitment,"A sharp decline in Fianna Fáil and Government support is revealed by the first post-election Irish Times/TNS mrbi poll, writes Damian Loscher, Managing Director of TNS mrbi Satisfaction with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's performance has also fallen noticeably. A spate of high-profile controversial Government decisions may have led voters to voice their concern and reconsider their voting intentions; however, to ascribe this headline decline in full or in large part to a series of bad news stories would be to overlook the dynamics of floating voters and to ignore broader patterns in voting behaviour.   Conducted on October 29th and 30th, among 1,000 adults aged 18 years and upwards, at 100 locations across Ireland, it shows support for Fianna Fáil has dropped to 33 per cent, a fall of eight percentage points since the poll immediately preceding the May general election. Satisfaction with the Government has also taken a drubbing, down to 37 per cent, a fall of 15 percentage points. Viewed from a wider perspective, the decline in support for Fianna Fáil comes as no surprise. After all, the party was tracking between 34 per cent and 37 per cent earlier this year and reached 41 per cent support only in the days immediately prior to the election as floating voters swung behind Bertie Ahern following the televised leaders' debate. These floating voters were, arguably, never likely to stay with Fianna Fáil and may now be suffering from a type of voting dissonance, unsure as to why exactly they voted Fianna Fáil now that the context of an election has been removed. Interestingly, the drop in both the Fianna Fáil first-preference vote and overall Government satisfaction mirrors the trend following the 2002 general election. The 2002 post-election poll showed Fianna Fáil down eight points and government satisfaction down 25 points. These shifts also came against a backdrop of an economic slowdown - a stagnating property market, waning consumer confidence and volatility in international financial markets. The similarity between the 2002 and 2007 post-election environments does not end here. Both then and now the Government made a point of responding decisively to the uncertainty facing the economy by putting in place measures to prevent double-digit increases in public spending and by ruling out a giveaway budget. But if history has a habit of repeating itself, Fianna Fáil can reasonably expect to recover in time, although history also tells us that it may have further to fall before the recovery sets in. It also tells us a change in economic fortunes may be needed to help create the type of climate needed for a strong recovery to take root, which many economic commentators reckon can be less relied upon this time. As members of the Government, the honeymoon for the Greens is over too. In this latest poll, the Green Party registers 5 per cent support, one point lower than when the party was last polled, prior to entering into Government. Contrast this with the outcome in 2002, when the Greens were in opposition and the first Irish Times/TNS mrbi post-election poll showed a gain of three points, lifting support for the party to 8 per cent of first-preference votes. For better or worse, the fortunes of the Greens are inextricably linked to perceptions of Government performance. The PDs are holding their own with 2 per cent of first preference votes. Arguably this 2 per cent is comprised of loyal PD followers, with fair-weather PD voters carried away in the storm. From this base the party must look to grow, although the association between the PDs and problems in the health service makes the task more challenging. Satisfaction with Mary Harney as acting leader of the PDs reflects the public's lack of confidence in the health service, with just 35 per cent of voters expressing satisfaction with her performance as party leader. At 31 per cent, support for Fine Gael is four points higher in today's poll. In the years leading up to the 2007 election, support for Fine Gael had been building slowly, peaking at 31 per cent before fading as the election neared. Thus, Enda Kenny and his team will hope to take up where they left off, with the wind at their backs. Labour will also welcome today's results, registering a significant gain of five percentage points, bringing the party to 15 per cent support. This is not unfamiliar territory for Labour. Not so long ago, before the Mullingar Accord, Labour could be relied upon to deliver poll performances in the mid-teens or higher, and Eamon Gilmore will hope that these gains are more than just anti-Government protest votes, but rather are a sign that previously lapsed voters have reconnected with the party's new leadership. In much the same way that the PDs cannot claim to be basking in the glow of positive media coverage, Sinn Féin too has been keeping a low media profile. At 7 per cent, Sinn Féin seems to be appealing to a core group of supporters, with no evidence to suggest that the party has benefited from the electorate's swing away from Fianna Fáil. This year's election was followed by a raft of leadership changes and today's poll provides the first glimpse of how satisfied voters are with performances to date. Brian Cowen, the new Tánaiste, tops the leaders' satisfaction poll with a 49 per cent satisfaction rating, ahead of Bertie Ahern, who has lost 15 percentage points since May and has dropped into second place with 43 per cent satisfaction. It is not unknown for the Taoiseach to be beaten in the popularity stakes (for example, Mary Harney managed it on several occasions), but for the Taoiseach to be outdone by a Minister for Finance in uncertain economic times may raise a few eyebrows. The battle for third position on the leader board is hotly contested between Enda Kenny (with 42 per cent satisfaction), Gerry Adams (41 per cent) and John Gormley (40 per cent). Eamon Gilmore, the new Labour Party leader, records just 30 per cent satisfaction, some way adrift of the level achieved by Pat Rabbitte just prior to the election (49 per cent). That said, with 49 per cent of voters yet to form an opinion on Mr Gilmore, it would be more accurate to conclude that his true satisfaction rating is yet to emerge. Today's poll tells us much about how preferences have changed in the six months since the election. Perhaps more interesting is what it reveals about the cyclical nature of voting patterns. It suggests that in good times we want a government that will listen, whereas in bad times (or at election time) we want a government that will lead. If this is true, Brian Cowen is correct in thinking a cautious budget is worth the short-term electoral pain because it will translate into electoral gain when it matters, in 2012.

674,The Irish Times,24/07/2020,"Government spends big but economy on knife edge; Were Covid-19 to persist in hitting activity in a serious way, the numbers would start to look more difficult","It isn't often that a government can pump billions of euro into the economy and still be so unsure about its impact on growth. Yet we all know that the vital thing to count in the months ahead is not the amount of cash the Government is spending, but the daily number of new cases of Covid-19. To revive the economy, first and foremost we have to control the virus. We are still in the emergency stage of trying to limit the economic damage. For the moment the challenge is to hold on to as much of what we have as possible. The first job is replacing the cash taken out of the economy - by the closure of much of the private sector for a period - with additional public money. And saving as many jobs as possible. When the measures in the stimulus package are added in, the scale of the injection of public funds since the crisis started is big - very big. Public spending is now running EUR 16 billion higher for the year than expected before the crisis hit and when falling tax revenues are also counted in the deficit will climb towards EUR 30 billion.  This is within the range previously indicated by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe - indeed if recent tax trends continue, the borrowing figure could still ease back a bit. The Government has now gone big on this and while it will still have a few bullets to fire later in the year, it has used up a fair bit of its ammunition. In particular, extending the wage subsidy scheme until next April will cost the guts of an extra EUR 2 billion and is by far the most significant announcement. Even though payment rates will fall, it will give businesses some certainty heading into 2021 - and many still desperately need the support. Delicate line  The national economic plan due to be published in the autumn will try to make sense of what this means for the long-term fiscal outlook. Previous work by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council suggests that if the virus is controlled, the public finances can gradually turn the corner back to sustainability. But were Covid-19 to persist in hitting activity in a serious way well into 2021, the numbers would start to look more difficult. We are walking a delicate line.  Yet there is no option but to act. The goal of the stimulus plan is to try to prevent further damage by stopping businesses from closing and trying to keep people in jobs. This is where the big money in the stimulus plan is going, particularly in the wage subsidy programme. The vital policy goal is to try to minimise what is called in jargon ""scarring"" - the long-term impact on the economy from the crisis. Unfortunately, no matter how much is spent, there will be a fair bit of this. The autumn may not look too pretty. Elsewhere the plan tries to address a few of the obvious problems. SMEs have had to pay a lot of fixed costs despite being closed or trading well below capacity and will now benefit from larger cash grants and an extension in rates relief. There are a range of new programmes to help unemployed people retrain and encourage employers to take them on as employees or apprentices. One of the things we will see in the months ahead is the State moving back big time into jobs market policy.  There are plans to boost investment in a number of areas to support activity and packages for the arts and tourism sectors. Cutting the VAT rate from 23 per cent to 21 per cent will cost north of EUR 400 million and is designed to boost investment - but it is hard to see it having a major impact on people's spending decisions or on business margins.  Key sectors  Better, perhaps to have used the money for more direct supports to key sectors - like tourism. Likewise the staycation scheme will be popular, but it will end up giving a lot of people a refund on money they would have spent anyway.  Some of this is more about politics than economics. But yet many of the worst-affected sectors say the Government should have done more. This goes to the heart of the problem of trying to get the economy going again. People remain nervous about a revival in the numbers catching the virus and a second or subsequent waves. For many, with savings built up during the lockdown, this is the key thing stopping them from going out to spend more. They are not short of cash, they are short of confidence. And this points to the uncertainty facing many consumer-facing sectors of the economy, particularly in tourism and hospitality but also parts of the retail sector and the arts and entertainment sectors. For many sectors, while government support is vital for short-term survival, the real determining factor over the next few years will be how consumers behave. Are they happy to eat out, go back to work in the city centre, stay in a hotel, go to a gym, get on a plane and so on?  Ideally, economic policy would move out of the emergency phase and into longer-term planning by autumn. This is the intention, with the development of a national economic plan to accompany the budget. We must hope that we are out of the worst of the economic fire-fighting phase at that stage. But, as of now, we just don't know - and health experts talk of a risk of a second wave in the winter.  With Brexit also threatening trouble , we are in for a bumpy economic ride.",1,disaster,elections,,,,ireland
752,The Irish Times,11/03/2015,Improving economy makes India a rising force,"The most significant economic story of the past 3Â½ decades has been the rise of China. The second most significant story has been the rise of India. A big question is how fast the latter can grow. The answer is that it has an excellent chance of being the fastest-growing large economy in the world. But this requires significant improvements in policy and its implementation. The government of prime minister Narendra Modi, elected last May, has at least made a start. Between 1980 and 2014, China's average gross domestic product per head grew 17 times, according to the International Monetary Fund. In the same period, India's GDP per head grew fourfold. That is a huge gulf. But India's achievements are significant. Hundreds of millions of Indians have experienced identifiable improvements in their living standards. Furthermore, the country has many strengths: a legitimate political system; a youthful population; substantial technological and entrepreneurial resources; and, not least, room to catch up on the world's richest economies. According to the IMF, India's GDP per head at purchasing power parity was 11 per cent of that of the US in 2014. China passed that mark a decade earlier. This lag is an opportunity. Growth is not everything. But, for a country as poor as India, it is necessary for alleviating mass destitution and widening opportunity. The immediate conjuncture is also favourable for a shift to higher growth. This year's government Economic Survey of India waxes lyrical, arguing that the country has reached ""a sweet spot - rare in the history of nations - in which it could finally be launched on a double-digit medium-term growth trajectory"". The international environment is favourable, particularly low oil prices and recovery in the US and Europe. As the survey notes, the deceleration in growth has ended and the economy appears to be recovering. Moreover, it adds, ""challenges in other major economies have made India the near-cynosure of eager investors"". Yet the idea that India is on the verge of 10 per cent growth is vainglorious. The slowdown after 2010 punctured a similar euphoria. True, in 2008, gross investment reached 33 per cent of GDP, before falling to 28 per cent last year. Yet even 33 per cent is likely to be insufficient to drive growth at a sustained 10 per cent a year. When China grew that fast, its investment rate was more than 35 per cent of GDP and in many years far higher. Also, as the Indian budget recognises, shortage of physical capital, particularly infrastructure, remains a binding constraint. Without big changes, 8 per cent is a likely upper bound to the growth rate.  How far, then, has the new government improved the economic prospects? A part of the answer is that it has been fortunate: the collapse in the price of oil has been a pure windfall. Another is that Mr Modi's election has improved confidence. As an IMF paper has argued, the sharp slowdown in investment that was the proximate cause of India's recent decline in growth, was partly due to rising uncertainty ahead of the election. But a final part of the answer is that the government is making sensible reforms, though, as was to be expected in India's complex democracy, these have fallen far short of a pro-market ""big bang"". Yet note that the World Bank's Doing Businessranking places India 142 out of 189 countries. Given this, modest reforms might deliver significant improvements in performance. Changes Which of the changes announced before the budget and within it are likely to be important? Deregulating the price of diesel was a good signal, though the opportunity afforded by low oil prices made it easy. So, too, is the shift towards open auctions of licences to mine coal.  Plans to move towards direct cash transfers to the poor could reduce the costs of in-kind benefits and subsidies. Unfortunately, the budget did not make substantial reforms to wasteful expenditures. Important, too, is the decision to move towards a national goods and services tax. This is a vital step towards creating a single market, something that India still lacks. Also significant is the new ""monetary policy framework agreement"" with the Reserve Bank of India, which takes the country towards a modern relationship between government and central bank. Another big (and controversial) reform would make land acquisition less onerous, thus easing development. From the economic point of view, the most important near-term requirement must be a massive improvement in infrastructure. That should also promote private sector entrepreneurship and investment.  Good sense The government decided to delay fiscal consolidation, in order to finance public investment. If the investment is efficient, this makes good sense. An economy where nominal GDP is likely to grow by at least 12 per cent a year in the medium term can run a sizeable fiscal deficit while keeping its public debt well under control. In India, fiscal deficits matter to the extent that they crowd out private investment, which is not much of a concern at present, or are used to fund wasteful spending. Consolidation is not a particularly high priority right now. In its presentation of the economic survey, the office of the chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, refers to the possibility that ""a persistent, encompassing and creative incrementalism"" might add up to quite a bang.  Whether such incrementalism will be delivered is still unclear. But, provided the government persists with reforms and keeps the scale of the opportunity in mind, the economy should now revive. Sustained growth of 7-8 per cent a year is possible. More is at least conceivable. The change within India and in its relationship with the world will also be incremental. But a new force is rising. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015",1,geopolitical,covid,,,,india
220,The Irish Times,14/07/2016,Can our political system adjust to the new reality of semi-tight budgets?; The budget cannot possibly satisfy all the demands faced by the Government,"Economic growth is a mixed blessing for politicians.Without doubt it is preferable to the opposite problem. But it lumbers governments with an avalanche of expectations from interest groups, from their own backbenchers and, ultimately, from the public, which they cannot meet.  Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe was frank about this yesterday: he will not be able to meet anything like all the requests - many of them worthy. Governing in recession requires a grim-faced resolution and a thick skin; but politics in a time of plenty is a subtle art of balancing interests and managing expectations. Saying no all the time is easier than saying no some of the time. Tax cuts  Legally and financially it will be hard for the Government to deviate substantially from the plans published yesterday. That means a relatively limited amount of money - EUR 350 million for tax cuts, EUR 600 million for new current spending, EUR 250 million for new capital spending - will be available on budget day.  That will not move much, if at all. Aside from the fiscal and legal realities of EU spending rules, Donohoe has to establish his credibility in his first budget.  It is abundantly clear from the dry prose of yesterday's document that the constant overspending of health budgets remain a huge worry.  The document notes that the health budget increased 6 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 2015. Even a 3 per cent increase next year would eat up one-third of the available fiscal space. The department received a EUR 500 million mid-year top-up a few weeks ago, contingent on ""an improved governance and accountability framework"", as yesterday's document states.  Boom-bust  In a larger sense Ireland and its politics are still adjusting after the roller-coaster boom-bust of the last two decades. The immediately previous two eras in the public finances were very unusual. During the boom period budgets increased substantially every year - 12-14 per cent a year spending growth was typical in the 2002-2007 government under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen - while taxes were repeatedly reduced.  That was followed by a painful bust, when the opposite happened. Spending was cut every year while taxes were hiked.  The country has now emerged into a more normal, stable fiscal environment. Strong economic growth has returned even if there is some doubt as to its extent after extraordinary and - everyone agrees - misleading figures for growth from the CSO this week.  But the reality of Ireland's high level of debt, the EU rules to which we are legally signed up after a referendum and the external uncertainties of the world mean that any government will feel compelled to be as cautious as political reality allows.  We are entering an era of semi-permanent, semi-tight budgets. This is the new fiscal reality.  One of the central questions of Irish politics is whether our political system can adjust to that reality.",1,fiscal,india election,,,,ireland
1315,The Irish Times,02/09/2021,The post-Kabul presidency; Joe Biden and Afghanistan,"Foreign policy decisions and outcomes do not normally determine the results of US elections, which usually hinge on economic wellbeing and domestic concerns. That abiding truth about American politics is guiding president Joe Biden's efforts to deflect criticism of his hastily executed and chaotic exit from Afghanistan. He hopes to benefit from the 70 per cent voter support for ending the war and can point to the huge evacuation effort and a clearcut determination to meet the declared deadline. Against these positives are set the intelligence, political and alliance failures he must now tackle. Standing out from the immediate drama, tragedies and strategic uncertainties of the past three weeks - in which the Afghan army's resistance to Taliban advances collapsed, the Afghan government fled and the Biden administration acted without consulting Nato allies - are several fundamental features of continuity in US policy. Biden has executed the Afghan withdrawal laid down but not delivered on by the Obama and Trump presidencies; he has tied that in with a pivot to Asia and a geopolitical fixation with China's threat to US dominance they shared; and he combines these policies with a common concern to reduce US overseas intervention. This longer-term strategy is what he wants to achieve, in the firm belief it accords with what most US voters want. There is plenty of evidence for that and his Republican opponents know it. Biden should be judged by how he deals with the mistakes he has made along the way, by his ability to show leadership and competence as he does so, and then by how the Afghan exit affects his ambitious domestic agenda of economic recovery and reconstruction, linked to a successful Covid-19 vaccination campaign. It is too soon to reach firm conclusions on any of these issues. There were moments in the past weeks when the president appeared overwhelmed by and vulnerable to the rapidity of events, raising questions about his political capability. But his determination to see his main decision on exit through will stand to him. The US has sufficient power to ride out alliance criticisms and Biden seems reconciled to a less dominant and more decentred world role. Such qualities and policies, if sustained, should insulate his domestic priorities from major damage as important mid-term elections next year test his slim congressional majorities. Biden has brought his long experience of foreign policy making to bear in deciding to get the US out of Afghanistan after 20 years of warfare, the deaths of at least 120,000 Afghans and 2,461 US soldiers and a colossal $1 trillion expenditure. But even if he is correct and there was no real alternative to withdrawal, he must now ensure his presidency is not defined by the mistakes and failures made in executing that decision.",1,security,budget,,,,usa
1326,The Irish Times,24/06/2005,The winning ways of Oracle's founder,"Larry Ellison talks to Karlin Lillington in Valencia about the aggressive takeover of PeopleSoft, Ireland and what lies ahead for one of the world's leading software companies. Larry Ellison doesn't like losing. ""The complete, crushing finality of defeat. It's really devastating,"" he says, making a pained face. But the founder and chief executive of database and enterprise software company Oracle, sitting at a long teak table on one of the numerous decks of his 452-foot yacht Rising Sun (the largest personal yacht in the world), isn't talking about the rough and tumble of the business world, where he recently led a dogged and aggressive takeover of rival PeopleSoft. 20050623223411 He's talking about sports, and more specifically, sailing. Dressed in khakis and a blue and cream team polo shirt, he is fresh from two gruelling back to back, hours-long races in his sleek carbon-fibre hulled boat with his 17-strong Oracle BMW Racing Team, yet an observer might guess he'd spent a relaxing day in his spa two decks down. Ellison, who officially has been the second richest man in the world and who briefly deposed Bill Gates from the number one position (Oracle's shares were up; Microsoft's, down), ranks 10th in the United States now and 12th worldwide with a personal fortune worth $10.7 billion (EUR 8.85 million). In other words, more than enough to fund his passion for sailing and yachts, which has seen him win the Maxi-World Championships three times with another boat, Sayonara, and take the number two slot in the last America's Cup race. He is in Valencia as part of a three-year set of qualifying races that preface the next America's Cup in 2007. Rising Sun, with its discreet staff (also in cream and khaki), is of another magnitude entirely, a low-slung floating hotel. In length, she is longer then a football field; her decor is tasteful, comfortable teak and fabric armchairs and sofas, Japanese style interiors, a grand piano here, a table to seat 24 there, the kind of opulent simplicity extreme wealth and taste can buy. Few outsiders have seen her up close, except the kind of guests a billionaire invites to come sailing (Bill Clinton is currently a favourite pal, says Ellison). ""The thing about sports that is so different from business is that when you lose, it's over. You've lost! It's over!"" He laughs. Business is more ""like a marathon that never stops"", he says. He says the two most notable trends in business in the past five years have been ""inflation and the explosion of the tech bubble. A great many more companies than were needed were created, and there were some spectacular failures. ""But it's not the worst bubble I've ever seen,"" he says, which he believes was the Japanese property bubble. ""This is twice in a 10-year period you saw markets make mistakes of this magnitude,"" he muses. More pain lies ahead, says the man who believes less (at least in terms of companies) is more in the software industry. ""We're going to go through even more consolidation."" That doesn't mean fewer ideas or less new technology, he says: ""It's just that for every new idea, there won't have to be a company around that idea."" Ellison is a big believer in the doctrine of consolidation and in a big company ecosystem, and finds the consolidation phase of any industry ""fascinating"". And yes, he thinks the software industry is going through such a phase and intends to make Oracle one of the major consolidators, not just through big ticket purchases such as PeopleSoft, but smaller acquisitions such as those that have peppered Oracle's press releases in recent weeks: TimesTen, MatchPoint. However, the company's acquisition strategy and the uncertain payoff for shareholders is expected to dampen its share price despite expectations of strong results next week from Oracle, several analysts have said. Some fear another PeopleSoft-sized acquisition might be on the cards as well. Nonetheless Ellison insists, ""The secret to the software business is scale."" Asked if Oracle is considering a bid for rival German company SAP - which Oracle has targeted in its current ""SAP OFF"" advertising campaign to lure SAP users to Oracle, while SAP in turn has begun a verbal offensive against Oracle - Ellison laughs. ""Yeah, like the anti-trust people are going to let the world's number two company Oracle take over the number three company SAP ,"" he says. He warms to a discussion of SAP - a long standing rivalry even at the level of yacht-racing. SAP's co-founder and former CEO (and current board member) Hasso Plattner also races, once famously mooning Ellison and the Oracle racing team after a race, from his boat Morning Glory, and Ellison takes a wicked pleasure in running through all the details. He also enthusiastically discusses the role of education in entrepreneurial success - which he, a college drop-out like fellowbillionaires Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Michael Dell, thinks is about zilch. ""Our education awards a certain degree of conformity that's not very useful in business,"" he says. ""It's no surprise that many entrepreneurs leave college to start companies. I'm sure Galileo would have flunked his astronomy course."" Europe's old style, job-protecting labour laws also work against entrepreneurs and businesses, and hence inward investment, he says. ""I think it's no surprise that the UK has low unemployment and Germany, France and Italy have high unemployment."" He does understand the social intent of such laws, ""but it makes it difficult for us to hire in those countries. And the more protected the labour market and the economy, the more horrific globalisation looks. It's a non-trivial problem and the source of one of the fractures in the EU right now."" What about Ireland? Would the growing costs to do business in the Republic cause Oracle to reconsider its 900 jobs based here? ""Ireland's economy is rocketing - it's the fastest growing economy in the EU. We have to pay more raises there because we have higher turnover there than elsewhere - because there are a lot of other good jobs in the country! We were attracted first by the tax breaks and the lower cost of labour. We still get a low cost and highly skilled labour force there. We're definitely not going to shut down the Irish operation,"" he laughs. ""In terms of growth now, there's a lot going into Romania, the Czech Republic, Hungary. We keep an eye on all of those."" Overall, Europe remains extremely important to Oracle. ""It's the largest market for our software. And I think Europe is doing quite well, but you're in transition, and transitions are painful."" He isn't worried about the US economy, he says, not even the huge budget deficit. ""I think the economy is doing well. No, I'm not worried about the budget deficit versus GDP if you look at profit growth,"" he says. ""Tax receipts are up 17 per cent. Lots of people criticized Bush's tax cuts, but he slashed taxes and tax receipts are up 17 per cent."" Could there be another tech bubble? ""Certainly not anything on the scale we saw."" What would it be driven by? ""A short memory,"" he quips, and laughs. Given the time spent racing yachts (he also enjoys playing the piano, classical guitar, tennis and basketball), does the sailing not intervene with running the second largest software company in the world? ""I spend a lot more time on my company than I do on my boat,"" he says - he notes that he also funds the entire America's Cup venture from his own pocket. ""The most important thing to me is my family he is married to romance novelist Melanie Craft, whose recent novel Man Trouble is about a romance writer who tries to seduce a billionaire . Then my company, then my hobbies."" Would he have liked to have done things differently? ""In my whole life? Yeah! How much time have you got,"" he laughs. ""We joked in Oracle about having a company humility day when you could feel sorry for things you've done. But I've got a reasonable number of things right."" OK, then, what's it like to be one of the most powerful men in the technology world? ""I don't think of itas having power. I think of it as being very lucky. I get to spend a lot of time with interesting people. I get to sail boats. And I really enjoy running Oracle.""",0,,afaganistan evacutaion,,,,
